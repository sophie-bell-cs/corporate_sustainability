PART I
Item 1. Business.
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940, serves customers globally with a
unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases,
equipment, and services. Focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, we provide essential
industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining,
chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. We are the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen
and have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas ("LNG") process
technology and equipment. We develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world’s largest industrial gas
projects, including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the
production of high-value power, fuels, and chemicals and are developing carbon capture projects and world-scale low
carbon and carbon-free hydrogen projects that will support global transportation and energy transition away from fossil
fuels.
As used in this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” "Air Products,"
or “registrant” include controlled subsidiaries, affiliates, and predecessors of Air Products and our controlled
subsidiaries and affiliates.
Except as otherwise noted, the description of our business below reflects our continuing operations. Refer to Note 5,
Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for activity associated with discontinued operations.

Table of Contents
During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 (“fiscal year 2021”), we reported our continuing operations in five
reporting segments under which we managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings: Industrial
Gases – Americas; Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa); Industrial Gases – Asia; Industrial
Gases – Global; and Corporate and other. The discussion that follows is based on those operations. Refer to Note 23,
Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our
reportable business segments.
On 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 October 2021.
Refer to Note 24, Subsequent Events, for additional information.
Industrial Gases Business
Our Industrial Gases business produces atmospheric gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases,
such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide (CO), carbon monoxide, and syngas; and specialty gases. Atmospheric
gases are produced through various air separation processes, of which cryogenic is the most prevalent. Process gases
are produced by methods other than air separation. For example, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas are
produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons.
Hydrogen is produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. Helium
is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs, primarily natural gas, but also CO purified
before resale. The Industrial Gases business also develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or
processing of gases, such as air separation units and non-cryogenic generators.
Our Industrial Gases business is organized and operated regionally. The regional Industrial Gases segments supply
gases, related equipment, and applications in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries, including
those in refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. Hydrogen is used by refiners
to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as
in the developing hydrogen-for-mobility markets. We have hydrogen fueling stations that support commercial markets in
California and Japan as well as demonstration projects in Europe, Saudi Arabia, and other parts of Asia. The chemicals
industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic
chemicals. The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and
oxygen for gasification. Oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications, including in the steel, certain
nonferrous metals, glass, and cement industries. Nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and
preserving flavor, and nitrogen is used for inerting in various fields, including the metals, chemical, and semiconductor
industries. Helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing, purging,
and lifting. Argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting, thermal conductivity, and other
properties. Industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing
processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance.
Industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency with storing
molecules at low temperatures. Helium, however, is generally sourced globally, at long distances from point of sale. As
a result, we maintain an inventory of helium stored in our fleet of ISO containers as well as at the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management underground storage facility in Amarillo, Texas.2

Table of Contents
We distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors
including the customer's volume requirements and location. Our supply modes are as follows:
•Liquid Bulk—Product is delivered in bulk (in liquid or gaseous form) by tanker or tube trailer and stored, usually
in its liquid state, in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a
gaseous state as needed. Liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three- to five-year contracts.
•Packaged Gases—Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars. We operate
packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, our packaged gas business
sells products (principally helium) only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries.
•On-Site Gases—Large quantities of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of
hydrogen and carbon monoxide) are provided to customers, principally in the energy production and refining,
chemical, and metals industries worldwide, that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant
demand. Gases are produced and supplied by large facilities we construct or acquire on or near the customers’
facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities. These sale of gas contracts are
generally governed by 15- to 20-year contracts. We also deliver smaller quantities of product through small on-
site plants (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators), typically via a 10- to 15-year sale of gas contract.
Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Steam methane reformers utilize
natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for
the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. We mitigate electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price
fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through and tolling arrangements. During
fiscal year 2021, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas.
We obtain helium from a number of sources globally, including crude helium for purification from the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management's helium reserve.
The regional Industrial Gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by
the equity method, which we report in our financial statements as income from equity affiliates. The largest of these
joint ventures operate in China, India, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand.
Each of the regional Industrial Gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies: Air Liquide
S.A., Messer, and Linde plc, as well as regional competitors. Competition in Industrial Gases is based primarily on
price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. We derive a competitive advantage in
locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our
larger customers.
Overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 92%, 94%, and 96% of consolidated sales in fiscal
years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 47%, 47%, and 46%
of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while sales of tonnage hydrogen, syngas, and
related products constituted approximately 22%, 22%, and 26% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and
2019, respectively.

Industrial Gases Equipment
We design and manufacture equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas
liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage. The Industrial Gases – Global segment
includes activity primarily related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation. The
equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical
manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. The Corporate and
other segment includes: our LNG equipment business, our Gardner Cryogenics business fabricating helium and
hydrogen transport and storage containers, and our Rotoflow business, which manufactures turboexpanders and other
precision rotating equipment. Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents (compressors, etc.) are the
principal raw materials in the manufacturing of equipment. Raw materials for individual projects typically are acquired
under firm purchase agreements. Equipment is produced at our manufacturing sites with certain components being
procured from subcontractors and vendors. Competition in the equipment business is based primarily on plant
efficiency, service, technical know-how and price, as well as schedule and plant performance guarantees. Sale of
equipment constituted approximately 8%, 6%, and 4% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively.
Our backlog of equipment orders was approximately $1.3 billion on 30 September 2021 (as compared to a total
backlog of approximately $1.6 billion on 30 September 2020). We estimate that approximately half of the total
equipment sales backlog as of 30 September 2021 will be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2022, dependent
on execution schedules of the relevant projects.
International Operations
Through our subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, we conduct business in
53 countries outside the United States. Our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in
foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, tariffs, trade sanctions, and
import and export controls, and other economic, political, and regulatory policies of local governments described in Item
1A, Risk Factors, below.
We have majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada; 18 European countries (including the
Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom); 11 Asian countries (including China, South Korea, and Taiwan); seven
Latin American countries (including Brazil and Chile); six countries in the Middle East (including Saudi Arabia), and
three African countries. We also own less-than-controlling interests in entities operating in Europe, Asia, Latin America,
the Middle East, and Africa (including China, India, Italy, Mexico, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand).
Financial information about our foreign operations and investments is included in Note 7, Summarized Financial
Information of Equity Affiliates; Note 21, Income Taxes; and Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information,
to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, below. Information about foreign currency translation is
included under “Foreign Currency” in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and information on our exposure to currency
fluctuations is included in Note 12, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, included under
Item 8, below, and in “Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk,” included under Item 7A, below.
Technology Development
We pursue a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and development, engineering,
and commercial development processes. We conduct research and development principally in our laboratories located
in the United States (Trexlertown, Pennsylvania), the United Kingdom (Basingstoke and Carrington), Spain
(Barcelona), China (Shanghai), and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran). We also fund and cooperate in research and development
programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others, including the
United States government.
Development of technology for use within the Industrial Gases business focuses primarily on new and improved
processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for
industrial gas products.
During fiscal year 2021, we owned approximately 780 United States patents, approximately 3,480 foreign patents, and
were a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, we
do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent license, or group
of patents or licenses.

Environmental Regulation
We are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and public policies in the countries in which we have
operations. Compliance with these measures often results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal
course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA," the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA"); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation
or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting
Policies, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the
consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below.
Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of
greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including CO. These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission
Trading System, the California Cap-and-Trade Program, China’s Emission Trading Scheme and its nation-wide
expansion, and South Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme. In the Netherlands, a CO emissions tax was enacted on 1
January 2021. In Canada, Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction System went into effect 1 January
2020. In Ontario, Environment & Climate Change Canada’s Output Based Pricing System (“OBPS”) is currently in
effect, however, effective 1 January 2022, Ontario’s GHG Emissions Performance Standards program will be used in
lieu of adherence to the OBPS. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) requires mandatory
reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing
facilities. Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which
often result in higher power costs.
Increased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or
mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to
consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will
be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or
regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our
operations. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our
operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.
Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our
facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency and lower emissions. We see significant
opportunities for gasification, carbon capture technologies and hydrogen for mobility and energy transition.
We estimate that we spent approximately $8 million, $4 million, and $5 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively, on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control
pollution are estimated to be approximately $8 million in both fiscal years 2022 and 2023.
For additional information regarding environmental matters, refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the
consolidated financial statements.
Employees
We believe our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our success as an organization. Our goal is to
be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our
customers. Integral to our success is the continued development of our 4S culture (Safety, Speed, Simplicity and Self-
Confidence) and creating a work environment where our employees feel that they belong and matter. Our talent related
initiatives, including employee recruitment and development, diversity and inclusion and compensation and benefit
programs, are focused on building and retaining the world-class and talented staff that is needed to meet our goals.
On 30 September 2021, we had approximately 20,875 employees, of whom approximately 20,625 were full-time and
approximately 15,575 were located outside the United States. We have collective bargaining agreements with unions
and works councils at certain locations that expire on various dates over the next four years. We consider relations with
our employees to be good.
Our 2021 Sustainability Report details our growth strategy and the role our most valuable asset and our competitive
advantage, our employees, play in achieving our goals. Rooted in our framework of Grow- Conserve- Care, our higher
purpose is to bring people together to collaborate and innovate solutions to the world’s most significant energy and
environmental sustainability challenges. Our 2021 Sustainability Report details how we care for our employees.2

Table of Contents
Safety
Safety is fundamental to who we are as a company. Safety is a shared value, and our employees’ commitment to safety
is demonstrated in many ways every day. Safety is a critical component of everything we do, everywhere in the world.
Our goal is to be the safest industrial gas company in the world.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
Our 2021 Sustainability Report sets forth our announced goals to further increase the percentage of women and U.S.
minorities in professional and managerial roles and the recruitment and talent development strategies we have in place
to ensure we meet these goals. Since the publication of our 2021 Sustainability Report, we have announced goals to
further increase the percentage of women and U.S. minorities in professional and managerial roles. By 2025, we aim to
achieve at least 28 percent female representation in the professional and managerial population globally. Due to
significant increase of our U.S. minority representation, our new 2025 diversity goal is to achieve at least 30 percent
U.S. minority representation in professional and managerial roles. We established these targets following analysis of
our global employee representation metrics and future talent needs, as well as assessing industry benchmarks and
peer companies.
Compensation
As detailed in our 2021 Sustainability Report, in order to create a diverse workplace, individuals must be compensated
fairly and equitably. A work environment where employees know they belong and matter includes fair and equitable pay.
Our pay practices apply equally to all employees irrespective of gender, race, religion, disability, age, or any other form
of personal difference. We strive to pay competitively in local markets where we do business and compete for talent.
We benchmark our compensation to ensure that we are keeping pace with the market to provide competitive pay and
benefits. A gender pay equity analysis completed by a third-party in 2020 resulted in no significant adverse findings for
minorities in the U.S. and for females globally.
We value the contributions of our employees, particularly in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19
pandemic. Many of our employees are on the front line during the pandemic, keeping our plants running and delivering
to our customers the products they need. When possible, employees have been working from home to help maintain
their health and safety as well as business continuity. We have not laid off any of our employees or reduced their
salaries due to COVID-19.
Seasonality
Our businesses are not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any material extent.
Inventories
We maintain limited inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a reasonable delivery
schedule. Inventory consists primarily of crude helium, industrial gas, and specialty gas inventories supplied to
customers through liquid bulk and packaged gases supply modes.
Customers
We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of
our consolidated revenues. We do have concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals,
and electronics. Within each of these industries, we have several large-volume customers with long-term contracts. A
negative trend affecting one of these industries, or the loss of one of these major customers, although not material to
our consolidated revenue, could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
Governmental Contracts
Our business is not subject to a government entity’s renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would be
material to our business as a whole.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. In evaluating investment in the
Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere
from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. Any of these risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to
which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. The
risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to
consider when evaluating our expectations. In addition to such risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties
that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not
currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.
Risks Related to Economic Conditions
The COVID-19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
The COVID-19 global pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and efforts to
reduce its spread have led, and may continue to lead to, significant changes in levels of economic activity and
significant disruption and volatility in global markets. These factors have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced
demand for industrial gas products, particularly in our merchant business. In addition, COVID-19 may result in reduced
sales in our other businesses, lower returns for certain of our projects, and the potential delay or cancellation of certain
projects in our pipeline.
In addition, we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees, including those based at our
headquarters, are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders.
Action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities, recommending other physical
distancing measures, or mandating vaccination against COVID-19 could negatively impact our business and those of
our service providers and customers. Although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place, we cannot
be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time.

Table of Contents
As the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations,
and our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, may be impaired. In addition, we may face unpredictable
increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end. If demand for our
products exceeds our capacity, it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships. Although the
duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time, the decline in economic conditions due to COVID-
19, or another disease-causing similar impacts, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations and such impact may be material.
Further, to the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations and global
economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described
herein.
Changes in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely
affect our results of operations and cash flows.
Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may
decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash
flows.
Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and
markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand
balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past,
including most recently due to COVID-19, and may do so in the future. Reduced demand for our products and services
would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. In addition, reduced demand could depress sales, reduce
our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in
charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors
could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.
In addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic
conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or
adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and
impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated
contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact
our financial results.
Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise
make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or
prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. These or other events associated with weak economic
conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets,
such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a
negative impact on our financial results.
Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal,
and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability.
In fiscal year 2021, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our
operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the United States. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may
be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other
potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing
business abroad. Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between
countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply
disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.

Table of Contents
Our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, particularly in
markets such as China, India, Indonesia, and the Middle East, and involve significantly larger and more complex
projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for
significant economic and political disruptions. We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in
some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our
operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies,
including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions,
inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory
environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting,
training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to
seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. Successful operation of particular facilities or
execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security
concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a
period of time.
Furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, we are exposed
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as
the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal
period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge
the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows,
and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed
discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, below.
Risks Related to Our Business
Operational and project execution risks, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our
operations or financial results.
A significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other large-scale projects that involve
challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years and involve the
investment of billions of dollars. These projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with
government authorities and face significant financing, development, operational and reputational risks. We may
encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment
and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory
permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants,
weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or
transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. In some
cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate
the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of these costs. In addition, in some cases we seek
financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. These
financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could
result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. All of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation
or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to
secure new projects in the future.
The operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous
oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, vehicle
accidents, or cyber incidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the
environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial
results, and cash flows. In addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production
facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and
replace aging assets.

Table of Contents
We are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulations
addressing, among other things, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact
our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
We are subject to government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct
business. The application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and
regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced
profitability. If there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be
subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Compliance with
changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional, unplanned capital
expenditures. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from
some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could
affect the financial results of our businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption
requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-
Unfair Competition Law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred. In
addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we do business that
may prohibit us, or certain of our affiliates, from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business
that we may conduct. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to
comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities.
Further, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts
committed by employees, agents, business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate U.S. and/or
non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false
claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money
laundering, and data privacy. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and
subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could
lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant
legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations
committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
We may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, or effectively disentangle
divested businesses.
Our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify,
successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth,
synergies, and operating efficiencies. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely
basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of
acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to
dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated
liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or
insurance. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations.
We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit
with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and
challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or
otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time
frame or at all. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse
financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. In addition, we have
agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. Our
financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions.

The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to
operate.
We depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as
well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. Our information
technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. If
we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology
infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business
disruptions, property damage, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security
breach. In addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by
computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures,
telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our
system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of our
systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation,
destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees,
partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability.
As with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be
subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the
sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant
impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our
business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, or results of operations. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could:
interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our
customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our
reputation; result in defective products or services, physical damage to facilities, pipelines or delivery systems,
including those we own or operate for third parties, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy
laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and
internal control over financial reporting. Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation
and our financial statements.
Our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers.
The protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. The regulatory environment
surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and
constantly changing requirements. We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and
privacy of this information. We also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to
recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure,
or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers,
including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of
deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information,
which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. These events could also damage our
reputation or otherwise harm our business.
Interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw
material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.
Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and
syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our
business. Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, inflation and energy price
fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or
raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural
events, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and
financial results.
Our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium
suppliers. Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics, supplier operating or transportation
issues, or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers, can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for
processing and resale to customers.
14
Table of Contents
We typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but such cost pass-
through results in declining margins, and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results. For example,
we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such
costs. In addition, increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or
other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price
increases can cause lower sales volume.
New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation.
We are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. Existing technologies are
being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. These technological expansions
can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or
unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or
damage to our reputation. In addition, gasification and other large-scale projects may contain processes or
technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects
generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or
processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. Additionally, there is also a risk that our
new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives. Performance difficulties on these
larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, performance
challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects.
Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm
from infringement on such rights.
As we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party
infringement. We own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services.
As we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive
sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. We may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents
against third-party infringement. It is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Legislative, regulatory, and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk.
We are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur
transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. To
make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which produces
carbon dioxide. In addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and
value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operations are
within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing GHG emissions, including CO, which
may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to
target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.
Increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional
requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Although uncertain, these developments could
increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification
technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack
of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these
measures will have on our operations. Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could
negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.2

Table of Contents
Our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax,
environmental, or other matters.
We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could
become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While we seek to limit our liability in
our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of
liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from
our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably.
Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance
receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates,
such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or
changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular
period.
Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations
and financial results.
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning,
among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and
disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is
a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our
products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional
unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for
environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect our
financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Item 1, Business–Environmental Regulation,
above.
A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense.
The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our
future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of
such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows. Various levels of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increasingly
focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or
foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or
financial condition.
General Risk Factors
Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative
impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.
Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such
as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Any such event could
cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose
us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which
could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our
products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.

Table of Contents
The United Kingdom’s (“UK”) exit from European Union (“EU”) membership could adversely affect our European
Operations.
Although the UK’s exit from EU membership on 31 January 2021 ("Brexit") did not result in material disruptions to
customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, or our European business, the ultimate effects of
Brexit on us are still difficult to predict. Adverse consequences from Brexit may include greater restrictions on imports
and exports between the UK and EU members and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could
adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our European business overall.
Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.
We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our
business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could
weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors’
pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We have not received any written comments from the Commission staff that remain unresolved.
Item 2. Properties.
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. owns its principal administrative offices in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, and the
Company's new global headquarters and co-located research and development facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania, as
well as regional offices in Hersham, England; Medellin, Colombia; and Santiago, Chile. We lease the principal
administrative offices in Shanghai, China; Pune, India; Vadodara, India; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. We lease
administrative offices in the United States, Canada, Spain, Malaysia, and China for our Global Business Support

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings, including
commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and insurance matters.
Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business, such litigation
could result in large monetary awards, especially if compensatory and/or punitive damages are awarded. However, we
believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on
our financial position, earnings, or cash flows.
From time to time, we are also involved in proceedings, investigations, and audits involving governmental authorities in
connection with environmental, health, safety, competition, and tax matters.
We are a party to proceedings under CERCLA, RCRA, and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the
designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has
not been reached where we, along with others, have been designated a potentially responsible party by the
Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at
certain of its current and former manufacturing sites. We do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in
connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
position. Additional information on our environmental exposure is included under Item 1, Business–Environmental
Regulation, and Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
In September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense ("CADE") issued a decision against our
Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged
anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $33 million at 30 September
2021) on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of
Justice, following an investigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale
of industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003.
18
Table of Contents
We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian courts.
On 6 May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda. was dismissed. CADE has
appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending. We, with advice of our outside legal counsel, have assessed the
status of this matter and have concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is
possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial
statements. In the event of an adverse final judgment, we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of
the fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $33 million at 30 September 2021) plus interest accrued thereon until final
disposition of the proceedings.
Additionally, Winter Storm Uri, a severe winter weather storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast in February 2021, disrupted our
operations and caused power and natural gas prices to spike significantly in Texas. We are currently in the early stages
of litigation of a dispute regarding energy management services related to the impact of this unusual event, and other
disputes may arise from such power price increases. In addition, legislative action may affect power supply and energy
management charges. While it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs related to power supply and
energy management services in Texas related to the winter storm, it is too early to estimate potential losses, if any,
given significant unknowns resulting from the unusual nature of this event.
Other than the matters discussed above, we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings, individually or in
the aggregate, that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flows. However, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our
net income in the period in which it is recorded.

from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by
management, including, without limitation, those described in Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors,
of this Annual Report.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes contained in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise stated, financial information is presented in
millions of dollars, except for per share data. Except for net income, which includes the results of discontinued
operations, financial information is presented on a continuing operations basis.
The content of our Management's Discussion and Analysis has been updated pursuant to SEC disclosure
modernization rules that are effective as of the date of this Annual Report. Comparisons of our results of operations and
liquidity and capital resources are for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. For a discussion of changes from fiscal year 2019 to
fiscal year 2020 and other financial information related to fiscal year 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended 30 September 2020. This document was filed with the SEC on 19 November 2020.
The financial measures discussed below are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"), except as noted. We present certain financial measures on an "adjusted," or "non-GAAP," basis

Table of Contents
With operations in over 50 countries, in fiscal year 2021 we had sales of $10.3 billion and assets of $26.9 billion.
Approximately 20,875 passionate, talented, and committed employees from diverse backgrounds are driven by our
higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the
challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.
As of 30 September 2021, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments under which we
managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings:
•Industrial Gases – Americas;
•Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa);
•Industrial Gases – Asia;
•Industrial Gases – Global; and
•Corporate and other
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis discusses our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 23,
Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our
reportable business segments.
On 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 October 2021.
Refer to Note 24, Subsequent Events, for additional information.
2021 IN SUMMAR Y
In fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute our growth strategy, including announcement of several new gasification,
carbon capture, and hydrogen projects that will drive the world’s energy transition from fossil fuels. At the same time,
we remained focused on our base business, delivering consistent results despite external challenges globally and
absorbing costs for additional resources needed to support growth. In the second half of the year, demand for most
merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, we continued to create shareholder value by
increasing the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the
previous dividend. This is the 39 consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.
Fiscal year 2021 results are summarized below:
•Sales of $10.3 billion increased 17%, or $1.5 billion, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to
customers, higher volumes, favorable currency impacts, and positive pricing that more than offset power cost
increases in the second half of the year.
•Operating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, and operating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 basis points
("bp").
•Net income of $2,114.9 increased 10%, or $183.8, and net income margin of 20.5% decreased 130 bp.
•Adjusted EBITDA of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp.
•Diluted EPS of $9.12 increased 7%, or $0.57 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS of $9.02 increased 8%, or $0.64
per share. A summary table of changes in diluted EPS is presented below.th

2022 OUTLOOK
The guidance below should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.
We believe our achievements in 2021 are just the beginning of our journey providing gasification, carbon capture, and
hydrogen for mobility solutions to address the world’s most significant energy and environmental sustainability
challenges. For example, we expect our world-scale Jazan gasification project with Aramco, ACWA Power, and Air
Products Qudra to begin contributing to our results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We expect to continue to
pursue new, high-return opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategy and to add the resources necessary for
project development and execution. We remain committed to creating shareholder value through capital deployment
and delivering increased dividends, as we have done for the past 39 consecutive years.
The duration and extent of ongoing global challenges, such as rising energy costs, energy consumption curtailment,
and supply chain disruptions, remain uncertain. For our merchant business, we plan to continue pricing actions to
recover higher energy costs. We expect to add new projects to our onsite business model, which has contractual
protection from energy cost fluctuations and generates stable cash flow. We expect higher costs from planned
maintenance activities on our facilities in fiscal year 2022 and higher pension expense resulting from lower expected
returns on assets.
Additionally, we expect the Lu’An facility to continue operating under the interim agreement discussed below through
fiscal year 2022.
In fiscal year 2022, we will also continue to focus on our other sustainability goals, including our commitment to reduce
our carbon dioxide emissions intensity and advance diversity and inclusion.
On 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments, including the separation of
our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment into two separate reporting segments: Industrial Gases – Europe and Industrial
Gases – Middle East. The results of an affiliate formerly reflected in the Industrial Gases – Asia segment will now be
reported in the Industrial Gases – Middle East segment. Additionally, the results of our Industrial Gases – Global
operating segment will be reflected in the Corporate and other segment. Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, segment results will be presented on a retrospective basis to reflect the
reorganization.

Table of Contents
Sales of $10,323.0 increased 17%, or $1,466.7, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers
of 6%, higher volumes of 5%, favorable currency impacts of 4%, and positive pricing of 2%. We experienced
significantly higher energy and natural gas costs in the second half of fiscal year 2021, particularly in North America
and Europe. Contractual provisions associated with our on-site business, which represents approximately half our total
company sales, allow us to pass these costs to our customers. Positive volumes from new assets, our sale of
equipment businesses, and merchant demand recovery from COVID-19 were partially offset by reduced contributions
from the Lu'An gasification project discussed below. Favorable currency was primarily driven by the appreciation of the
British Pound Sterling, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, and South Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar. Continued focus on
pricing actions, including energy cost recovery, in our merchant businesses resulted in price improvement in each of
our three regional segments.
Lu’An Clean Energy Company (“Lu’An”), a long-term onsite customer in Asia with which we have a consolidated joint
venture, restarted its facility in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 following successful completion of major
maintenance work in September 2020. Our facility resumed operations, and the joint venture is supplying product at
reduced charges as agreed upon with Lu'An under a short-term agreement reached in the first quarter of fiscal year
2021. As a result of this agreement, we recognized lower revenue in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment in each
quarter of fiscal year 2021. We expect this short-term reduction in charges to extend through fiscal year 2022.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Total cost of sales of $7,209.3, including the facility closure discussed below, increased 23%, or $1,351.2. The increase
from the prior year was primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $479, higher
costs associated with sales volumes of $433, unfavorable currency impacts of $233, and higher costs, including power
and other cost inflation, of $183. Gross margin of 30.2% decreased 370 bp from 33.9% in the prior year, primarily due
to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, higher costs, and the reduced Lu'An contribution,
partially offset by the positive impact of our pricing actions.
Facility Closure
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recorded a charge of $23.2 ($17.4 after-tax, or $0.08 per share) primarily
for a noncash write-down of assets associated with a contract termination in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment.
This charge is reflected as "Facility closure" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30
September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results.
Selling and Administrative
Selling and administrative expense of $828.4 increased 7%, or $52.5, primarily driven by higher spending for business
development resources to support our growth strategy and unfavorable currency impacts. Selling and administrative
expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 8.0% from 8.8% in the prior year.
Research and Development
Research and development expense of $93.5 increased 11%, or $9.6, primarily due to higher product development
costs in our Industrial Gases – Global segment. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.9%
was flat versus the prior year.
Gain on Exchange with Joint Venture Partner
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recognized a gain of $36.8 ($27.3 after-tax, or $0.12 per share) on an
exchange with the Tyczka Group, a former joint venture partner in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. As part of the
exchange, we separated our 50/50 joint venture in Germany into two separate businesses so each party could acquire
a portion of the business on a 100% basis. The gain included $12.7 from the revaluation of our previously held equity
interest in the portion of the business that we retained and $24.1 from the sale of our equity interest in the remaining
business. The gain is reflected as "Gain on exchange with joint venture partner" on our consolidated income
statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 3,
Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Company Headquarters Relocation Income (Expense)
In anticipation of relocating our U.S. headquarters, we sold property at our corporate headquarters located in
Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. We received net proceeds of $44.1 and recorded
a gain of $33.8 ($25.6 after-tax, or $0.12 per share), which is reflected on our consolidated income statements as
"Company headquarters relocation income (expense)" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020. The gain was not
recorded in the results of the Corporate and other segment.
26
Table of Contents
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income of $52.8 decreased 19%, or $12.6. The prior year was favorably impacted by an adjustment for a benefit
plan liability due to a change in plan terms. This impact was partially offset by the settlement of a supply contract in the
current year.
Operating Income and Margin
Operating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, as favorable currency of $96, positive pricing, net of power and
fuel costs, of $95, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner of $37 were partially offset by higher
operating costs of $127, prior year income associated with the company headquarters relocation of $34, and a facility
closure of $23. Despite higher sales volumes, the volume impact on operating income was minimal due to reduced
contributions from Lu'An. Unfavorable operating costs were driven by the addition of resources to support our growth
strategy and higher planned maintenance activities.
Operating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 bp from 25.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher operating costs,
higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which contributed to sales but not operating income,
and reduced contributions from Lu'An, partially offset by positive pricing. The positive impact from a gain on an
exchange with a joint venture partner in the current year was offset by prior year income associated with the company
headquarters relocation.
Equity Affiliates’ Income
Equity affiliates' income of $294.1 increased 11%, or $29.3. Higher income from affiliates in the regional segments was
partially offset by a prior year benefit of $33.8 from the enactment of the India Finance Act 2020. Refer to Note 21,
Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
We expect our equity affiliates' income to grow in future periods due to our investment in the Jazan Integrated
Gasification and Power Company joint venture.
Interest Expense
Fiscal Year Ended 30 September 2021 2020
Interest incurred $170.1 $125.2 
Less: Capitalized interest 28.3 15.9 
Interest expense $141.8 $109.3 
Interest incurred increased 36%, or $44.9, primarily driven by a higher debt balance due to the issuance of U.S. Dollar-
and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Capitalized interest increased $12.4 due
to a higher carrying value of projects under construction.
Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net
Other non-operating income of $73.7 increased $43.0. We recorded higher non-service pension income in 2021 due to
lower interest costs and higher total assets, primarily for our U.S. pension plans. The current year also included
favorable currency impacts. These factors were partially offset by lower interest income on cash and cash items due to
lower interest rates.
Discontinued Operations
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $70.3 ($0.32 per share) for the fiscal year ended 30 September
2021. This included net tax benefits of $60.0 recorded for the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, of
which $51.8 ($0.23 per share) was recorded in the fourth quarter for liabilities associated with the 2017 sale of our
former Performance Materials Division ("PMD") and $8.2 was recorded in the third quarter for liabilities associated with
our former Energy-from-Waste business. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit from discontinued operations of $10.3
in the first quarter, primarily from the settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of PMD.
In fiscal year 2020, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $14.3 ($0.06 per share). This resulted from a pre-
tax loss of $19.0 recorded in the second quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental obligations
associated with the sale of our former Amines business in September 2006. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note
16, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information.
27
Table of Contents
Net Income and Net Income Margin
Net income of $2,114.9, including income from discontinued operations discussed above, increased 10%, or $183.8.
On a continuing operations basis, the increase was primarily driven by positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs,
favorable currency impacts, higher equity affiliates' income, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner,
partially offset by unfavorable operating costs and a loss from a facility closure. In addition, less net income was
attributable to noncontrolling interests, including our Lu'An joint venture partner, in the current year. The prior year
included income associated with the company headquarters relocation and a net benefit from the India Finance Act
2020.
Net income margin of 20.5% decreased 130 bp from 21.8% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural
gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable net operating
costs, partially offset by the impact from our pricing actions.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
Adjusted EBITDA of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, primarily due to favorable currency impacts, positive pricing,
net of power and fuel costs, and higher equity affiliates' income, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs. Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp from 40.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural
gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 200 bp, and the unfavorable net
operating costs.
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate was 18.5% and 19.7% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
current year rate was lower primarily due to income tax benefits of $21.5 recorded upon expiration of the statute of
limitations for tax reserves previously established for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years. This included a benefit
of $12.2 ($0.05 per share) for release of reserves established in 2017 for a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary
and other previously disclosed items ("tax election benefit and other"). Refer to Note 21 Income Taxes, to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Additionally, the fiscal year 2020 effective tax rate reflected the unfavorable impact of India Finance Act 2020, which
resulted in additional net income of $13.5 ($0.06 per share). This included an increase to equity affiliates' income of
$33.8, partially offset by an increase to our income tax provision of $20.3 for changes in the future tax costs of
repatriated earnings.
The adjusted effective tax rate was 18.9% and 19.1% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

Table of Contents
Sales of $4,167.6 increased 15%, or $536.9, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of
11% and positive pricing of 4%, as volumes and currency were flat versus the prior year. Energy and natural gas cost
pass through to customers was higher in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to natural gas prices, which rose significantly in
the second quarter and remained elevated throughout the year. The pricing improvement was attributable to continued
focus on pricing actions in our merchant business. Volumes were flat as positive contributions from new assets,
including hydrogen assets we acquired in April 2020, were offset by lower hydrogen and merchant demand. Demand
for most merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2021.
Operating income of $1,065.5 increased 5%, or $53.1, due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $79 and
favorable currency of $10, partially offset by higher operating costs, including planned maintenance, of $36. Operating
margin of 25.6% decreased 230 bp from 27.9% in the prior year primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost
pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 250 bp, and higher operating costs,
partially offset by the impact of our pricing actions.
Equity affiliates’ income of $112.5 increased 33%, or $28.2, primarily driven by higher income from affiliates in Mexico.

Sales of $2,444.9 increased 27%, or $518.6, due to higher volumes of 12%, favorable currency impacts of 7%, higher
energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 5%, and positive pricing of 3%. The volume improvement
was primarily driven by our base merchant business and new assets, including those from a business in Israel that we
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. While our liquid bulk business has largely recovered from COVID-19, demand for
packaged gases and hydrogen continues to be lower than pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency impacts were
primarily driven by the appreciation of the British Pound Sterling and Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Energy and natural
gas cost pass-through to customers was higher primarily in the second half of the year as we experienced significantly
higher natural gas and electricity costs in Europe. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to our merchant
business.
Operating income of $557.4 increased 18%, or $84.1, due to higher volumes of $59, favorable currency impacts of $31,
and positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $11, partially offset by unfavorable costs of $17. Operating margin
of 22.8% decreased 180 bp from 24.6% in the prior year, primarily due to impacts from higher energy and natural gas
cost pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable
operating costs.
Equity affiliates’ income of $93.7 increased 25%, or $18.9, primarily due to higher income from affiliates in Italy, Saudi
Arabia, and South Africa.

Total Industrial Gases – Asia Sales Change 8 %
Sales of $2,920.8 increased 8%, or $204.3, due to favorable currency of 7% and positive pricing of 1%, as both
volumes and energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers were flat. Positive volume contributions from our
base merchant business and new plants were offset by reduced contributions from Lu'An. The favorable currency
impact was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Chinese Renminbi and South Korean Won against the U.S.
Dollar.
Operating income of $838.3 decreased 4%, or $32.0, primarily due to unfavorable volume mix of $62 and higher
operating costs, including inflation and product sourcing costs, of $32, partially offset by favorable currency of
$59. Operating margin of 28.7% decreased 330 bp from 32.0% in the prior year primarily due to reduced contributions
from Lu'An.
Equity affiliates’ income of $81.4 increased 33%, or $20.4, primarily due to higher income from an affiliate in India.

Sales of $511.0 increased 40%, or $146.1, due to higher sale of equipment project activity. Despite higher sales,
operating loss of $60.6 increased 52%, or $20.6, as higher project costs and product development spending were
partially offset by income from the settlement of a supply contract.

Sales of $278.7 increased 28%, or $60.8, primarily due to higher project activity in our distribution sale of equipment
and turbo machinery equipment and services businesses. Despite higher sales, operating loss of $132.8 increased
18%, or $20.6, as higher business development and corporate support costs were only partially offset by higher sale of

RECONCILIA TIONS OF NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL  MEASURES
(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)
We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"), on an "adjusted" or "non-GAAP" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted
earnings per share ("EPS"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital
expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition
to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand
the impact that certain disclosed items, or "non-GAAP adjustments," have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted
EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial
measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly
comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide
investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our
business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP,
provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and
projected future results.
In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP
measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business
performance. For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions,
impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar
losses or gains in the future. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial
measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.
When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred
income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the
various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.

Adjusted Diluted EPS
The table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major
components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance
metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per
share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating
underlying business performance. The per share impact for each non-GAAP adjustment was calculated independently
and may not sum to total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding
non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest
expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization
expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating
performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for
the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding.

Capital Expenditures
We define capital expenditures as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, acquisitions (less cash acquired),
and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. A reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our
reported capital expenditures is provided below:
Fiscal Year Ended 30 September 2021 2020
Cash used for investing activities $2,732.9 $3,560.0 
Proceeds from sale of assets and investments 37.5 80.3 
Purchases of investments (2,100.7) (2,865.5)
Proceeds from investments 1,875.2 1,938.0 
Other investing activities 5.8 3.9 
Capital expenditures $2,550.7 $2,716.7 
LIQUIDITY  AND CAPIT AL RESOURCES
Our cash balance and cash flows from operations are our primary sources of liquidity and are generally sufficient to
meet our liquidity needs. In addition, we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities,
including accessing the capital markets, drawing upon our credit facility, or alternatively, accessing the commercial
paper markets. At this time, we have not utilized, nor do we expect to access, our credit facility for additional liquidity. In
addition, we have considered the impacts of COVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources and do not expect it to
impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.
As of 30 September 2021, we had $1,590.4 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of
$4,468.9. We do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be
subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and
affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However,
since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority
of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S.
Cash Flows From Operations
Fiscal Year Ended 30 September 2021 2020
Income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products $2,028.8 $1,901.0

Other adjustments (116.7) 116.4 
Changes in working capital accounts 16.7 (40.1)
Cash Provided by Operating Activities $3,335.2 $3,264.7 
For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $3,335.2. Other adjustments of
$116.7 included pension plan contributions of $44.6 and pension income of $38.9 that did not have a cash impact. The
working capital accounts were a source of cash of $16.7, primarily driven by a $187.9 source of cash from payables
and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $130.5 use of cash from trade receivables, less allowances. The source of
cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs, which also drove the use of
cash within trade receivables as we contractually passed through these higher costs to customers.
36
Table of Contents
For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $3,264.7. We recorded a net
benefit of $13.5 on our consolidated income statements related to a recently enacted tax law in India during the second
quarter. This net benefit, which is further discussed in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements,
increased "Undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates" by $33.8 and increased "Deferred income taxes" by
$20.3. The "Gain on sale of assets and investments" of $45.8 includes a gain of $33.8 related to the sale of property at
our current corporate headquarters. Refer to Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $40.1, primarily driven by
other working capital uses of $130.6, partially offset by a source of $84.4 from other receivables. The use of cash within
"Other working capital" was primarily due to timing of tax payments and a tax benefit as a result of the assets acquired
in April 2020 from PBF Energy Inc. The source of cash within "Other receivables" was primarily driven by maturities of
forward exchange contracts.
Cash Flows From Investing Activities

Cash Used for Investing Activities ($2,732.9)($3,560.0)
For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash used for investing activities was $2,732.9. Capital expenditures for
plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,464.2. Purchases of investments with terms greater than
three months but less than one year of $2,100.7 exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,875.2, which resulted from
maturities of time deposits and treasury securities.
For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash used for investing activities was $3,560.0. Payments for additions
to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,509.0. This includes the acquisition of five operating
hydrogen production plants from PBF Energy Inc. in Delaware and California for approximately $580. Additionally,
acquisitions, less cash acquired, includes $183.3 for three businesses we acquired on 1 July 2020, the largest of which
was a business in Israel that primarily offers merchant gas products. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information. Purchases of investments of $2,865.5 related to time deposits and
treasury securities with terms greater than three months and less than one year and exceeded proceeds from
investments of $1,938.0. Proceeds from sale of assets and investments of $80.3 included net proceeds of $44.1 related
to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and
equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to
unconsolidated affiliates. The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below. We present a
reconciliation of our capital expenditures to cash used for investing activities on page 36.
Fiscal Year Ended 30 September 2021 2020
Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits $2,464.2 $2,509.0 
Acquisitions, less cash acquired 10.5 183.3 
Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 76.0 24.4 
Capital Expenditures $2,550.7 $2,716.7 
Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 totaled $2,550.7 compared to $2,716.7 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease of
$166.0 was primarily driven by the prior year acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from PBF, partially
offset by lower spending for acquisitions. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine,
ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements.
37
Table of Contents
Outlook for Investing Activities
We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $4.5 to $5 billion. In the first quarter of fiscal
year 2022, we paid $1.6 billion, including approximately $130 from a non-controlling partner in one of our subsidiaries,
for the initial investment in the Jazan gasification and power project. We expect to make an additional investment of
approximately $1 billion, which includes contribution from our non-controlling partner, for phase II of the project in 2023.
Refer to Note 24, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for
investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is
driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either
individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.
We anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from
continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized
industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas
facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial
gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for
more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.

In fiscal year 2021, cash used for financing activities was $1,420.9 and primarily included dividend payments to
shareholders of $1,256.7 and payments on long-term debt of $462.9, partially offset by long-term debt proceeds of
$178.9 and investments by noncontrolling interests of $136.6. The payments on long-term debt included the repayment
of a €350.0 million Eurobond ($428) in June 2021.
In November 2021, we repaid our 3.0% Senior Note of $400, plus interest, on its maturity date.
In fiscal year 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $3,284.7 as we successfully accessed the debt markets in
April 2020 to support opportunities for growth projects and repay upcoming debt maturities. Long-term debt proceeds of
$4,895.8 were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,103.6 and payments on long-term debt of
$406.6 primarily related to the repayment of a 2.0% Eurobond of €300.0 million ($353.9) that matured on 7 August
2020. Other financing activities were a use of cash of $97.2 and included financing charges associated with the third
quarter debt issuance.
Financing and Capital Structure
Capital needs in fiscal year 2021 were satisfied with cash from operations. Total debt decreased from $7,907.8 as of 30
September 2020 to $7,637.2 as of 30 September 2021, primarily due to repayment of the €350 million Eurobond,
partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings on our foreign commitments. Total debt includes related party
debt of $358.4 and $338.5 as of 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020, respectively, primarily associated with
the Lu'An joint venture. For additional detail, refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements.

On 31 March 2021, we entered into a five-year $2,500 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2021
Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2021
Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. The only financial
covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to capitalization (equal to total debt plus total
equity) not to exceed 70%. Total debt as of 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020, expressed as a percentage of
total capitalization, was 35.2% and 38.9%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit
Agreement as of 30 September 2021.
The 2021 Credit Agreement replaced our previous five-year $2,300.0 revolving credit agreement, which was to have
matured on 31 March 2022. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement as of 30 September 2020
or at the time of its termination. No early termination penalties were incurred.
Commitments of $296.7 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, $176.2 of which was borrowed and outstanding as
of 30 September 2021.
As of 30 September 2021, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt
agreements.
On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common
stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares in fiscal years 2021 or 2020. As of 30 September 2021,
$485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.
Dividends
Cash dividends on our common stock are paid quarterly, usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal
quarter. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future at comparable or increased levels.
The Board of Directors determines whether to declare dividends and the timing and amount based on financial
condition and other factors it deems relevant. In 2021, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on our
common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the previous dividend of $1.34 per share. This is
the 39 consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.
On 18 November 2021, the Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2022 dividend of $1.50 per share. The dividend
is payable on 14 February 2022 to shareholders of record as of 3 January 2022.
Discontinued Operations
In fiscal year 2021, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $6.7 resulted from cash received
as part of a state tax settlement related to the sale of PMD in fiscal year 2017.
PENSION BENEFITS
We and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a
substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried
pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined
contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to
reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.
The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2021 measurement
date increased to $5,248.7 from $4,775.1 at the end of fiscal year 2020. The projected benefit obligation for these plans
was $5,304.9 and $5,373.5 at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net unfunded liability decreased
$542.2 from $598.4 to $56.2, primarily due to favorable asset experience. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the
consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.th

Pension Expense
2021 2020
Pension (income)/expense, including special items noted below ($37.3) $7.0 
Settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments ("special items") 1.8 5.2 
Weighted average discount rate – Service cost 2.3 % 2.4 %
Weighted average discount rate – Interest cost 1.8 % 2.3 %
Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 6.0 % 6.3 %
Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.4 % 3.4 %
We recognized pension income of $37.3 in fiscal year 2021 versus expense of $7.0 in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to
lower interest cost and higher total assets. Special items decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension
settlement losses.
2022 Outlook
In fiscal year 2022, we expect pension impacts to range from $5 million of income to $5 million of expense, which
includes potential settlement losses of $5 to $10 million, depending on the timing of retirements. This forecast reflects a
lower expected estimated return on assets due to the increased percentage of fixed income investments within the plan
asset portfolios and higher interest cost, partially offset by lower forecasted actuarial loss amortization. In fiscal year
2022, our expected range of pension impacts includes approximately $80 for amortization of actuarial losses.
In fiscal year 2021, pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $97.8. Net actuarial gains of $360.8
were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2021. Actuarial gains and losses are
amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses.
Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and
resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2022.
Pension Funding
Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are
primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with
appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.
In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from
tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities
and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2021 and 2020, our cash
contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $44.6 and $37.5, respectively.
For fiscal year 2022, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $40 to $50. The estimate is based
on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are
dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount
rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. We do not expect COVID-19 to impact our
contribution forecast for fiscal year 2022.

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMA TES
Refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial
statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of
new accounting guidance.
The accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding
our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as
the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates
reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on
information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. If conditions change, actual results may
differ materially from these estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates
and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.
Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment
Plant and equipment, net at 30 September 2021 totaled $13,254.6, and depreciation expense totaled $1,284.1 during
fiscal year 2021. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which
deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.
Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less
than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated
economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive
position, raw material availability, and geographic location.
The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business
circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products,
excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than
originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated
remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated
useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective
basis.
The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an
on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20
years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the
contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As
contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new
contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.
Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller
customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally
15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on
future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc.
In addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business
combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the
remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar
assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances
change.

Impairment of Assets
As discussed below, there were no triggering events in fiscal year 2021 that would require impairment testing for any of
our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles assets, or equity method investments.
We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded there
were no indications of impairment.
Impairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment
Plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the
occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-
imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest
level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances
would include: (1) a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping; (2) a significant adverse
change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition; (3) an accumulation of
costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset;
(4) a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary; (5) a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with
the use of the asset grouping; or (6) changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.
If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset
group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be
impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An
estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.
The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment.
Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to
produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates
at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with
multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could
result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews
and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.
In fiscal year 2021, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in
circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable.
Impairment of Assets – Goodwill
The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments
to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and
previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity.
Goodwill was $911.5 as of 30 September 2021. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 9, Goodwill, to the
consolidated financial statements.
We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting
unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial
information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five
reportable business segments, seven operating segments and ten reporting units, seven of which include a goodwill
balance. Refer to Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting units
are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is
assigned to reporting units within our regional Industrial Gases segments.
As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it
is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we choose to
bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting
unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
42
Table of Contents
To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the
present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit
trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-
term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The
principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit
and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit
and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts
and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-
participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return,
cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and
where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates.
If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the
market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is
estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases
companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting
unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are
utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper
weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model,
and actual results could differ from the estimates.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, noting no indications of
impairment. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.
Due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 October 2021, we conducted an additional impairment test
on our existing reporting units as of 30 September 2021. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially
exceeded their carrying value at 30 September 2021.
Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting
units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability
to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the
reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of
assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment
charges.
Impairment of Assets – Intangible Assets
Intangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2021 totaled $380.4 and consisted primarily of customer
relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for
impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
See the impairment discussion above under "Impairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment" for a description of how
impairment losses are determined.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2021 totaled $40.3 and consisted of trade names and trademarks.
Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets
involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying
value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair
value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by
estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.
Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 10, Intangible Assets, to the
consolidated financial statements.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in
no impairment.

Impairment of Assets – Equity Method Investments
Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,649.3 at 30 September 2021. The majority of our
investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized
financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 7, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to
the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying
value of an investment occurs. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach
and/or market approach. We utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee
under the income approach. For the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from
comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of
an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.
In fiscal year 2021, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment, as no events or
changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.
Revenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input Method
Revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment
for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with
alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to
total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs
incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer
of control to the customer.
Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing
risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the
potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, labor productivity, the
complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When
adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated
profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When
estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the
entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction
activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Industrial Gases – Global segment require monitoring of risks
associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total
revenues and total costs to complete the contract.
Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating
income by approximately $19 in fiscal year 2021 as compared to a favorable impact of $7 in fiscal year 2020. Our
changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.
We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or
negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.
Revenue Recognition – On-site Customer Contracts
For customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-
term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these
on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements,
variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of
revenue recognition.

Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. As of 30 September 2021, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $251.0,
and net deferred tax liabilities were $1,080.7. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2021
were $140.3, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 was
$462.8. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial
statements.
Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred
tax assets.
Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of
operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax
returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.
Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect
sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards,
these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the
weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will
not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and
available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid
the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax
expense.
A 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of
approximately $25.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are
determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on
the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans.
Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These
models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively
consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.
Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the
plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of
compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of
these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use
assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based
on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable.
However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences
in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover.
One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate
reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the
expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the
service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the
relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit
obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that
affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in
lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to
pension expense, respectively, of approximately $20 per year.
45
Table of Contents
The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned
by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account
historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate
environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the
asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result
in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a
decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $23 per year.
We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension
plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The
expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. This is a calculated value
that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and
reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value.
Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.
The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the
underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as
comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an
increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $7 per year.
Loss Contingencies
In the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as
to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible
loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better
estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is
discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in
Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to
determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably
estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional
information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates
associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an
accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to
environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the
scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the
liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have
a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates
and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in
currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.
We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into
transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All
instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative
instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Financial
Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through
our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.
Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts
owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward
contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the "net financial
instrument position" and is disclosed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements.
46
Table of Contents
Our net financial instrument position decreased from a liability of $8,220.7 at 30 September 2020 to a liability of
$7,850.3 at 30 September 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of a €350.0 million Eurobond ($428)
on its maturity date in June 2021.
The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in
market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates
and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-
party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on
market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied
volatilities.
Interest Rate Risk
Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2021 and 2020, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap
agreements, was composed of 89% fixed-rate debt and 11% variable-rate debt.
The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an
instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2021, with all other variables held
constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $587 and $711 in the net liability
position of financial instruments at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest
rates would result in an increase of $692 and $846 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September
2021 and 2020, respectively.
Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp
increase in interest rates would result in an additional $8 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2021 and 2020.
A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $8 per year at 30 September 2021 and 2020.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
The sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the
foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2021 and 2020, with all other variables held
constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would
result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $343 and $360 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30
September 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese
Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward
contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-
forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign
currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial
instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the
opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.
The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States.
Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro
represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the
Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $45
and $25, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL  CONTROL  OVER FINANCIAL  REPORTING
Air Products’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting, which is defined in the following sentences, is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that:
(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii)provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and
(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance and
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our processes contain self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are
taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.
Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of 30 September 2021, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2021 as stated in its report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries
(the "Company") as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive
income statements, statements of equity, and statements of cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on
the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing
a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition – On-site Customer Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
On-site industrial gas customer contracts involve large capital investments to serve customers who require large
volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. The Company builds, owns and operates facilities on or near
the customer’s facilities to produce and supply the customer with gases under a long-term arrangement. Typically,
these contracts have 15- to 20-year terms and contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements.
Revenue associated with these contracts is generally recognized over time during the period in which the Company
delivers or makes available the agreed upon quantity of gases. In addition, certain on-site industrial gas contracts
contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, pricing
provisions, and variable components that are specific to a customer arrangement, including certain contracts with
related parties. These arrangements may require greater judgment in determining when contractual requirements have
been met, impacting the timing and amount of revenue to be recorded.
We identified revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex terms and
provisions as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to evaluate these contract
terms, including amendments, when determining the amount of revenue to be recognized. This required a high degree
of auditor judgment when performing procedures to audit management’s identification and assessment of contract
terms when determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition and evaluating the results of those procedures.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex
terms and provisions included the following procedures, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition,
including controls over the evaluation of complex terms and provisions in certain on-site industrial gas
customer contracts.
•We evaluated the terms included within original customer contracts and related amendments to assess the
accounting for provisions such as minimum payment requirements, pricing provisions, settlement terms, and
variable components that require management to apply judgment in determining revenue recognition
associated with the contract.
•We tested the probability of collection of variable components, including penalties, which impacts the amount
and timing of revenue which the Company expects to collect.
•We inquired of personnel who oversee operations, customer relations, and revenue recognition as to the
presence of contract amendments, and interpretation of contract terms.
•We considered the nature of transactions with related parties and any potential impact on revenue recognition.
•We evaluated customer transactions and agreed the amount of revenue recognized to underlying contracts,
customer invoices, and cash receipts.
•We considered customer payment history, subsequent events, write-offs of customer receivables, collectability,
modification of contract terms, and other factors that could impact the amount and timing of revenue
recognition.

Revenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input Method – Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company enters into sale of equipment contracts with customers for which the promised goods or services
contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services for a single output to the
customer. Revenue from the sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as the Company has an
enforceable right to payment for performance, as completed, and performance under the contract terms does not
create an asset with an alternative use. The Company uses a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by
which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward
satisfying performance obligations.
Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires a high degree of judgment to estimate total
costs used to recognize revenue. Changes in estimated costs could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue
recognition. Auditing these estimates requires extensive audit effort due to the complexity around the cost estimation
process which involves multiple inputs and variables for sale of equipment contracts and a high degree of auditor
judgment when evaluating the results of those procedures.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to complex contracts with customers for sales of equipment included the following, among
others:
•We tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition
for sale of equipment contracts, including controls over developing the estimated costs at completion and the
evaluation of changes in estimated total costs for sale of equipment contracts.
•We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the methods and assumptions used by management to
evaluate estimated total costs and changes in estimated costs to determine if the estimated total costs at
completion for sale of equipment contracts were reasonable.
•With the assistance of our professionals having expertise in accounting for sale of equipment contracts, we
performed the following:
◦Evaluated management’s ability to estimate total costs at completion for each selected contract by
performing corroborating inquiries with the Company’s project managers and personnel involved with
the selected contracts, including inquiries related to the timeline for completion and estimates of future
costs to complete the contract.
◦Selected a sample of estimates of future costs to complete and evaluated management’s estimates of
total costs at completion by performing one of the following:
▪Comparing management’s estimates to documents such as work plans, customer purchase
orders, third-party supplier invoices, and subcontractor agreements, or
▪Developing independent estimates of total costs to completion and comparing our estimates to
management’s estimates. Our independent estimates were based on information such as work
plans, customer purchase orders, third-party supplier invoices, subcontractor agreements, and
similar historical project experience.
◦We compared the gross margin on sale of equipment contracts to that of historical periods in order to
evaluate the Company's ability to accurately estimate costs at completion.

1.  MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Principles
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. were prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Air
Products and Chemicals, Inc. and those of its controlled subsidiaries (“we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” “Air Products,”
or “registrant”), which are generally majority owned. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in
consolidation.
We consolidate all entities that we control. The general condition for control is ownership of a majority of the voting
interests of an entity. Control may also exist in arrangements where we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity ("VIE"). An entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic
performance of a VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits significant to the VIE is considered the
primary beneficiary of that entity. We have determined that we are not a primary beneficiary of any material VIE.
The notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated, are on a continuing operations basis.
The results of operations and cash flows for our discontinued operations have been segregated from the results of
continuing operations and segment results. The comprehensive income related to discontinued operations has not
been segregated and is included in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. There were no assets and
liabilities presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5, Discontinued
Operations, for additional information.
Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2021 presentation.
Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
COVID-19 Risks and Uncertainties
COVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, continues to
impact our business operations and results. There continue to be many unknowns regarding the pandemic, including
the ongoing spread and severity of the virus and the pace of vaccine rollouts globally. Given the dynamic nature of
these circumstances, uncertainty remains related to how the pandemic may affect our business, results of operations,
and overall financial performance.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied, which occurs when control is transferred to
the customer.
We determine the transaction price of our contracts based on the amount of consideration to which we expect to be
entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. Our contracts within the scope of revenue guidance
do not contain payment terms that include a significant financing component.
Sales returns and allowances are not a business practice in the industry.
Our sale of gas contracts are either accounted for over time during the period in which we deliver or make available the
agreed upon quantity of goods or at a point in time when the customer receives and obtains control of the product,
which generally occurs upon delivery. We generally recognize revenue from our sale of gas contracts based on the
right to invoice practical expedient.
Our sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation as the individual promised
goods or services contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services in the
contract for a single output to the customer. Revenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over
time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the
contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We recognize these contracts using a cost incurred input
method by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress
toward satisfying performance obligations.
59
Table of Contents
Amounts billed for shipping and handling fees are classified as sales in the consolidated income statements. Shipping
and handling activities for our sale of equipment contracts may be performed after the customer obtains control of the
promised goods. In these cases, we have elected to apply the practical expedient to account for shipping and handling
as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. For our sale of gas contracts, control generally transfers to the
customer upon delivery.
Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes
imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated
income statements.
For additional information, refer to Note 4, Revenue Recognition.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales predominantly represents the cost of tangible products sold. These costs include labor, raw materials,
plant engineering, power, depreciation, production supplies and materials packaging costs, and maintenance costs.
Costs incurred for shipping and handling are also included in cost of sales.
Depreciation
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from
earnings every year over its expected economic useful life. The principal lives for major classes of plant and equipment
are summarized in Note 8, Plant and Equipment, net.
Selling and Administrative
The principal components of selling and administrative expenses are compensation, advertising, and promotional
costs.
Postemployment Benefits
We provide termination benefits to employees as part of ongoing benefit arrangements and record a liability for
termination benefits when probable and estimable. These criteria are met when management, with the appropriate level
of authority, approves and commits to its plan of action for termination; the plan identifies the employees to be
terminated and their related benefits; and the plan is to be completed within one year. We do not provide material one-
time benefit arrangements.
Fair Value Measurements
We are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial measurement or for
subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, fair value is used in the initial measurement of assets and liabilities
acquired in a business combination; on a recurring basis in the measurement of derivative financial instruments; and on
a nonrecurring basis when long-lived assets are written down to fair value when held for sale or determined to be
impaired. Refer to Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, and Note 15, Retirement Benefits, for information on the
methods and assumptions used in our fair value measurements.
Financial Instruments
We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of
derivative financial instruments. The types of derivative financial instruments permitted for such risk management
programs are specified in policies set by management. Refer to Note 12, Financial Instruments, for further detail on the
types and use of derivative instruments into which we enter.
Major financial institutions are counterparties to all of these derivative contracts. We have established counterparty
credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better.
Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote, and any losses would be immaterial to
the consolidated financial results, financial condition, or liquidity.
We recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, we
generally designate the derivative as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to
be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), (2) a hedge of a net investment in a
foreign operation (net investment hedge), or (3) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value
hedge).
60
Table of Contents
The following details the accounting treatment of our cash flow, fair value, net investment, and non-designated hedges:
•Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets the cash flow hedge criteria are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") to the extent effective and then recognized in
earnings when the hedged items affect earnings.
•Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair value
hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are
recorded in current period earnings.
•Changes in the fair value of a derivative and foreign currency debt that are designated as and meet all the
required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are recorded as translation adjustments in AOCL.
•Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in
earnings.
We formally document the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating
derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, at the inception of the hedge and
on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the
hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a
highly effective hedge, we will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
Foreign Currency
Since we do business in many foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our financial position
and results of operations.
In most of our foreign operations, the local currency is considered the functional currency. Foreign subsidiaries
translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date.
The gains or losses that result from this process are shown as translation adjustments in AOCL in the equity section of
the balance sheet.
The revenue and expense accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange
rates that prevail during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of these items on the consolidated income
statements fluctuates from period to period, depending on the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Some
transactions are made in currencies different from an entity’s functional currency. Gains and losses from these foreign
currency transactions, and the impact of related hedges, are generally reflected in "Other income (expense), net" on
our consolidated income statements as they occur and were not material for the periods presented.
Foreign exchange gains and losses from the foreign currency remeasurement of balances associated with
intercompany and third-party financing transactions, related income tax assets and liabilities, and the impact of related
hedges are reflected within “Other non-operating income (expense), net" and were not material for the periods
presented.
In addition, foreign currency forward points and currency swap basis differences that are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness of our cash flow hedges of intercompany loans (“excluded components”) are
recorded within “Other non-operating income (expense), net" on a straight-line basis. Excluded components were
expenses of $31.0, $33.5, and $33.3 in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In 2019, excluded components
were recorded in “Interest expense” and were not restated upon adoption of accounting guidance in fiscal year 2020 on
hedging activities.

Environmental Expenditures
Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Remediation costs are capitalized if the costs improve our property as
compared with the condition of the property when originally constructed or acquired, or if the costs prevent
environmental contamination from future operations. We expense environmental costs related to existing conditions
resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible. The amounts
charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $18.6, $18.3, and $14.2 in fiscal
years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax expense of $19.0 in results from
discontinued operations to increase our environmental accrual for the Pace facility in the second quarter of fiscal year
2020. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information.
The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available information with respect
to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and
prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated
site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing
costs, remediation costs, post-remediation monitoring costs, natural resource damages, and outside legal fees. These
liabilities include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that we have reason to believe such
parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. They do not consider any claims for recoveries from insurance or
other parties and are not discounted.
As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amount of projected cost is reviewed and the liability
is adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Management has an established
process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. An environmental accrual analysis is prepared
and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies, even where an accrual has not been established. This
analysis assists in monitoring our overall environmental exposure and serves as a tool to facilitate ongoing
communication among our technical experts, environmental managers, environmental lawyers, and financial
management to ensure that required accruals are recorded and potential exposures disclosed.
Given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures, actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in
future periods may vary from the estimates. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional
information on our environmental loss contingencies.
The accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily as part of other
noncurrent liabilities.
Litigation
In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of
possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a
better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a
litigation loss contingency includes estimates of potential damages and other directly related costs expected to be
incurred. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information on our current legal
proceedings.
Share-Based Compensation
We expense the grant-date fair value of our share-based awards over the vesting period during which employees
perform related services. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the
requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement. Refer to Note 18, Share-Based Compensation, for additional
information regarding these awards and the models and assumptions used to determine the grant-date fair value of our
awards.
62
Table of Contents
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
A principal temporary difference results from the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation because
accelerated methods of depreciation and shorter useful lives are used for income tax purposes. The cumulative impact
of a change in tax rates or regulations is included in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances to the extent we believe that these assets are
more likely than not to be realized considering all available evidence.
A tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination based on its technical merits. This position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as
a component of income tax expense. For additional information regarding our income taxes, refer to Note 21, Income
Taxes.
Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), net
Other non-operating income (expense), net includes interest income associated with our cash and cash items and
short-term investments, certain foreign currency remeasurements and impacts from the related hedging activities
discussed in the Foreign Currency section above, and non-service cost components of net periodic pension and
postretirement benefit cost. Our non-service costs primarily include interest cost, expected return on plan assets,
amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and settlements.
Cash and Cash Items
Cash and cash items include cash, time deposits, and treasury securities acquired with an original maturity of three
months or less.
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include time deposits and treasury securities with original maturities greater than three months
and less than one year.
Credit Losses
We are exposed to credit losses through sales of products and services. When extending credit, we evaluate customer
creditworthiness based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors that include, but are not limited to, the
customer’s credit score from external providers, financial condition, and past payment experience.
We assess allowances for credit losses on our trade receivables and lease receivable portfolios. Allowances are
evaluated by portfolio on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist. A provision for customer defaults is made
on a general formula basis as the risk of some default is expected but cannot yet be associated with specific
customers. The assessment of the likelihood of default is based on various factors, including the length of time the
receivables are past due, historical experience, existing economic conditions, and forward-looking information. When
we identify specific customers with known collectability issues, the assessment for credit losses is performed on an
individual basis, considering current and forward-looking information of the customer.
The use of forward-looking information considers economic conditions that may affect the customers’ ability to pay.
Although we historically have not experienced significant credit losses, our exposure to credit losses may increase if
our customers are adversely affected by economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic
recessions, disruption associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other customer-specific factors. We review
our reserves for credit losses on a quarterly basis.
63
Table of Contents
Trade receivables comprise amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of allowances
for credit losses. Changes to the carrying amount of the allowance for credit losses on trade receivables are
summarized below:
Balance at 30 September 2018 $26.4 
Provision for credit losses 7.7 
Write-offs charged against the allowance (6.8)
Currency translation and other (2.5)
Balance at 30 September 2019 $24.8 
Provision for credit losses 7.7 
Write-offs charged against the allowance (8.3)
Currency translation and other (0.3)
Balance at 30 September 2020 $23.9 
Adoption of new credit losses standard 0.5 
Provision for credit losses 2.7 
Write-offs charged against the allowance (3.8)
Currency translation and other 1.8 
Balance at 30 September 2021 $25.1 
In addition, our lease receivables are presented net of allowances for credit losses. As of 30 September 2021 and
2020, the credit quality of lease receivables did not require a material allowance for credit losses. For additional
information on our lease arrangements, refer to Note 11, Leases.
Inventories
We carry inventory that is comprised of finished goods, work-in-process, raw materials and supplies. Refer to Note 6,
Inventories, for further detail.
Inventories on our consolidated balance sheets are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the
cost of all our inventories on a first-in, first-out basis ("FIFO"). We write down our inventories for estimated
obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Equity Method Investments
The equity method of accounting is used when we exercise significant influence but do not have operating control,
generally assumed to be 20% – 50% ownership. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost
and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies. We use the cumulative earnings
approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Equity
investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
Plant and Equipment, net
Plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction costs, labor, and applicable
overhead related to installations are capitalized. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or
increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized. The costs of maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are
charged to expense as incurred.
Fully depreciated assets are retained in the gross plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until
they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed from the
accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in income. Refer to Note 8, Plant and
Equipment, net, for further detail.
64
Table of Contents
Computer Software
We capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Capitalized costs include purchased
computer software packages, payments to vendors/consultants for development and implementation or modification to
a purchased package to meet our requirements, payroll and related costs for employees directly involved in
development, and interest incurred while software is being developed. Capitalized costs are reflected in "Plant and
equipment, net" on the consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software,
generally a period of three to five years.
We capitalize costs incurred with the implementation of a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract,
consistent with our policy for software developed or obtained for internal use. However, the capitalized costs are
reflected in "Other noncurrent assets" on our consolidated balance sheets and expensed over the term of the related
hosting arrangement.
Capitalized Interest
As we build new plant and equipment, we include in the cost of these assets a portion of the interest payments we
make during the year. The amount of capitalized interest was $28.3, $15.9, and $13.5 in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and
2019, respectively.
Leases
As lessee, we recognize a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term
in excess of 12 months. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The arrangement contains a
lease when there is an identifiable asset, we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from that asset, and we
direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the arrangement. If the initial term of an
arrangement is 12 months or less, we have made an accounting election to not assess if these arrangements contain a
lease for inclusion on our balance sheet.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our
obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since our leases generally do
not provide an implicit discount rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. To determine the incremental borrowing rate,
we consider our unsecured borrowings and published market rates, and then adjust those rates to assume full
collateralization and to factor in the individual lease term, geography, and payment structure.
Our lease term includes periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that
we will exercise an option to extend or not exercise an option to terminate. Lease payments consider our practical
expedient to combine amounts for lease and related non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets in which
we are lessee. Fixed payments and payments associated with escalation clauses based on an index are included in the
ROU asset and lease liability at commencement. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and
lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our variable
lease payments primarily include the impact from escalation clauses that are not fixed or based on an index. Prepaid
lease payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets. Our lease agreements do not contain any material lease
incentives, residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that
are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and are evaluated for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We
assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset group. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be
recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Long-lived
assets meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
65
Table of Contents
Asset Retirement Obligations
The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The fair
value of the liability is measured using discounted estimated cash flows and is adjusted to its present value in
subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part
of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Our asset retirement
obligations are primarily associated with on-site long-term supply contracts under which we have built a facility on land
owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. Our asset retirement
obligations totaled $269.6 and $241.4 at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 16, Commitments
and Contingencies, for further detail.
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price (plus the fair value of
any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair market value of the net
assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Preliminary purchase price allocations are
made at the date of acquisition and finalized when information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date needed to finalize underlying estimates is obtained or when we determine that such information is not
obtainable, within a maximum measurement period of one year.
Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually. In addition, goodwill is tested more frequently if a change in
circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. Refer to Note 9, Goodwill, for
further detail.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology,
and certain land use rights. The cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated period of economic benefit. No residual value is estimated for these intangible assets. Indefinite-
lived intangible assets consist of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment
testing at least annually. In addition, intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the
occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists.
Customer relationships are generally amortized over periods of five to twenty-five years. Purchased patents and
technology and other finite-lived intangibles are generally amortized over periods of five to fifteen years. Other
intangibles includes certain land use rights, which are generally amortized over a period of fifty years. Amortizable lives
are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated period of economic benefit. Refer to Note 10, Intangible
Assets, for further detail.
Retirement Benefits
Our retirement benefit plans are discussed in Note 15, Retirement Benefits. The cost of benefits we contribute to
defined contribution plans is recognized in the year earned. The cost of benefits under our defined benefit and other
post-retirement plans is generally recognized over the employees’ service period. We use actuarial methods and
assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the determination of expense. Differences between
actual and expected results or changes in the value of obligations and plan assets are recognized systematically over
subsequent periods.
2.  NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Accounting Guidance Implemented in Fiscal Year 2021
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the measurement of credit losses, which requires measurement and
recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets, including trade receivables and lease receivables, held at the
reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The
method to determine a loss is different from the previous guidance, which delayed recognition of a credit loss until it
was probable that a loss had been incurred. We adopted this guidance on 1 October 2020 using a modified
retrospective approach with an after-tax cumulative-effect adjustment of $1.3 to retained earnings. Refer to the “Major
Accounting Polices – Credit Losses" section of Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, for a description of our accounting
policy on credit losses.
66
Table of Contents
Cloud Computing Implementation Costs
In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance which aligns the capitalization requirements for implementation costs
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the existing capitalization requirements for
implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. We adopted this guidance prospectively at
the beginning of fiscal year 2021. Eligible implementation costs previously capitalized in "Plant and equipment, net"
were reclassified to "Other noncurrent assets" on our consolidated balance sheets beginning in fiscal year 2021. This
guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes
In December 2019, the FASB issued an update to simplify the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent
application by clarifying or amending existing guidance. We adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2021.
This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
New Accounting Guidance to be Implemented
Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, the FASB issued an update to provide practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to
contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. This
update is primarily applicable to our contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR. The
amendments may be applied to impacted contracts and hedges prospectively through 31 December 2022. We had no
impacts on our hedging relationships related to reference rate reform in fiscal year 2021. We will continue to evaluate
the impact this guidance could have on our consolidated financial statements.
3.  ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal Year 2021
Gain on Exchange With Joint Venture Partner
As of 30 September 2020, we held a 50% ownership interest in Tyczka Industrie-Gases GmbH ("TIG"), a joint venture
in Germany with the Tyczka Group that is primarily a merchant gases business. We accounted for this arrangement as
an equity method investment in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment.
Effective 23 February 2021 (the "acquisition date"), we agreed with our joint venture partner to separate TIG into two
separate businesses. On the acquisition date, we acquired a portion of the business on a 100% basis, and our partner
paid us $10.8 to acquire the rest of the business. The exchange resulted in a gain of $36.8 ($27.3 after-tax), which is
reflected as “Gain on exchange with joint venture partner” on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year
ended 30 September 2021. The gain included $12.7 from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in the
portion of the business that we retained and $24.1 from the sale of our equity interest in the remaining business. The
gain was not recorded in segment results.
We estimated an acquisition date fair value of $15.4 for our previously held equity interest in the acquired portion of the
business using a market approach, which considered historical earnings and the application of a market-based multiple
derived from comparable transactions.
We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination within our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. As a result
of the acquisition, we recognized intangible assets of $16.7 for customer relationships, goodwill of $14.5, and plant and
equipment of $10.3. The customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of approximately 15 years.
The acquired assets were recorded at their estimated fair values based primarily on a preliminary purchase price
allocation. We may record adjustments to these assets during the preliminary purchase price allocation period, which
could be up to one year from the acquisition date.
We expect the acquisition to allow us to have more control over the business we retained and to serve customers more
effectively. The results of this business did not materially impact our consolidated income statements for the periods
presented.

Fiscal Year 2020
Asset Acquisition
On 17 April 2020, we acquired five operating hydrogen production plants from PBF Energy Inc. ("PBF") and
commenced contractual long-term supply of hydrogen from those plants to PBF's refineries. We accounted for the
transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded the aggregate purchase price of $580 to plant and equipment on our
consolidated balance sheets.
Business Combinations
We completed three acquisitions on 1 July 2020 that were accounted for as business combinations. These acquisitions
had an aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $185.4. The largest of these acquisitions was the purchase
of Oxygen & Argon Works Ltd., the leading manufacturer and marketer of industrial gases in Israel, primarily offering
merchant gas products. The results of this business are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment.
Fiscal Year 2019
As further discussed below, we completed three business combinations in fiscal year 2019.
Exchange of Equity Affiliate Investments
We previously held 50% ownership interests in High-Tech Gases (Beijing) Co., Ltd. ("High-Tech Gases") and WuXi Hi-
Tech Gas Co., Ltd. ("WuXi"), both of which were joint ventures with another industrial gas company in China. We
accounted for these arrangements as equity method investments in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment through
30 April 2019.
On 1 May 2019, we acquired our partner's 50% interest in WuXi in exchange for our 50% interest in High-Tech Gases.
The exchange resulted in a net gain of $29.1, of which $15.0 resulted from the revaluation of our previously held equity
interest in WuXi to its acquisition date fair value and $14.1 resulted from the disposition of our interest in High-Tech
Gases. The net gain is reflected as "Gain on exchange with joint venture partner" on our consolidated income
statements in fiscal year 2019 and was not recorded in results of the Industrial Gases – Asia segment.
We revalued our previously held 50% equity interest in WuXi based on an estimated acquisition date fair value of
$27.0. We calculated this fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach, which required
estimates and assumptions regarding projected revenue growth, customer attrition rates, profit margin, and discount
rate.
The acquisition of the remaining interest in WuXi was accounted for as a business combination. The results of this
business are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – Asia segment.
Other Fiscal Year 2019 Business Combinations
The remaining business combinations completed in fiscal year 2019 had total consideration, net of cash acquired,
of $126.6. The largest of these business combinations was the acquisition of ACP Europe SA ("ACP"), the largest
independent carbon dioxide business in Continental Europe. The results of this business are consolidated within our
Industrial Gases – EMEA segment.

4. REVENUE RECOGNITION
Nature of Goods and Services
The principal activities from which we generate sales from our contracts with customers, separated between our
regional industrial gases businesses and industrial gases equipment businesses, are described below with their
respective revenue recognition policies. For an overall summary of these policies and discussion on payment terms
and presentation, refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies.
Industrial Gases – Regional
Our regional industrial gases businesses produce and sell atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon
(primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air) and process gases such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, syngas, and specialty gases. We distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different
supply modes depending on various factors including the customer's volume requirements and location. Our supply
modes are as follows:
•On-site Gases—Supply mode associated with customers who require large volumes of gases and have
relatively constant demand. Gases are produced and supplied by large facilities on or near the customers’
facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities. These sale of gas contracts
generally have 15- to 20- year terms. We also deliver smaller quantities of product through small on-site plants
(cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators), typically via 10- to 15- year sale of gas contracts. The contracts within
this supply mode generally contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements with price
escalation provisions that are generally based on external indices. Revenue associated with this supply mode
is generally recognized over time during the period in which we deliver or make available the agreed upon
quantity of goods.
•Merchant Gases—Supply mode associated with liquid bulk and packaged gases customers. Liquid bulk
customers receive delivery of product in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer. The product is stored,
usually in its liquid state, in equipment we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a
gaseous state as needed. Packaged gases customers receive small quantities of product delivered in either
cylinders or dewars. Both liquid bulk and packaged gases sales do not contain minimum purchase
requirements as they are governed by contracts and/or purchase orders based on the customer's
requirements. These contracts contain stated terms that are generally 5 years or less. Performance obligations
associated with this supply mode are satisfied at a point in time when the customer receives and obtains
control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery.
The timing of revenue recognition for our regional industrial gases businesses is generally consistent with our right to
invoice the customer. Variable components of consideration that may not be resolved within the month, such as the
ability to earn an annual bonus or incur a penalty, are more relevant to on-site contracts and are considered
constrained as they can be impacted by a single significant event such as a plant outage, which could occur at the end
of a contract period. We consider contract modifications on an individual basis to determine appropriate accounting
treatment. However, contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively as they relate to distinct goods or
services associated with future periods of performance.
We mitigate energy and natural gas price risk contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-
through arrangements.
Industrial Gases – Equipment
We design and manufacture equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas
liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage. The Industrial Gases – Global and the
Corporate and other segments serve our sale of equipment customers.
Our sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation as the individual promised
goods or services contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services in the
contract for a single output to the customer.
69
Table of Contents
Revenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to
payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset
with alternative use. Otherwise, sale of equipment contracts are satisfied at the point in time the customer obtains
control of the equipment, which is generally determined based on the shipping terms of the contract. For contracts
recognized over time, we primarily recognize revenue using a cost incurred input method by which costs incurred to
date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance
obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and
proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.
Since our contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, contract modifications are typically
accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date
effect of such change. In addition, changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method
are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. Changes in estimates
unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $19 in fiscal year 2021. Changes in estimates favorably
impacted operating income by approximately $7 and $37 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our changes in
estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.
Disaggregation of Revenue

Remaining Performance Obligations
As of 30 September 2021, the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is estimated to be
approximately $24 billion. This amount includes fixed-charge contract provisions associated with our on-site and sale of
equipment supply modes. We estimate that approximately half of this revenue will be recognized over approximately
the next five years and the balance thereafter.
Expected revenue associated with new on-site plants that are not yet on stream is excluded from this amount. In
addition, this amount excludes consideration associated with contracts having an expected duration of less than one
year, and variable consideration for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice,
including pass-through costs related to energy and natural gas.
In the future, actual amounts will differ due to events outside of our control, including, but not limited to, inflationary
price escalations; currency exchange rates; and amended, terminated, or renewed contracts.

Contract Balances
The table below details balances arising from contracts with customers:
30 September Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020
Assets
Contract assets – current Other receivables and current assets $119.4 $55.9 
Contract fulfillment costs – current Other receivables and current assets 125.5 109.9 
Liabilities
Contract liabilities – current Payables and accrued liabilities 366.8 313.8 
Contract liabilities – noncurrent Other noncurrent liabilities 58.4 57.9 
Contract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. These
balances are reported on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting
period.
Contract assets primarily relate to our sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These
balances represent unbilled revenue, which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds
the amount invoiced to our customers. Our ability to invoice the customer for contract asset balances is not only based
on the passage of time, but also the achievement of certain contractual milestones.
Contract fulfillment costs primarily include deferred costs related to sale of equipment projects that cannot be
inventoried and for which we expect to recognize revenue upon transfer of control at project completion or costs related
to fulfilling a specific anticipated contract.
Costs to obtain a contract, or contract acquisition costs, are capitalized only after we have established a contract with
the customer. We elected to apply the practical expedient to expense these costs as they are incurred if the
amortization period of the asset that would have otherwise been recognized is one year or less. Our contract
acquisition costs capitalized as of 30 September 2021 and 2020 were not material.
Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract
liabilities are recognized as revenue when or as we perform under the contract. The increase in our contract liabilities –
current balance primarily relates to new sale of equipment projects as balances associated with our sale of gas
contracts are generally related to fixed charges and are relatively consistent period over period. During the fiscal year
ended 30 September 2021, we recognized approximately $240 in revenue associated with sale of equipment contracts
that was included within our contract liabilities as of 30 September 2020. Advanced payments from our customers do
not represent a significant financing component as these payments are intended for purposes other than financing,
such as to meet working capital demands or to protect us from our customer failing to meet its obligations under the
terms of the contract.
Changes in contract asset and liability balances during the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 were not materially
impacted by any other factors.
5.  DISCONTINUED OPERA TIONS
In fiscal year 2021, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $70.3. This included net tax benefits of $60.0
recorded upon release of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitations expired. Of
this benefit, we recorded $51.8 in the fourth quarter for liabilities associated with our former Performance Materials
Division ("PMD") and $8.2 in the third quarter for liabilities associated with our former Energy-from-Waste ("EfW")
business. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit of $10.3 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 primarily from the
settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of PMD in fiscal year 2017. Our consolidated statement
of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 includes $6.7 received as part of the settlement.
In fiscal year 2020, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $14.3. This resulted from a pre-tax loss of $19.0
recorded in the second quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental obligations associated with
the sale of our former Amines business in September 2006. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 16, Commitments
and Contingencies, for additional information. The loss did not have an impact on our cash flows for the fiscal year
ended 30 September 2020.

Jazan Gas Project Company
On 19 April 2015, Jazan Gas Project Company, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding, entered into a
20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan,
Saudi Arabia. We own 26% of the joint venture and guarantee repayment of our share of an equity bridge loan. ACWA
also guarantees their share of the loan. We determined that the joint venture is a variable interest entity for which we
are not the primary beneficiary. As of 30 September 2021, our consolidated balance sheets included $94.4 reflected
within "Payables and accrued liabilities" for our obligation to make equity contributions based on our proportionate
share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan.
Subsequent Event
As part of the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company transaction discussed in Note 24, Subsequent
Events, Jazan Gas Project Company sold its air separation units to Aramco in October 2021 and repaid its outstanding
debt, including the equity bridge loan.

Accumulated impairment losses (327.7) (338.7) (365.1)
Goodwill, net $911.5 $891.5 $797.1 
Accumulated impairment losses include the impacts of currency translation. These losses are attributable to our Latin America
reporting unit ("LASA") within the Industrial Gases – Americas segment.
We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The impairment test for goodwill
involves calculating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing that value to the carrying value. If the fair value
of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment charge, not to
exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we
conducted our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of all our reporting units exceeded
their carrying value.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible
assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their
carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets and
determined that the fair value of all our intangible assets exceeded their carrying value.
11.  LEASES
Lessee Accounting
We are the lessee under various agreements for real estate, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment that are accounted
for as operating leases. Our finance leases principally relate to the right to use machinery and equipment and are not
material.
Operating lease expense was $89.5 and $80.1 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts exclude
short-term and variable lease expenses, which were not material.
Amounts associated with operating leases and their presentation on our consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
30 September 2021 2020
Operating lease right-of-use assets
Other noncurrent assets $566.2 $376.8 
Operating lease liabilities
Payables and accrued liabilities 78.6 70.7

Calculated on the basis of the remaining lease term and the lease liability balance for each lease as of the reporting date.
Calculated on the basis of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability for each lease and the remaining balance of the
lease payments for each lease as of the reporting date.
The following maturity analysis of our operating lease liabilities as of 30 September 2021 presents the undiscounted
cash flows for each of the next five years and thereafter with a reconciliation to the lease liability recognized on our
balance sheet:

Table of Contents
We recorded $259 and $442 of noncash right-of-use asset additions during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We have additional operating leases that have not yet commenced as of 30 September 2021 having lease payments
totaling approximately $195.
Lessor Accounting
Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer have been accounted
for as leases. As we generally control the operations and maintenance of the assets that provide the supply of gas to
our customers, there have been no new arrangements that qualified as a lease in fiscal year 2021.
In cases where operating lease treatment is appropriate, there is no difference in revenue recognition over the life of
the contract as compared to accounting for the contract under a sale of gas agreement. These contracts qualify for a
practical expedient available to lessors to combine the lease and non-lease components and account for the combined
component in accordance with the accounting treatment for the predominant component. We elected to apply this
practical expedient and have accounted for the combined component as product sales under the revenue standard as
we control the operations and maintenance of the assets that provide the supply of gas to our customers.
In cases where sales-type lease treatment is appropriate, revenue and expense are recognized up front for the sale of
equipment component of the contract as compared to revenue recognition over the life of the arrangement under
contracts not qualifying as sales-type leases. Additionally, a portion of the revenue representing interest income from
the financing component of the lease receivable is reflected as sales over the life of the contract. During fiscal years
2021 and 2020, we recognized interest income of $67.4 and $71.2 on our lease receivables, respectively.
Our contracts generally do not have the option to extend or terminate the lease or provide the customer the right to
purchase the asset at the end of the contract term. Instead, renewal of such contracts requires negotiation of mutually
agreed terms by both parties. Unless the customer terminates within the required notice period, the contract will go into
evergreen. Given the long-term duration of our contracts, there is no assumed residual value for the assets at the end
of the lease term.
Lease receivables, net, primarily relate to sales-type leases on certain on-site assets which are collected over the
contract term. As of 30 September 2021 and 2020, our lease receivables, net were $824.7 and $903.0, respectively.
Lease receivables, net are primarily included within "Noncurrent lease receivables" on our consolidated balance
sheets, with the remaining balance in "Other receivables and current assets." The majority of our leases are of high
credit quality and were originated prior to fiscal year 2017. As of 30 September 2021 and 2020, the credit quality of

12.  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS
Currency Price Risk Management
Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency-
denominated transactions and net investments in foreign operations. It is our policy to seek to minimize our cash flow
volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. This is accomplished by identifying and evaluating the risk that our
cash flows will change in value due to changes in exchange rates and by executing strategies necessary to manage
such exposures. Our objective is to maintain economically balanced currency risk management strategies that provide
adequate downside protection.
Forward Exchange Contracts
We enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated
with highly anticipated cash flows and certain firm commitments, such as the purchase of plant and equipment. We also
enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the cash flow exposure on intercompany loans and third-party debt.
This portfolio of forward exchange contracts consists primarily of Euros and U.S. Dollars. The maximum remaining term
of any forward exchange contract currently outstanding and designated as a cash flow hedge at 30 September 2021 is
3.2 years.
Forward exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and
affiliates by creating a liability in a currency in which we have a net equity position. The primary currency pair in this
portfolio of forward exchange contracts is Euros and U.S. Dollars.
We also utilize forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges. These contracts are used to
economically hedge foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily working capital. The
primary objective of these forward exchange contracts is to protect the value of foreign currency-denominated
monetary assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their
receipt or settlement. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts consists of many different foreign currency pairs, with
a profile that changes from time to time depending on our business activity and sourcing decisions.

Total Forward Exchange Contracts $4,795.8 0.8 $5,163.9 0.8
The decrease in the notional value of forward exchange contracts that are not designated is primarily due to maturities.
We also use foreign currency-denominated debt to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in
certain foreign subsidiaries. The designated foreign currency-denominated debt and related accrued interest was
€1,297.5 million ($1,502.6) at 30 September 2021 and €1,288.7 million ($1,510.8) at 30 September 2020. The
designated foreign currency-denominated debt is presented within "Long-term debt" on the consolidated balance
sheets.
Debt Portfolio Management
It is our policy to identify, on a continuing basis, the need for debt capital and to evaluate the financial risks inherent in
funding the Company with debt capital. Reflecting the result of this ongoing review, our debt portfolio and hedging
program are managed with the intent to (1) reduce funding risk with respect to borrowings made by us to preserve our
access to debt capital and provide debt capital as required for funding and liquidity purposes, and (2) manage the
aggregate interest rate risk and the debt portfolio in accordance with certain debt management parameters.

Table of Contents
Interest Rate Management Contracts
We enter into interest rate swaps to change the fixed/variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio in order to maintain
the percentage of fixed- and variable-rate debt within the parameters set by management. In accordance with these
parameters, the agreements are used to manage interest rate risks and costs inherent in our debt portfolio. Our interest
rate management portfolio generally consists of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps (which are designated as fair value
hedges), pre-issuance interest rate swaps and treasury locks (which hedge the interest rate risk associated with
anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances and are designated as cash flow hedges), and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps
(which are designated as cash flow hedges). As of 30 September 2021, the outstanding interest rate swaps were
denominated in U.S. Dollars. The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements is equal to or less than the
designated debt being hedged. When interest rate swaps are used to hedge variable-rate debt, the indices of the
swaps and the debt to which they are designated are the same. It is our policy not to enter into any interest rate
management contracts which lever a move in interest rates on a greater than one-to-one basis.
Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap Contracts
We enter into cross currency interest rate swap contracts when our risk management function deems necessary. These
contracts may entail both the exchange of fixed- and floating-rate interest payments periodically over the life of the
agreement and the exchange of one currency for another currency at inception and at a specified future date. The
contracts are used to hedge either certain net investments in foreign operations or non-functional currency cash flows
related to intercompany loans. The current cross currency interest rate swap portfolio consists of fixed-to-fixed swaps
primarily between U.S. Dollars and Chinese Renminbi, U.S. Dollars and Indian Rupee, and U.S. Dollars and Chilean
Pesos.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain derivative instruments are executed under agreements that require us to maintain a minimum credit rating with
both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. If our credit rating falls below this threshold, the counterparty to the derivative
instruments has the right to request full collateralization on the derivatives’ net liability position. The net liability position
of derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features was $53.4 and $30.0 as of 30 September 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Because our current credit rating is above the various pre-established thresholds, no collateral has been
posted on these liability positions.
Counterparty Credit Risk Management
We execute financial derivative transactions with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions, all of which
are investment grade at this time. Some of our underlying derivative agreements give us the right to require the
institution to post collateral if its credit rating falls below the pre-established thresholds with Standard & Poor’s or
Moody’s. The collateral that the counterparties would be required to post was $38.1 and $76.5 as of 30 September
2021 and 2020, respectively. No financial institution is required to post collateral at this time, as all have credit ratings at
or above threshold.
13. FAIR V ALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as an exit price, or the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels
as follows:
•Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2—Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market
corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
•Level 3—Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability based on our own assumptions about the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The methods and assumptions used to measure the fair value of financial instruments are as follows:
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments primarily include time deposits with original maturities greater than three months and less than
one year. We estimated the fair value of our short-term investments, which approximates carrying value as of the
balance sheet date, using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 measurements were based on current
interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity.
Derivatives
The fair value of our interest rate management contracts and forward exchange contracts are quantified using the
income approach and are based on estimates using standard pricing models. These models consider the value of
future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the
time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard pricing models utilize inputs that are
derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves as well as currency spot and
forward rates; therefore, the fair value of our derivatives is classified as a Level 2 measurement. On an ongoing basis,
we randomly test a subset of our valuations against valuations received from the transaction’s counterparty to validate
the accuracy of our standard pricing models. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial
institutions.
Refer to Note 12, Financial Instruments, for a description of derivative instruments, including details related to the
balance sheet line classifications.
Long-term Debt, Including Related Party
The fair value of our debt is based on estimates using standard pricing models that consider the value of future cash
flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to
maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard valuation models utilize observable market data
such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot rates; therefore, the fair value of our debt is classified as a Level 2
measurement. We generally perform the computation of the fair value of these instruments.

Subsequent Event
In November 2021, we repaid the 3.0% Senior Note of $400, plus interest, on its maturity date.
Debt Covenants
Various debt agreements to which we are a party include financial covenants and other restrictions, including
restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. As of
30 September 2021, we are in compliance with all the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.
Credit Facilities
On 31 March 2021, we entered into a five-year $2,500 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2021
Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2021
Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. The only financial
covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to capitalization (equal to total debt plus total
equity) not to exceed 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of 30 September
2021.
The 2021 Credit Agreement replaced our previous five-year $2,300 revolving credit agreement, which was to have
matured on 31 March 2022. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement as of 30 September 2020
or at the time of its termination. No early termination penalties were incurred.
We have credit facilities available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries totaling $296.7, of which $176.2 was borrowed
and outstanding as of 30 September 2021.
2020 Debt Issuance
In fiscal year 2020, we issued U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes with aggregate principal amounts of
$3.8 billion and €1.0 billion, respectively. Our consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30
September 2020 includes long-term debt proceeds of $4,895.8 from these issuances.

15. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
We and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a
substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried
pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined
contribution plans were offered to new employees. The principal defined contribution plan is the Retirement Savings
Plan, in which a substantial portion of the U.S. employees participate. A similar plan is offered to U.K. employees. We
also provide other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to U.S. retirees who meet age and
service requirements.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment. The
components of net periodic (benefit) cost for our defined benefit pension plans for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019
were as follows:
2021 2020 2019

Other — 1.0 — 0.8 — 0.8 
Net Periodic (Benefit) Cost ($23.3) ($14.0) $15.8 ($8.8) $35.6 ($8.0)
Our service costs are primarily included within "Cost of sales" and "Selling and administrative" on our consolidated
income statements. The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not material. The
non-service related costs, including pension settlement losses, are presented outside operating income within "Other
non-operating income (expense), net."
Certain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate
officers, six months after their retirement date. A participant’s vested benefit is considered settled upon cash payment of
the lump sum. We recognize pension settlement losses when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and
interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of the plan for the fiscal year. We recognized pension settlement
losses of $1.3, $5.0 and $6.2 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to accelerate recognition of a portion of
actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the U.S. supplementary pension
plan.
We calculate net periodic benefit cost for a given fiscal year based on assumptions developed at the end of the
previous fiscal year. The following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of net
periodic benefit cost:

The net actuarial gains and losses represent the actual changes in the estimated obligation and plan assets that have
not yet been recognized in the consolidated income statements and are included in accumulated other comprehensive
loss. Actuarial gains arising during fiscal year 2021 are primarily attributable to higher than expected return on plan
assets and higher discount rates. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses that exceed a corridor are amortized over the
average remaining service period of active U.S. participants, which was approximately seven years as of 30 September
2021. For U.K. participants, accumulated actuarial gains and losses that exceed a corridor are amortized over the
average remaining life expectancy, which was approximately twenty-four years as of 30 September 2021.
The components recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on a pretax basis at 30 September consisted of
the following:

The accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service
rendered to a particular date, based on current salaries. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was $5,140.0
and $5,166.5 as of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The tables above include several pension arrangements that are not funded because of jurisdictional practice. The
ABO and PBO related to these plans as of 30 September 2021 were $86.2 and $91.7, respectively. As of 30
September 2021, the U.S. salaried and U.K. pension plans had plan assets in excess of both PBO and ABO resulting in
a decrease to the U.S. and International balances presented above. As of 30 September 2020, the PBO of these plans
exceeded the fair value of plan assets.

Pension Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy is to invest in diversified portfolios to earn a long-term return consistent with
acceptable risk in order to pay retirement benefits and meet regulatory funding requirements while minimizing company
cash contributions over time. De-risking strategies are also employed for closed plans as funding improves, generally
resulting in higher allocations to long duration bonds. The plans invest primarily in passive and actively managed equity
and debt securities. Equity investments are diversified geographically and by investment style and market
capitalization. Fixed income investments include sovereign, corporate and asset-backed securities generally
denominated in the currency of the plan.
Asset allocation targets are established based on the long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the
asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Assets are routinely rebalanced through
contributions, benefit payments, and otherwise as deemed appropriate. The actual and target allocations at the
measurement date are as follows:

In fiscal year 2021, the 6.75% expected return for U.S. plan assets was based on a weighted average of estimated
long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining asset class
returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as other
economic and market factors.
In fiscal year 2021, the 4.73% expected rate of return for international plan assets was based on a weighted average
return for plans outside the U.S., which vary significantly in size, asset structure and expected returns. The expected
asset return for the U.K. plan, which represents over 80% of the assets of our International plans, is 5.30% and was
derived from expected equity and debt security returns.

Table of Contents
The descriptions and fair value methodologies for the U.S. and International pension plan assets are as follows:
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity.
Equity Securities
Equity securities are valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or international exchange where the security
is actively traded and are therefore classified as Level 1 assets.
Equity Mutual and Pooled Funds
Shares of mutual funds are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. The mutual funds are required to
publish their daily NAV and to transact at that price. The mutual funds are deemed to be actively traded and are
classified as Level 1 assets. Units of pooled funds are valued at the per unit NAV determined by the fund manager
based on the value of the underlying traded holdings and are classified as Level 2 assets.
Corporate and Government Bonds
Corporate and government bonds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are either valued at quoted market prices
from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields
and credit ratings.
Fixed Income Pooled Funds
Fixed income pooled funds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year
end, which is determined by the fund manager based on quoted market pricing from observable pricing sources at the
reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields, credit ratings, or factors. Fixed income
pooled funds may hold government bonds, index linked bonds, corporate bonds, cash and derivative instruments.
Other Pooled Funds
Other pooled funds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year end,
which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments.
Insurance Contracts
Insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at contract value, which approximates the
estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance
company and discount rates that require inputs with limited observability.
Contributions and Projected Benefit Payments
Pension contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans for fiscal year 2021 were $44.6.
Contributions for funded plans resulted primarily from contractual and regulatory requirements. Benefit payments to
unfunded plans were due primarily to the timing of retirements. We anticipate contributing $40 to $50 to the defined
benefit pension plans in fiscal year 2022. These contributions are anticipated to be driven primarily by contractual and
regulatory requirements for funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon timing of
retirements.
Projected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are as follows:
U.S. International
2022 $179.3 $56.8 
2023 170.4 60.2 
2024 174.3 64.0 
2025 178.1 64.6 
2026 180.7 68.3 
2027-2031 936.5 375.9 
These estimated benefit payments are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary
significantly from these estimates.

Table of Contents
Defined Contribution Plans
We maintain a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") which forms part of the Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan ("RSP"). The ESOP was established in May of 2002. The balance of the RSP
is a qualified defined contribution plan including a 401(k) elective deferral component. A substantial portion of U.S.
employees are eligible and participate.
We treat dividends paid on ESOP shares as ordinary dividends. Under existing tax law, we may deduct dividends which
are paid with respect to shares held by the plan. Shares of our common stock in the ESOP totaled 1,941,938 as of 30
September 2021.
Our contributions to the RSP include a Company core contribution for certain eligible employees who do not receive
their primary retirement benefit from the defined benefit pension plans, with the core contribution based on a
percentage of pay that is dependent on years of service. For the RSP, we also make matching contributions on overall
employee contributions as a percentage of the employee contribution and include an enhanced contribution for certain
eligible employees that do not participate in the defined benefit pension plans. Worldwide contributions expensed to
income in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $53.3, $45.6, and $40.6, respectively.
Other Postretirement Benefits
We provide other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to certain U.S. retirees who meet
age and service requirements. The healthcare benefit is a continued medical benefit until the retiree reaches age 65.
Healthcare benefits are contributory, with contributions adjusted periodically. The retiree medical costs are capped at a
specified dollar amount, with the retiree contributing the remainder. The cost of these benefits was not material in fiscal
years 2021, 2020, and 2019. Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of the end of fiscal years 2021 and
2020 were $27.4 and $38.6, respectively, of which $5.5 and $7.2 were current obligations, respectively.
We recognize changes in other postretirement benefit plan obligations in other comprehensive income on a pretax
basis. In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recognized gains that arose during the period of $5.4 and $1.3, respectively.
There was $1.8 net actuarial gain amortization in fiscal year 2021 and no actuarial gain amortization in 2020 as the
corridor for the plan was not exceeded.
The net actuarial gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on a pretax basis was $6.6 and $3.0 as of
30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
We are involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property,
regulatory, product liability, and insurance matters. We do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings,
individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows.
In September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense ("CADE") issued a decision against our
Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged
anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $33 at 30 September 2021) on
Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice,
following an investigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of
industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003.
We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian courts.
On 6 May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda. was dismissed. CADE has
appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending. We, with advice of our outside legal counsel, have assessed the
status of this matter and have concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is
possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial
statements. In the event of an adverse final judgment, we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of
the fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $33 at 30 September 2021) plus interest accrued thereon until final
disposition of the proceedings.

Additionally, Winter Storm Uri, a severe winter weather storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast in February 2021, disrupted our
operations and caused power and natural gas prices to spike significantly in Texas. We are currently in the early stages
of litigation of a dispute regarding energy management services related to the impact of this unusual event, and other
disputes may arise from such power price increases. In addition, legislative action may affect power supply and energy
management charges. While it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs related to power supply and
energy management services in Texas related to the winter storm, it is too early to estimate potential losses, if any,
given significant unknowns resulting from the unusual nature of this event.
Environmental
In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA," the federal Superfund law), Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for
investigation or remediation. Presently, there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we,
along with others, have been designated a potentially responsible party by environmental authorities or are otherwise
engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our current and former manufacturing
sites. We continually monitor these sites for which we have environmental exposure.
Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2021 and 2020
included an accrual of $76.7 and $84.7, respectively, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities. The environmental
liabilities will be paid over a period of up to 30 years. We estimate the exposure for environmental loss contingencies to
range from $76 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $90 as of 30 September 2021.
Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties
in evaluating environmental exposures. Using reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the exposure level could
result in an increase to the environmental accrual. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental
exposures, a significant increase to the reasonably possible upper exposure level could occur if a new site is
designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or a significant
increase in our proportionate share occurs. We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with
environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on
our financial position or results of operations in any one year.
Pace
At 30 September 2021, $39.8 of the environmental accrual was related to the Pace facility.
In 2006, we sold our Amines business, which included operations at Pace, Florida, and recognized a liability for
retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at Pace. We are required by the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection ("FDEP") and the United States Environmental Protection Agency
("USEPA") to continue our remediation efforts. We recognized a before-tax expense of $42 in fiscal year 2006 in results
from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental accrual of $42 in continuing operations on the
consolidated balance sheets.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we completed an updated cost review of the environmental remediation
status at the Pace facility. The review was completed in conjunction with requirements to maintain financial assurance
per the Consent Order issued by the FDEP discussed below. Based on our review, we expect ongoing activities to
continue for 30 years. Additionally, we will require near-term spending to install new groundwater recovery wells and
ancillary equipment, in addition to future capital to consider the extended time horizon for remediation at the site. As a
result of these changes, we increased our environmental accrual for this site by $19 in continuing operations on the
consolidated balance sheets and recognized a before-tax expense of $19 in results from discontinued operations in the
second quarter of fiscal year 2020. There has been no change to the estimated exposure range related to the Pace
facility in fiscal year 2021.

Table of Contents
We have implemented many of the remedial corrective measures at the Pace facility required under 1995 Consent
Orders issued by the FDEP and the USEPA. Contaminated soils have been bioremediated, and the treated soils have
been secured in a lined on-site corrective action management unit. Several groundwater recovery systems have been
installed to contain and remove contamination from groundwater. We completed an extensive assessment of the site to
determine the efficacy of existing measures, what additional corrective measures may be needed, and whether newer
remediation technologies that were not available in the 1990s might be suitable to more quickly and effectively
remediate groundwater. Based on assessment results, we completed a focused feasibility study that has identified
alternative approaches that may more effectively remove contaminants. We continue to review alternative remedial
approaches with the FDEP and have started additional field work to support the design of an improved groundwater
recovery network with the objective of targeting areas of higher contaminant concentration and avoiding areas of high
groundwater iron which has proven to be a significant operability issue for the project. In the first quarter of 2015, we
entered into a new Consent Order with the FDEP requiring us to continue our remediation efforts at the Pace facility,
along with the completion of a cost review every 5 years. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we completed an
updated cost review which resulted in a change in assumptions regarding future operating costs as discussed above.
Piedmont
At 30 September 2021, $9.5 of the environmental accrual was related to the Piedmont site.
On 30 June 2008, we sold our Elkton, Maryland, and Piedmont, South Carolina, production facilities and the related
North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses. In connection with the
sale, we recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at the
Piedmont site. This site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner.
We are required by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control ("SCDHEC") to address both
contaminated soil and groundwater. Numerous areas of soil contamination have been addressed, and contaminated
groundwater is being recovered and treated. The SCDHEC issued its final approval to the site-wide feasibility study on
13 June 2017 and the Record of Decision for the site on 27 June 2018, after which we signed a Consent Agreement
Amendment memorializing our obligations to complete the cleanup of the site. Remediation has started in accordance
with the design, which includes in-situ chemical oxidation treatment, as well as the installation of a soil vapor extraction
system to remove volatile organic compounds from the unsaturated soils beneath the impacted areas of the plant. We
estimate that source area remediation and groundwater recovery and treatment will continue through 2029. Thereafter,
we expect this site to go into a state of monitored natural attenuation through 2047.
We recognized a before-tax expense of $24 in 2008 as a component of income from discontinued operations and
recorded an environmental liability of $24 in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. There have
been no significant changes to the estimated exposure.
Pasadena
At 30 September 2021, $11.2 of the environmental accrual was related to the Pasadena site.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, management committed to permanently shutting down our polyurethane
intermediates ("PUI") production facility in Pasadena, Texas. In shutting down and dismantling the facility, we have
undertaken certain obligations related to soil and groundwater contaminants. We have been pumping and treating
groundwater to control off-site contaminant migration in compliance with regulatory requirements and under the
approval of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"). We estimate that the pump and treat system
will continue to operate until 2042.
We plan to perform additional work to address other environmental obligations at the site. This additional work includes
remediating, as required, impacted soils, investigating groundwater west of the former PUI facility, performing post
closure care for two closed RCRA surface impoundment units, establishing engineering controls, and performing a pilot
study to treat impacted soils. In 2012, we estimated the total exposure at this site to be $13. There have been no
significant changes to the estimated exposure.

Table of Contents
Asset Retirement Obligations
Our asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with long-term on-site supply contracts under which we have
built a facility on land owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term.
The retirement of assets includes the contractually required removal of a long-lived asset from service and
encompasses the sale, removal, abandonment, recycling, or disposal of the assets as required at the end of the
contract term. These obligations are primarily reflected within "Other noncurrent liabilities" on the consolidated balance
sheets. The timing and/or method of settlement of these obligations are conditional on a future event that may or may
not be within our control.
Changes to the carrying amount of our asset retirement obligations were as follows:
Balance at 30 September 2019 $208.2 
Additional accruals 22.0 
Liabilities settled (2.8)
Accretion expense 9.5 
Currency translation adjustment 4.5

Warranties and Guarantees
We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with warranties and guarantees will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.
Warranties
We, in the normal course of business operations, have issued product warranties related to equipment sales. Also,
contracts often contain standard terms and conditions which typically include a warranty and indemnification to the
buyer that the goods and services purchased do not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. The provision for
estimated future costs relating to warranties is not material to the consolidated financial statements.
Guarantees
To date, no equity contributions or payments have been made since the inception of the guarantees discussed below.
The fair value of these guarantees is not material.
We are party to an equity support agreement and operations guarantee related to an air separation facility constructed
in Trinidad for a venture in which we own 50%. At 30 September 2021, maximum potential payments under joint and
several guarantees were $24.0. Exposures under the guarantees decline over time and will be completely extinguished
by 2024.
We guaranteed the repayment of our 25% share of an equity bridge loan that has been provided to fund equity
commitments to the Jazan Gas Project Company joint venture with ACWA Holding in Saudi Arabia. ACWA also
guarantees their share of the loan. As of 30 September 2021, our maximum exposure under the guarantee was
approximately $100, and payables and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets included $94.4 for our
obligation to make equity contributions.
We also have a long-term sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the
industrial gas facilities that will supply gases to Aramco. We provided bank guarantees to the joint venture to support
our performance under the contract. As of 30 September 2021, our maximum potential payments were $247.

As part of the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company transaction discussed in Note 24, Subsequent
Events, Jazan Gas Project Company sold its air separation units to Aramco in October 2021 and repaid its outstanding
debt, including the equity bridge loan. Our bank guarantees that support performance under the sale of equipment
contract remain in place.
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
We are obligated to make future payments under unconditional purchase obligations as summarized below:
2022 $1,656 
2023 540 
2024 543 
2025 563 
2026 545 
Thereafter 6,135 
Total $9,982 
Approximately $8.3 billion of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium and rare gases. The majority of
these obligations occur after fiscal year 2026. Helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to helium refining
plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of
natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain
take-if-tendered provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under
medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in our helium sourcing contracts are generally longer than
our customer sales contracts, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its
unique physical and chemical properties.
We estimate our maximum obligation for future purchases of plant and equipment to be approximately $1.0 billion
based on open purchase orders as of 30 September 2021. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable
and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to reschedule, cancel, or otherwise modify based on our
business needs. We have disclosed this obligation in fiscal year 2022; however, timing of actual satisfaction of the
obligation may vary.
Our unconditional purchase obligations also include commitments for power and natural gas supply as well as
feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. Our long-term sales
contracts to customers are generally matched to the term of these obligations and provide recovery of price increases.
As a result, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

17. CAPIT AL STOCK
Common Stock
Authorized common stock consists of 300 million shares with a par value of $1 per share. As of 30 September 2021,
249 million shares were issued, with 221 million outstanding.
On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding
common stock. We repurchase shares pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, through repurchase agreements established with several brokers. We did not purchase any of our
outstanding shares during fiscal year 2021. At 30 September 2021, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.
A summary of the changes in common shares in fiscal year 2021 is presented below:
Fiscal Year Ended 30 September 2021 2020 2019
Number of common shares outstanding, beginning of year 221,017,459 220,415,262 219,515,245 
Issuance of treasury shares for stock option and award plans 379,296 602,197 900,017 
Number of common shares outstanding, end of year 221,396,755 221,017,459 220,415,262 
Preferred Stock
Authorized preferred stock consisted of 25 million shares with a par value of $1 per share, of which 2.5 million were
designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. There were no preferred shares issued or outstanding as
of 30 September 2021 and 2020.
18. SHARE-BASED COMPENSA TION
Our outstanding share-based compensation programs include deferred stock units and stock options. During the fiscal
year ended 30 September 2021, we granted market-based and time-based deferred stock units. We have not issued
stock option awards since fiscal year 2015. The terms of our share-based awards are fixed at the grant date. We issue
shares from treasury stock upon payout of deferred stock units and exercise of stock options.
At the annual shareholders meeting held on 28 January 2021, the shareholders approved a new Long-Term Incentive
Plan ("LTIP"), which has an authorized pool of 1,500,000 shares available for future grant, plus additional shares
underlying awards outstanding on the date the LTIP was adopted but that are not issued. As of 30 September 2021,
there were 1,566,433 shares available for future grant under our LTIP.
Share-based compensation cost recognized on the consolidated income statements is summarized below:
2021 2020 2019
Before-tax share-based compensation cost $44.5 $55.8 $41.2 
Income tax benefit (11.0) (13.0) (9.7)
After-tax share-based compensation cost $33.5 $42.8 $31.5 
Before-tax share-based compensation cost relates to deferred stock units and is primarily included in "Selling and
administrative" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of share-based compensation cost capitalized in
fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was not material.

Table of Contents
Deferred Stock Units
We have granted deferred stock units to executives, selected employees, and outside directors. These deferred stock
units entitle the recipient to one share of common stock upon vesting, which is conditioned, for employee recipients, on
continued employment during the deferral period and may be conditioned on achieving certain performance targets.
We grant deferred stock unit awards with a two- to five-year deferral period that is subject to payout upon death,
disability, or retirement. Deferred stock units issued to outside directors are paid after service on the Board of Directors
ends at the time elected by the director (not to exceed 10 years after service ends). We generally expense the grant-
date fair value of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period; however, expense recognition is
accelerated for retirement eligible individuals who meet the requirements for vesting upon retirement. We have elected
to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than to estimate them. Forfeitures have not been significant historically.
Market-based deferred stock units vest as long as the employee continues to be employed by the Company and upon
the achievement of the performance target. The performance target, which is approved by the Compensation
Committee, is our share price appreciation and dividends paid, or "total shareholder return," in relation to a defined
peer group over a three-year performance period beginning 1 October of the fiscal year of grant. We granted 77,251,
80,215, and 114,929 market-based deferred stock units in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
The fair value of market-based deferred stock units was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these
equity awards are tied to a market condition. The model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of
satisfying the market condition stipulated in the grant and calculates the fair value of the awards. We generally expense
the grant-date fair value of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The estimated grant-date fair
value of market-based deferred stock units was $235.48, $275.19, and $229.61 per unit in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and
2019, respectively. The calculation of the fair value of these market-based deferred stock units used the following
assumptions:
2021 2020 2019
Expected volatility 29.9 % 17.8 % 17.5 %
Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 1.6 % 2.8 %
Expected dividend yield 2.1 % 2.4 % 2.6 %
In addition, we granted 110,555 time-based deferred stock units at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $282.48.
In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we granted 123,448 and 169,666 time-based deferred stock units at a weighted average
grant-date fair value of $230.92 and $168.68, respectively.
A summary of deferred stock unit activity in fiscal year 2021 is presented below:
Shares (000)Weighted Average

Date Fair Value
Deferred stock units outstanding at 30 September 2020 926 $181.14

Forfeited (17) 241.55 
Adjusted 87 161.64 
Deferred stock units outstanding at 30 September 2021 854 $194.12 
Cash payments made for deferred stock units totaled $5.2, $4.8, and $1.9 in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively. As of 30 September 2021, there was $47.0 of unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred stock
units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. The total fair value of
deferred stock units paid out during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, including shares vested in prior periods, was
$88.0, $65.4, and $19.2, respectively.

Table of Contents
Stock Options
We have granted awards of options to purchase common stock to executives and selected employees. The exercise
price of stock options equals the market price of our stock on the date of the grant. Options generally vest incrementally
over three years and remain exercisable for ten years from the date of grant. As of 30 September 2021, there was no
unrecognized compensation cost as all stock option awards were fully vested.
A summary of stock option activity in fiscal year 2021 is presented below:
Shares (000)Weighted Average
Exercise Price
Stock options outstanding and exercisable at 30 September 2020 941 $96.95 
Exercised (140) 80.63 
Stock options outstanding and exercisable at 30 September 2021 801 $99.79 
The weighted average remaining contractual term of stock options outstanding and exercisable at 30 September 2021
was 1.9 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of these stock options was $125, which represents the amount by which
our closing stock price of $256.11 as of 30 September 2021 exceeds the exercise price multiplied by the number of in-
the-money options outstanding or exercisable. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal years 2021,
2020, and 2019 was $29.0, $65.7, and $87.2, respectively.
Compensation cost is generally recognized over the stated vesting period consistent with the terms of the arrangement,
which is either on a straight-line or graded-vesting basis. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible
individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement.
Cash received from option exercises during fiscal year 2021 was $10.6. The total tax benefit realized from stock option
exercises in fiscal year 2021 was $6.8, of which $6.5 was the excess tax benefit.

Table of Contents
Diluted EPS attributable to Air Products reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other share-
based awards were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive effect is computed using the treasury stock
method, which assumes all share-based awards are exercised, and the hypothetical proceeds from exercise are used
by the Company to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. To the extent they would
have been dilutive, the incremental shares, or the difference between shares assumed to be issued versus purchased,
are included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation. There were no antidilutive outstanding share-based
awards in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.

India Finance Act 2020
On 27 March 2020, the Indian government passed Finance Act 2020 (the "India Finance Act"), which amended rules
regarding the taxation of dividends declared and distributed by Indian companies. Under the India Finance Act, future
dividends declared or distributed by an Indian company are no longer subject to dividend distribution tax. Instead, any
non-resident recipient is subject to a withholding tax. Our income tax provision for the fiscal year ended 30 September
2020 reflected an expense of $20.3 for estimated withholding taxes that we may incur on future dividends related to
INOX Air Products Private Limited ("INOX"), an equity affiliate investment in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment.
Additionally, we recorded a benefit of $33.8 within "Equity affiliates' income" for our share of accumulated dividend
distribution taxes released with respect to INOX.
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act” or "Tax Reform"),
which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to
21%, a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as other changes. Our consolidated income
statements reflect a discrete net income tax expense of $43.8 in fiscal year 2019 related to impacts of the Tax Act. The
net expense included the reversal of a non-recurring $56.2 benefit initially recorded in fiscal year 2018 related to the
U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, which was eliminated by regulations issued in fiscal year 2019. The reversal
in 2019 was partially offset by a benefit of $12.4 to reduce the total expected costs of the deemed repatriation tax.
As of 30 September 2021, the remaining liability for the deemed repatriation tax is $177.7, $157.1 of which is presented
within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We are paying this obligation in installments over five
remaining years.
Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. A
reconciliation of the differences between the United States federal statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is
provided below:
(Percent of income before taxes) 2021 2020 2019
U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %
State taxes, net of federal benefit 0.9 0.6 1.0 
Income from equity affiliates (2.5) (2.3) (2.0)
Foreign tax differentials 0.5 0.1 1.0 
Tax on foreign repatriated earnings 0.7 0.9 0.1 
Share-based compensation (0.7) (0.8) (0.6)
Tax reform repatriation — — 1.9 
Other (1.4) 0.2 (1.4)
Effective Tax Rate 18.5 % 19.7 % 21.0 %
Foreign tax differentials represent the differences between foreign earnings subject to foreign tax rates that are different
than the U.S. federal statutory rate and include tax holidays and incentives. Our income tax holidays relate to
operations in jurisdictions that provide reduced income tax rates for certain qualifying activities and are conditional upon
us meeting certain operating thresholds. The impact of these tax holidays decreased income tax expense by $26.9
($0.12 per share) in fiscal year 2020, primarily related to a preferential tax rate in China that is effective until 31
December 2030. This includes the impact of remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2020 due to an
extension of the holiday period in China. The impact of tax holidays in fiscal years 2021 and 2019 was not material.
Tax on foreign repatriated earnings includes benefits and costs related to U.S. and foreign taxation on the current and
future repatriation of foreign earnings and a U.S. benefit for related foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate in 2020
reflects impacts from the India Finance Act 2020 discussed above. In addition, the Tax Act included new provisions
related to the taxation of foreign operations, known as Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”). We have elected as
an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost when incurred.
Share-based compensation reflects the impact from recognition of $17.0, $20.0, and $14.6 of excess tax benefits in our
provision for income taxes during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
101
Table of Contents
In fiscal year 2021, other includes net tax benefits of $21.5, including interest, resulting from the release of U.S.
unrecognized tax benefits upon expiration of the statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions taken in prior years.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
30 September 2021 2020
Gross Deferred Tax Assets
Retirement benefits and compensation accruals $69.4 $209.0 
Tax loss carryforwards 120.9 112.6 
Tax credits and other tax carryforwards 27.3 40.3 
Reserves and accruals 74.5 67.0 
Currency losses 30.4 30.4 
Other 44.0 64.6 
Valuation allowance (97.6) (95.0)
Deferred Tax Assets 268.9 428.9 
Gross Deferred Tax Liabilities
Plant and equipment 1,171.8 1,110.9 
Unremitted earnings of foreign entities 69.1 58.7 
Partnership and other investments 15.3 19.3 
Intangible assets 86.2 83.6 
Other 7.2 3.9 
Deferred Tax Liabilities 1,349.6 1,276.4 
Net Deferred Income Tax Liability $1,080.7 $847.5 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within the consolidated balance sheets as follows:
2021 2020
Deferred Tax Assets
Other noncurrent assets $100.2 $115.1 
Deferred Tax Liabilities
Deferred income taxes 1,180.9 962.6 
Net Deferred Income Tax Liability $1,080.7 $847.5 
Deferred tax liabilities related to plant and equipment increased due to the impact of accelerated tax depreciation
deductions in excess of book depreciation primarily in the United States. Deferred tax assets related to retirement
benefits and compensation accruals are impacted by changes in plan assets and benefit obligations that have been
recognized in other comprehensive income. This balance decreased primarily due to higher than expected asset
returns and higher discount rates. Deferred tax assets related to tax credits and other tax carryforwards decreased
primarily due to the utilization of tax credits against our income tax liabilities.
As of 30 September 2021, we had the following deferred tax assets for certain tax credits:
Jurisdiction Gross Tax Asset Expiration Period
U.S. State $2.2 2022 - 2035
U.S. Federal 2.1 2027 - 2031
Foreign 27.5 2022 - 2041; Indefinite
Of the $27.5 foreign tax credits, $14.2 have indefinite carryforward periods.
102
Table of Contents
As of 30 September 2021, we had the following loss carryforwards:
Jurisdiction Gross Loss Carryforward Expiration Period
U.S. State Net Operating Loss $318.8 2022 - 2040
U.S. Federal Capital Loss 26.5 2025
Foreign Net Operating Loss 258.8 2022 - 2036; Indefinite
Foreign Capital Loss 221.6 Indefinite
Of the $258.8 of foreign net operating loss carryforwards, $111.5 have indefinite carryforward periods.
The valuation allowance was $97.6 and $95.0 as of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of 30 September
2021, the balance primarily related to $35.1 of foreign credits and loss carryforwards as well as $55.4 related to foreign
capital losses that were generated from the loss recorded on the exit from the Energy-from-Waste project in 2016. If
events warrant the reversal of the valuation allowance, it would result in a reduction of tax expense. We believe it is
more likely than not that future earnings and reversal of deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax
assets, net of existing valuation allowance, as of 30 September 2021.
We record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures unless
those earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Such earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. The
cumulative undistributed earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate
joint ventures are included in retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $5.9 billion as of
30 September 2021. An estimated $540.4 in additional foreign withholding and other income taxes would be due if
these earnings were remitted as dividends.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and
penalties, is as follows:
2021 2020 2019
Unrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of year $237.0 $231.7 $233.6 
Additions for tax positions of the current year 14.5 7.6 7.8 
Additions for tax positions of prior years 3.5 17.7 14.2 
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (8.2) (4.1) (14.7)
Settlements (3.1) (1.2) (1.5)
Statute of limitations expiration (104.6) (14.0) (3.9)
Foreign currency translation 1.2 (0.7) (3.8)
Unrecognized tax benefits balance at end of year $140.3 $237.0 $231.7 
Of our unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2021, $73.7 would impact the effective tax rate from continuing
operations if recognized.
In fiscal year 2021, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits decreased $104.6 due to statute of limitation expirations. We
released reserves of $65.6 related to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division (“PMD”), $8.2 associated
with our former Energy-from-Waste business (“EfW”), and $27.5 for other reserves, including those associated with a
tax election benefit related to a non-U.S. subsidiary in 2017. Upon release of the reserves related to PMD and EfW, we
recorded income tax benefits of $51.8 and $8.2, respectively, as a component of discontinued operations. The PMD
reserve was net of related deferred tax assets of $13.8. The release of other reserves of $27.5 was net of related
deferred tax assets of $8.4 and resulted in an income tax benefit, including interest, of $21.5.
Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a component of income tax expense and
totaled ($0.2), $6.1, and $12.0 in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our 2021 expense reflects a benefit
from the reversal of accrued interest on reserves released during the period. Our accrued balance for interest and
penalties was $24.9 and $25.2 as of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Income Tax Examinations
We are currently under examination in a number of tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that a change in our
unrecognized tax benefits may occur in fiscal year 2022 if any of these examinations are resolved during the next
twelve months. However, quantification of an estimated range cannot be made as of the date of this report.
We generally remain subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the years indicated below:

Related Party Transactions
Our consolidated income statements include sales to some of our equity affiliates and joint venture partners as well as
other income primarily from fees charged for use of Air Products' patents and technology. Sales to and other income
from related parties totaled approximately $225, $335, and $410 for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021, 2020,
and 2019, respectively. Sales agreements with related parties include terms that are consistent with those that we
believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party. As of 30 September 2021 and 2020,
our consolidated balance sheets included related party trade receivables of approximately $90 and $95, respectively.
In addition, refer to Note 14, Debt, for information concerning debt owed to related parties.
Facility Closures
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recorded a charge of $23.2 primarily for a noncash write-down of
assets associated with a contract termination in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment. This charge is reflected as
"Facility closure" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not
recorded in segment results.
In December 2018, one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental
reasons. As a result, we recognized a charge of $29.0 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 primarily related to the
write-off of onsite assets. This charge was reflected as “Facility closure” on our consolidated income statements for the
fiscal year ended 30 September 2019 and was not recorded in segment results.

Company Headquarters Relocation Income (Expense)
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we sold property at our former corporate headquarters located in
Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, in anticipation of relocating our U.S. headquarters. We received net proceeds of $44.1 and
recorded a gain of $33.8, which is reflected on our consolidated income statements as "Company headquarters
relocation income (expense)" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020. The gain was not recorded in the results of
the Corporate and other segment.
Cost Reduction Actions
In fiscal year 2019, we recognized an expense of $25.5 for severance and other benefits associated with position
eliminations. These actions were taken to drive cost synergies primarily within the Industrial Gases – EMEA and the
Industrial Gases – Americas segments. The charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements as "Cost
reduction actions" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019 and was not recorded in segment results.
23. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMA TION
Our reporting segments reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews results and allocates
resources. Except in the Industrial Gases – EMEA and Corporate and other segments, each reporting segment meets
the definition of an operating segment and does not include the aggregation of multiple operating segments. Our
Industrial Gases – EMEA and Corporate and other segments each include the aggregation of two operating segments
that meet the aggregation criteria under GAAP.
As of 30 September 2021, our reporting segments are:
•Industrial Gases – Americas;
•Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa);
•Industrial Gases – Asia;
•Industrial Gases – Global; and
•Corporate and other
On 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 October 2021.
Refer to Note 24, Subsequent Events, for additional information.
Industrial Gases – Regional
The regional Industrial Gases segments (Americas, EMEA, and Asia) include the results of our regional industrial gas
businesses, which produce and sell atmospheric gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases, such as
hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide (CO), carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide);
and specialty gases. The industrial gases business also develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or
processing of gases, such as air separation units and non-cryogenic generators.
We supply gases to diversified customers in many industries, including those in refining, chemical, gasification, metals,
electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage, through a variety of supply modes. For additional information, refer
to Note 4, Revenue Recognition.
Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Steam methane reformers utilize
natural gas as the primary raw material, and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for
the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. We mitigate energy, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price
fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through and tolling arrangements.
The regional Industrial Gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by
the equity method. The largest of these joint ventures operate in China, India, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
and Thailand.
Each of the regional Industrial Gases segments competes against global industrial gas companies as well as regional
competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas
applications. We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to
provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers.2
106
Table of Contents
Industrial Gases – Global
The Industrial Gases – Global segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment
for air separation. The equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and
petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. The
Industrial Gases – Global segment also includes centralized global costs associated with management of all the
Industrial Gases segments. These costs include Industrial Gases global administrative costs, product development
costs, and research and development costs. We compete with a large number of firms for all the offerings included in
the Industrial Gases – Global segment. Competition in the equipment business is based primarily on technological
performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.
Corporate and other
The Corporate and other segment includes our liquefied natural gas, turbo machinery equipment and services, and
distribution sale of equipment businesses as well as our corporate support functions that benefit all segments.
Competition for the sale of equipment businesses is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical
know-how, price, and performance guarantees.
The results of the Corporate and other segment also include income and expense that is not directly associated with
the other segments, such as foreign exchange gains and losses.
In addition to assets of the global businesses included in this segment, other assets include cash and cash items,
short-term investments, deferred tax assets, and financial instruments.
Customers
We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of
our consolidated revenues.
Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies. We
evaluate the performance of segments based upon reported segment operating income.

24. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Equity Affiliate Investment in Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company (“JIGPC”)
On 27 October 2021, we made an initial investment of $1.6 billion in Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company
("JIGPC"). JIGPC is a joint venture with Saudi Aramco Power Company (a subsidiary of Aramco), ACWA Power, and Air
Products Qudra in the Jazan Economic City, Saudi Arabia. Our investment, which was made primarily in the form of
shareholder loans, represents a 55% interest in the joint venture, of which 4% is attributable to the non-controlling
partner of Air Products Qudra. Our $1.6 billion investment includes approximately $130 received from the non-
controlling partner in September 2021. This cash receipt is reflected within “Investments by noncontrolling interests” on
our consolidated statements of equity and cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021.
We expect to make an additional investment in JIGPC of approximately $1 billion in 2023.
We determined JIGPC is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we will
account for our investment in JIGPC under the equity method within the Industrial Gases – Middle East segment, a new
reporting segment in fiscal year 2022 as discussed below.
JIGPC Joint Venture
On 27 September 2021, JIGPC signed definitive agreements for the acquisition of $12 billion of assets from Aramco
and related project financing for the purchase. JIGPC will complete the acquisition of the project assets, which include
power blocks, gasifiers, air separation units, syngas cleanup assets, and utilities, in two phases. JIGPC will
commission, operate, and maintain the project assets to supply electricity, steam, hydrogen and utilities to Aramco’s
refinery and terminal complex under a 25-year agreement.(A)
(A)
109
Table of Contents
The first phase was completed on 27 October 2021 and included $7 billion of the assets. The second phase is
expected to be funded and completed in 2023. JIGPC will account for the asset transfer as a financing, recording a
financing receivable upon acquisition and recognizing financing income over the supply term.
Jazan Gas Project Company
Jazan Gas Project Company (“JGPC”), a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding, entered into a 20-year
oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement in 2015 to supply Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant in Jazan, Saudi Arabia.
Air Products owns 26% of the joint venture. In October 2021, the supply agreement between JGPC and Aramco was
terminated, and JGPC sold its air separation units to Aramco. We initially sold these assets to JGPC and deferred
revenue and profit equal to our ownership percentage in the joint venture. With the termination of the supply agreement
and sale of the air separation units complete, we will recognize the remaining deferred profit in equity affiliates’ income
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Segment Reorganization
On 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments. Beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2022, we will report our results under the following five reporting segments:
•Industrial Gases – Americas;
•Industrial Gases – Asia;
•Industrial Gases – Europe;
•Industrial Gases – Middle East; and
•Corporate and other
The reorganization reflects the separation of our former Industrial Gases – EMEA segment into two separate reporting
segments: Industrial Gases – Europe and Industrial Gases – Middle East. The results of an affiliate formerly reflected in
the Industrial Gases – Asia segment will now be reported in the Industrial Gases – Middle East segment. Additionally,
the results of our Industrial Gases – Global operating segment will be reflected in the Corporate and other segment.
Except for the Corporate and other segment, each reporting segment will meet the definition of an operating segment
and will not include the aggregation of multiple operating segments. Our Corporate and other segment will include the
aggregation of three operating segments that meet the aggregation criteria under GAAP.
Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, segment results will be
presented on a retrospective basis to reflect the reorganization.
