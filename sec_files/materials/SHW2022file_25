Basis of Reportable Segments
The Company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing
performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. The Company has three reportable operating segments: The
Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (individually, a “Reportable Segment” and
collectively, the “Reportable Segments”). The Company reports all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that
are not reportable in the Administrative segment. For more information about the Reportable Segments, see Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
The Americas Group
The Americas Group consisted of 4,859 company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Latin America and
the Caribbean region at December 31, 2021. Each store in this segment is engaged in servicing the needs of architectural and
industrial paint contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. These stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams and other controlled
brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products. The majority of
these products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Brands Group. In addition, each store sells select
purchased associated products. In addition to our stores in the Latin America region, The Americas Group meets regional customer
demands through developing, licensing, manufacturing, distributing and selling a variety of architectural paints, coatings and
related products in North and South America. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the
business of this segment. At December 31, 2021, The Americas Group consisted of operations from subsidiaries in 10 foreign
countries.
Consumer Brands Group
The Consumer Brands Group supplies a broad portfolio of branded and private-label architectural paint, stains, varnishes, industrial
products, wood finishes products, wood preservatives, applicators, corrosion inhibitors, aerosols, caulks and adhesives to retailers
and distributors throughout North America, as well as in China and Europe. The Consumer Brands Group also supports the
Company’s other businesses around the world with new product research and development, manufacturing, distribution and
logistics. Approximately 62% of the total sales of the Consumer Brands Group in 2021 were intersegment transfers of products
primarily sold through The Americas Group. At December 31, 2021, the Consumer Brands Group consisted of operations in the
United States and subsidiaries in 5 foreign countries. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private-label products is
performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third-party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-
user of the product. The Consumer Brands Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of
the sales and related profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to
ongoing environmental compliance measures at sites currently in operation.
Performance Coatings Group
The Performance Coatings Group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial (metal and
plastic) applications, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings, coil coatings, packaging coatings and performance-®

based resins and colorants worldwide. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams
and other controlled brand products are distributed through The Americas Group and this segment’s 282 company-operated
branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third-party
distributors. The Performance Coatings Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the
sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability
of the segment. At December 31, 2021, the Performance Coatings Group consisted of operations in the United States and
subsidiaries in 44 foreign countries.
Administrative Segment
The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included in
the Administrative segment is interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and
environmental-related matters, and other expenses which are not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The
Administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment is the
operations of a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties
held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this
segment represent external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in
its primary businesses. Material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in
determining the performance of the Administrative segment.
Raw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale
Raw materials and products purchased for resale make up the majority of our consolidated cost of goods sold. Raw materials may
vary considerably by the specific paint or coating being manufactured but can generally be divided into the following categories:
resins and latex, pigments, additives, solvents, and metal or plastic containers. A significant portion of these raw materials are
derived from various upstream petrochemical and related commodity feedstocks, notably propylene. Raw materials are sourced
from multiple suppliers globally, typically within the geographic region where our products are being manufactured. A small
portion of specialized resins and other products are manufactured in house. We also purchase a variety of products for resale that
are highly complementary to our paint and coating offerings, notably spray equipment and parts, floorcovering, and assorted
sundries. We attempt, if feasible, to mitigate our potential risk associated with the sourcing of our raw materials and other products
through inventory management, strategic relationships with key suppliers, alternative sourcing strategies and long-term investments
to expand our manufacturing capabilities. See Item 1A Risk Factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw
materials.
Seasonality
The majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. However, periods of
economic downturn can alter these seasonal patterns. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment.
Working Capital
In order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first
quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which
include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company’s liquidity and capital
resources, see the “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow” section in Item 7.
Trademarks and Trade Names
Customer recognition of trademarks and trade names owned or licensed by the Company collectively contribute significantly to our
sales. The major trademarks and trade names used by each of the Reportable Segments are set forth below.
•The Americas Group: Sherwin-Williams®, Cashmere®, Colorgin®, Condor®, Duration®, Emerald®, Harmony®, Kem

Patents
Although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment, The Americas Group and
the Performance Coatings Group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade names to
foreign companies.
Backlog and Productive Capacity
Backlog orders are not typically significant in the business of any Reportable Segment since there is normally a short period of time
between the placing of an order and shipment. During 2021, we experienced raw material shortages, labor constraints, and weather-
related shutdowns that impacted our production and ability to meet customer orders. We believe that sufficient productive capacity
currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products during 2022.
Competition
We experience competition from many local, regional, national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture,
distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint, coatings and
related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our
different products and markets.
In The Americas Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent
hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product
line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.
In the Consumer Brands Group, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private-
label paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise,
distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment.
The Performance Coatings Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and
several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment include technology, product quality, product
innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price.
The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in
which this segment owns property. The main competitive factors are the availability of property and price.
Human Capital Resources
We believe our people are central to the foundation and future of the Company’s success. Our culture and commitment to our
people are important factors in attracting, retaining, developing and progressing qualified talent. At December 31, 2021, we
employed 61,626 people worldwide, of which 78% were in the United States and 22% were in other global regions.
Purpose and Culture. Our commitment to our people is embedded in our corporate purpose and guiding values. Our purpose is to
inspire and improve the world by coloring and protecting what matters. We fulfill this purpose through the development,
manufacture, distribution and sale of innovative paint and coatings products, striving to deliver benefits for all major stakeholders,
including our employees. The Company’s seven guiding values — integrity, people, service, quality, performance, innovation and
growth — influence how we fulfill our purpose, emphasize our commitment to our people and serve as the foundation of our
culture of excellence. We value and support our people through, among other initiatives, our inclusion, diversity and equity, talent
acquisition, employee engagement, and occupational health and safety initiatives, and our employment practices and total rewards
programs.
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity. We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion where differences are welcomed, appreciated
and celebrated to positively impact our people and business. Reflected in the Company’s Code of Conduct and reinforced through
our actions, training and attitudes, fostering an inclusive culture is a moral and business imperative. The building blocks of our
inclusion, diversity and equity strategy include:
•Educate and communicate to drive success: Building awareness of inclusive leadership behaviors to leverage the unique
contributions of each employee to positively impact our people and business results.
•Fill the pipeline with the best talent: Attracting the best talent pool that reflects the diversity of the communities in which
we serve and do business.
•Develop and engage talent by investing in our people: Investing in our people by providing networking and learning
opportunities to drive retention, progression and engagement.
•Progress talent by embedding equity into talent planning: Embedding equity into talent practices, processes, tools and
resources at all levels.

Our continuous efforts to create a supportive, welcoming environment across our global footprint is the shared responsibility of all
employees, including our senior leaders. Our senior leaders attend an inclusion, diversity and equity learning session to assist us in
maintaining our commitment to leading with inclusion and embracing and leveraging the diversity of our workforce.
Talent Acquisition and Employee Engagement. We are committed to providing our people with opportunities to learn, grow and be
recognized for their achievements. Through our integrated talent management strategy, we strive to attract, retain, develop and
progress a workforce that embraces our culture of inclusion and reflects our diversity efforts. The Company’s early talent programs,
including our management trainee program, play a critical role in attracting and progressing a diverse pipeline of talent. During
2021, we hired approximately 1,400 talented people through our management trainee program as part of our long-term growth
initiatives.
We are also committed to investing in our people by providing learning and employee networking opportunities to drive retention,
progression and engagement and help them excel in their current and future roles. During 2021, our employees completed
thousands of hours of online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories, including leadership, inclusion, diversity
and equity, professional skills, technical and compliance.
Occupational Health and Safety. We are committed to providing safe and healthy working environments for our employees. We
have a continued focus on Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) excellence that involves enhancing employee health and safety,
process safety, occupational health and taking reasonable preventative measures to reduce workplace injuries to protect the health
and safety of our employees. We strive for incident-free workplaces — continuously assessing and developing the programs that
are in place to help keep our employees, customers and communities safe.
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have implemented significant modifications to our health and safety programs, which were
designed to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers from COVID-19. These efforts have included, but
are not limited to: requiring social distancing; permitting remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible;
enhancing cleaning and sanitation procedures; restricting domestic and international travel; developing return to work and visitor
screening protocols; and postponing or cancelling the hosting or attending of large events.
Employment Practices and Total Rewards. We are committed to the fair, consistent and equitable treatment of our employees in
relation to working conditions, wages, benefits, policies and procedures. To this end, the Company’s policies and programs are
designed to respond to the needs of our employees in a manner that provides a safe, professional, efficient and rewarding
workplace. Our total rewards programs are designed to offer competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits and other
programs to support employees’ growth, both personally and professionally, and the diverse needs and well-being of our employees
worldwide.
Over the past two years, we enhanced certain of the Company’s benefits and practices to support the health and well-being of our
employees through the challenges of the pandemic and significant supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri and
Hurricane Ida — two natural disasters that occurred during 2021. Our enhanced benefits have included tele-health, paid sick leave,
family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs. We also have rewarded our employees’ resiliency and hard
work and made changes in our business to encourage retention, including wage increases, reduced store hours and employee
benefits enhancements.

included within Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
The risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission could
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. Although the risks are
organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. Readers should not interpret the disclosure of
any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.
ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC RISKS
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition, and the
continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly unpredictable and could adversely impact our business, results of
operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition in the future.
Our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition have been, and may be in the future, adversely affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts resulting from efforts by public health and governmental authorities to contain and
combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have made changes in our business designed to
support these efforts and protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers. The changes in our business have
included: temporarily reducing store hours and closing our sales floors in our company-operated paint stores to the general public;
requiring our customers to order product online or via phone and to access their products via curbside pickup or delivery;
implementing remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible; enhancing cleaning and sanitation procedures;
implementing domestic and international travel restrictions and return to work and visitor screening protocols; postponing or
canceling the hosting or attending of large events; and enhancing certain employee benefits, such as telehealth, paid sick leave,
family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs. We continue to evaluate the changes we have made in our
business, consider new and further changes, and work with public health, government and other authorities and organizations to
maintain our operations and support the health and well-being of our employees, customers and their families.
The necessary and appropriate measures we have taken have resulted in additional costs, including for COVID-related leave and
healthcare costs, and have adversely impacted our business and financial performance. As the pandemic continues and evolves, we
may incur additional costs and experience further adverse impacts to our business, each of which may be significant. We also have
faced, and may continue to face, operational risks in connection with remote and hybrid in-office work arrangements, including but
not limited to cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to damage or interruption resulting from, among other causes, cyber
attacks, security breaches, phishing, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages or system failures.
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and
created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, all of which may continue, and all of which have adversely
affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business. We have experienced occasional, temporary disruptions and closures
of some of our facilities, including more recently in connection with the Omicron variant and due to our employees or their family
members testing positive for COVID-19. We also have seen shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences, as well as impacts in the
demand for some of our products. While demand levels for our products have been returning to more normalized levels, our ability
to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products due to the impacts of the pandemic remains uncertain.
While we continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our
results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near-term and long-term
business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain
and which we cannot predict or control, and some of which we are not currently aware, including, but not limited to: (a) the
duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including additional variants and waves of COVID-19 cases; (b) rapidly-changing
governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak, including with respect to COVID-19 vaccination and
testing requirements, and the duration, degree, effectiveness and easing, removal or reinstitution of directives; (c) the further
development, availability, effectiveness and distribution of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines; (d) the extent and duration of the
pandemic’s adverse and/or volatile effects on economic and social activity, supply chain logistics, inflationary pressures, consumer
confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor and healthcare costs, labor markets and unemployment rates, any of
which may reduce demand for some of our products, impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for
our products, or impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us; (e) our ability to sell,
provide and meet the demand for our services and products, including as a result of new, or the reinstitution of prior, directives; (f)
any temporary reduction in our workforce or closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain
our operations, including as a result of employees or their family members testing positive for COVID-19; (g) the ability of our
customers and suppliers to continue their operations, which could affect our ability to sell, provide and meet the demand for our
services and products and result in terminations of contracts, losses of
6
Table of Contents
revenue and adverse effects to our supply chain; and (h) any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be
recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions. If the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or
financial markets or impacts our credit ratings in the future, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms
and continue to meet our liquidity needs.
Given the inherent uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, the pandemic may continue to create challenging operating environments
and may have an adverse impact on our business in the near term. If these conditions persist or worsen for a prolonged period, the
COVID-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, may also have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition.
Adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our
results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
Our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions. Adverse changes in such conditions in the
United States and worldwide, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may reduce the demand for some of our products,
adversely impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products, and impair the ability of those
with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash
flow, liquidity or financial condition. Higher inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates and unemployment rates, higher labor and
healthcare costs, recessions, changing governmental policies, laws and regulations, business disruptions due to cybersecurity
incidents, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), impacts of climate
change, fires or other natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for
some of our products, our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products, the availability, delivery or
cost of raw materials, our ability to adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and our results of operations, cash
flow, liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.
Protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our
products and adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.
Portions of our business involve the sale of paint, coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in
nature, particularly segments relating to construction, housing, manufacturing and oil production, refining, storage and
transportation. Our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these
segments. During economic downturns in these segments, the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may
decrease, and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy. This decrease in spending likely
will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.
Although interest rates remain low by historical standards, any increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential
homes, existing home turnover and new non-residential construction. A worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for
some of our products and may adversely impact sales, earnings and cash flow.
In the U.S. construction and housing segments, the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a
shortage of skilled workers, resulting in related project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our
products. While we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future, this labor shortage
may adversely impact our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.
FINANCIAL RISKS
A weakening of global credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
A weakening of global credit markets could adversely impact our net sales, the collection of accounts receivable, funding for
working capital needs, expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, access to capital and our investments,
which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
We finance a portion of our sales through trade credit. Credit markets remain tight, and some customers who require financing for
their businesses have not been able to obtain, and may in the future have difficulty obtaining, necessary financing. A continuation
or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results
of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
We generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through
short-term borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities. If any of the banks in these credit and
financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments, such inability could adversely impact our cash flow, liquidity or
financial condition, including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.

Table of Contents
Although we have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs, we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our
existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary. Our cost of borrowing and ability to access the
capital markets are affected not only by market conditions, but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit
rating agencies. Downgrades in these ratings, including due to uncertainties regarding COVID-19, likely would increase our cost of
borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including our access to the commercial paper
market. An inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow,
liquidity or financial condition.
We have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying
value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be
recoverable. An impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of
market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change
our estimates of future sales and cash flow, resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect
our results of operations or financial condition.
We hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans. A decrease in the value of plan
assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance, which may
adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
We require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding. Our ability to generate
cash depends on many factors beyond our control. We also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs.
If we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness.
At December 31, 2021, we had total debt of approximately $9.615 billion, which is an increase of $1.323 billion since
December 31, 2020. We have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.
Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on
our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate our future financial results
will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, including public health crises, such as the COVID-19
pandemic, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as due to the impacts of climate change, supply chain disruptions
and related impacts. We cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings
will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make
planned capital expenditures.
The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders. For example, it could:
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing
the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other long-term
growth initiatives and general corporate purposes;
•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;
•limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or
economic or industry conditions; or
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.
Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which,
if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.
A significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to generate sufficient cash
flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the
form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Our subsidiaries are separate and
distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet
our cash flow needs, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. Further, any payment of dividends,
loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries
will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our
subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors,
including trade creditors. Even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any
security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us. Finally, changes
in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to
repatriate funds to us.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or
financial condition.
Because of our international operations, we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign
currencies, which may adversely affect our business. Historically, our reported net sales, earnings, cash flow and financial condition
have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Chinese
yuan, the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, the British pound, and the Mexican peso, each against the U.S. dollar. While we
actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy, we believe we
may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and such losses could adversely affect our sales, earnings,
cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including due to the impacts of climate change, may temporarily reduce the
demand for some of our products, impact our ability to meet the demand for our products or cause supply chain disruptions and
increased costs, and could have a negative effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.
Our business is seasonal in nature, with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings
than other quarters. From time to time, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including due to the impacts of climate
change, have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales, manufacture and distribution of paint, coatings and related products.
In the event adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster cause significant damage to any one or more of our principal
manufacturing or distribution facilities, we may not be able to manufacture the products needed to meet customer demand, which
could have an adverse effect on our sales of certain paint, coatings and related products.
The impact of these risks to our suppliers also have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales, manufacture and distribution of
certain of our products. During 2021, Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida caused significant damage to certain of our suppliers’
facilities in Texas and Louisiana, respectively. These natural disasters and their impacts to certain of our suppliers resulted in
unprecedented industry-wide supply chain disruptions, increased raw material and other costs, and significantly hindered our ability
to manufacture the products needed to fully meet customer demand. We discuss these natural disasters and their adverse impact to
our business in more detail in the “Outlook” section in Item 7.
In any of these instances, an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow.
Unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.
We purchase raw materials (including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene and ethylene) and
energy for use in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Factors such as political instability, higher tariffs, supply
chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters (including hurricanes and severe winter or other storms due to
the impacts of climate change) or public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic) could disrupt the availability of raw
material and fuel supplies, adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands for some of our products or adequately staff and
maintain operations at affected facilities and increase our costs. In addition, environmental and social regulations, including
regulations related to climate change, may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials,
as well as sources and supply of energy. Although raw materials and energy supplies (including oil and natural gas) are generally
available from various sources in sufficient quantities, unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy,
or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers, may have an adverse effect on our earnings
or cash flow. In the event we experience supply chain disruptions from our suppliers, we may not be able to timely secure alternate
sources in order to prevent significant impacts to our business, or we may experience quality issues with raw materials and energy
sourced from alternate sources. If the cost of raw materials and energy increases, we may not be able to offset higher costs in a
timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products. In recent years, some raw
material and energy prices have increased, particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene
and ethylene, as well as metal and plastic packaging.
The cost of raw materials and energy could continue to experience periods of volatility in the future and may adversely affect our
earnings and cash flow.
Although we have an extensive customer base, the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales, earnings
or cash flow.
We have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution platform. During 2021, no individual customer
accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales. However, we have some customers that, individually, purchase a
large amount of products from us. Although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one
customer, the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.

Table of Contents
Increased competition or failure to keep pace with developments in key competitive areas of our business may reduce our sales,
earnings or cash flow performance.
We face substantial competition from many international, national, regional and local competitors of various sizes in the
manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. Some of our competitors operate more extensively in
certain regions around the world and have greater financial or operational resources to compete internationally. Other competitors
are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product
line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are key competitive factors for our business. Competition in any of these
areas, or failure to keep pace with developments in any of these areas, may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or
cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing, distributing and selling our
products.
Our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future
acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations.
We have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and likely will acquire additional
businesses in the future as part of our long-term growth strategy. The success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our
ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the
acquisitions, particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets. In the event we do not successfully
integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment, our results of
operations, cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected.
Risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in Asia, Europe, South America and other
foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
Net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 21.2%, 19.5% and 20.6% of our total consolidated
net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales outside of the United States make up a significant part of our current business
and future strategic plans. Our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a
variety of domestic and international factors, including general economic conditions, political instability, inflation rates, recessions,
tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange controls, interest rates, foreign investment and repatriation
restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints, civil unrest, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external
economic and political factors. In addition, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic) in foreign jurisdictions may
temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect the availability and cost of raw materials. Our
inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of
operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
In many foreign countries, it is not uncommon to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because
of regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. Recent years have seen a
substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement
proceedings by both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and
individuals. Although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations, there
can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations. Any violation could cause an adverse
effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
Policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.
Due to the international scope of our operations, changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the
demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell
products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, which may include the United States-Mexico-
Canada Agreement, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of
more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange
controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow
and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.
Additionally, the results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on European Union membership, which resulted in the United
Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), caused significant volatility in global stock markets,
currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. The transition period post-Brexit expired on December 31,
2020, and the United Kingdom and European Union entered into a free trade agreement that now governs the United Kingdom’s
relationship with the European Union. While the United Kingdom and European Union generally have continued to trade with each
other without the imposition of tariffs for imports and exports, trades have been subject to new customs
10
Table of Contents
requirements that require additional documentation and data and new controls on the movement and reporting of goods (including
chemicals). Although we have not experienced any material disruption in our business as a result of Brexit to date, we do not know
the extent to which Brexit and the free trade agreement will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the
United Kingdom, the rest of the European Union or other countries, although it is possible there will be tighter controls and
administrative requirements for imports and exports between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries, as
well as increased regulatory complexities, as the transition continues. Any of these factors could adversely impact customer
demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.
Cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology systems could interfere with our operations, result
in the compromise or loss of critical and confidential information and severely harm our business.
We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, including recording and processing transactions,
manufacturing and selling our products, researching and developing new products, maintaining and growing our competitive
position, and supporting and communicating with our employees, customers, suppliers and other vendors. These information
technology systems are important to many business-critical processes including, but not limited to, production planning,
manufacturing, finance, company operations, sales and customer service. Some of these systems are maintained or operated by
third-party providers. Despite our efforts to prevent disruptions to these information technology systems, these systems may be
affected by damage or interruption resulting from, among other causes, cyber attacks, security breaches, phishing, malware,
viruses, ransomware, power outages or system failures. These risks could be magnified due to the increased reliance on information
technology systems to conduct our business, including those used in furtherance of remote and hybrid in-office work environments.
Disruptions to these systems may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
As part of our business, we collect and handle sensitive and confidential information about our business, customers, employees and
suppliers. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those third parties with which we do
business, may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, security breaches, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages, system failures, acts
of vandalism or misconduct, human or technical errors or other similar events or disruptions. Any such event involving the
misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of information, whether impacting us or third parties with which we do
business, could result in losses, damage our reputation or relationships with customers and suppliers, expose us to the risks of
litigation, regulatory action and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. We continue to mitigate these risks in a number of ways, including through additional
investment, engagement of third-party experts and consultants, improving the security of our facilities and systems, providing
annual training for all employees (with more enhanced or frequent training based on role), assessing the continued appropriateness
of relevant insurance coverage and strengthening our controls to monitor and mitigate these threats.
The domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security, collection and privacy is increasingly
rigorous and complex, with new and rapidly changing requirements applicable to our business. Compliance with these
requirements, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and other
international and domestic regulations, could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices.
Our ability to attract, retain, develop and progress a qualified workforce could adversely impact our business and impair our
ability to meet our strategic objectives and the needs of our customers.
Our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify, attract and onboard qualified candidates with the requisite
education, background, skills and experience and our ability to retain, develop, progress and engage qualified employees across our
business, including our stores, fleet, manufacturing, corporate and other operations and functions. Competition for talent is intense,
and we are facing increased wage rates and labor shortages due to a tightened labor market and other macroeconomic conditions
that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent we are unable to remain competitive with our compensation
and benefits, talent management strategy, inclusive workplace culture and related initiatives, programs and practices, or if qualified
candidates or employees become more difficult to attract or retain under reasonable terms, we may experience higher labor-related
costs and may be unable to attract, retain, develop and progress a qualified workforce, which could adversely affect our business
and future success and impair our ability to meet our strategic objectives and the needs of our customers.
Inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our
business.
We have numerous patents, trade secrets, trademarks, trade names and know-how that are valuable to our business. Despite our
efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure, third parties may
attempt to disclose, obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization.
Although we rely on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect our
intellectual property rights, the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as
11
Table of Contents
the laws of the United States. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, the failure of foreign countries to have
laws to protect our intellectual property rights, or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an
adverse effect on our business.
LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS
We are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, for which compliance could
adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
We are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including
securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, data
privacy and security laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and
changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. From time to time, our Company, our
operations and the industries in which we operate may be reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement
actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.
Although we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks, the global
and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist. Investigations, examinations and other
proceedings, the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted, likely will arise from time to time. These investigations,
examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay
significant settlements, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or
financial condition.
We are subject to tax laws and regulations in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. We are affected by changes in tax
laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance. In the ordinary course of our business, we
are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators. In addition to existing examinations
and investigations, there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future, and existing examinations and
investigations could be expanded.
For non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and
reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments
may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency. In the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be
significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In
those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated,
any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid. For
income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being
sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. For those
income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50% likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not
recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. Subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of
sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or
financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid.
We discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8.
We are required to comply with, and may become subject to additional, numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic
and foreign health, safety and environmental (including related to climate change) laws, regulations and requirements, the cost
of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
Our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental laws, regulations and requirements,
including those related to chemicals, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. These laws, regulations and requirements not
only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations.
Increased global focus on climate change may result in the imposition of new or additional regulations or requirements applicable
to, and increased financial risks for, our business and industry. A number of government authorities and agencies have introduced or
are contemplating regulatory changes to address climate change, including the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The
outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional
requirements, including to fund energy efficiency activities or renewable energy use, and fees or restrictions
12
Table of Contents
on certain activities or materials. Compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us,
including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, additional investments in renewable energy use and
other initiatives, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. We may not be able to timely
recover the cost of compliance with such new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our results of
operations, cash flow or financial condition.
We expect health, safety and additional environmental laws, regulations and requirements to be increasingly stringent upon our
industry and us in the future. Our costs to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements may increase as they become more
stringent in the future, and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
We are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently- and formerly-owned sites,
as well as a number of third-party sites, for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued.
We are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently- and formerly-owned sites
and a number of third-party sites. We accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which
commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards
and professional judgment. These estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site. We continuously assess
our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmental-related accruals as information
becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainties surrounding
environmental investigation and remediation activities, our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently
accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings. We discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail in the
“Environmental-Related Liabilities” and “Environmental Matters” sections in Item 7 and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.
The nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation, such as litigation arising from the historical
manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.
In the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to
product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental (including natural resource damages), intellectual property,
commercial, contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to
us. These uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence
of a liability or the reduction of a liability. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic of the ASC, we accrue for these
contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly
higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In those cases
where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be
reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued.
Our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. Along with other companies, we are
and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings, including individual personal injury actions, purported class actions
and actions brought by various counties, cities, school districts and other government-related entities, arising from the manufacture
and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. The plaintiffs’ claims have been based upon various legal theories, including
negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentations and
omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy, violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws, enterprise liability,
market share liability, public nuisance, unjust enrichment and other theories. The plaintiffs seek various damages and relief,
including personal injury and property damage, costs relating to the detection and abatement of lead-based paint from buildings,
costs associated with a public education campaign, medical monitoring costs and others. We have also been a defendant in legal
proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of non-lead-based paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories,
including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint
on surfaces previously painted with lead-based paint. We believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to
meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation. We expect additional lead pigment and lead-based paint
litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of
damages and relief. The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional lead pigment and lead-based paint
litigation that may be filed, including utilizing all avenues of appeal, if necessary.
13
Table of Contents
Notwithstanding our views on the merits, litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties, and we ultimately may not prevail.
Adverse court rulings or determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect the lead pigment and lead-based paint
litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings. From time to time,
various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted, promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and
former manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or
to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful.
Due to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation,
the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings, or the effect any legislation and/or administrative regulations may
have on the litigation or against us. Further, management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs
and liabilities related to such litigation, or resulting from any such legislation and regulations. Except with respect to the California
public nuisance litigation, we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss
has occurred, and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon
which an estimate could be based. In addition, any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations
cannot reasonably be estimated. Due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any
other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such
litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. We discuss the
risks and uncertainties related to litigation, including the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, in more detail in Note 10 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
(dollars in millions, except as noted and per share data)
Company Background
The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866, and its consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) are
engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial,
commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America with additional operations in the Caribbean region and
throughout Europe, Asia and Australia.
The Company is structured into three reportable segments – The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance
Coatings Group (collectively, the Reportable Segments) – and an Administrative segment in the same way it is internally organized
for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Company’s Reportable Segments.
Summary
•Consolidated net sales increased 8.6% in the year to a record $19.94 billion
◦Net sales from stores in U.S. and Canada open more than twelve calendar months increased 6.0% in the year
◦Raw material availability issues negatively impacted full year sales by a mid-single digit percentage
•Diluted net income per share decreased to $6.98 per share in the year compared to $7.36 per share in the full year 2020
◦Adjusted diluted net income per share decreased to $8.15 per share in the year compared to $8.19 per share in the
full year 2020
•Completed a three-for-one stock split to improve accessibility to a broader base of investors
•Finalized the divestiture of our Wattyl business in Australia and New Zealand
•Continued to invest in acquisitions expanding our product offerings and manufacturing capacity
Outlook
The Company navigated many uncertainties during 2021, including unprecedented raw material inflation, industry-wide supply
chain disruptions, as well as temporary changes in the demand for our products due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
earlier in the year and the Omicron variant later in the year. Despite the uncertainties, our businesses continue to be well-positioned,
and we have confidence in our long-term outlook.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and disrupt normal activities in many segments of the global economy. We continue
to work with government and health authorities to operate our business, including our company-operated stores, manufacturing
plants and other facilities. We also continue to follow recommended actions of government authorities and health officials in order
to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and their families worldwide.
As we look to 2022, we are encouraged by the demand environment, which remains robust across our end markets. Our customers
remain positive, and we expect that jobs delayed by raw material availability issues in 2021 will be completed in the quarters ahead
rather than cancelled. We brought on 50 million gallons of incremental architectural paint production capacity in 2021 to meet this
demand and will continue to add paint stores in 2022. We expect raw material availability to continue improving. We are
implementing additional price increases to offset to the sustained cost inflation and expect raw material costs will ultimately
moderate, enabling the recovery of our margins over time.
We intend to remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach, focused on driving value for our customers and returns for our
shareholders. Capital expenditures, excluding our new global headquarters, will remain modest at approximately 2 percent of sales
and we will continue to pursue acquisitions that fit our strategy. We expect to use any excess cash to make open market purchases
of Company stock. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect debt to EBITDA to approach the high end of our target of 2.0
to 2.5 times range.
Please see Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the current and
potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of supply chain disruptions and raw material inflation on the
Company.

Common Stock Split
During the first quarter of 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and declared a three-for-one stock split to
shareholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2021 (the Stock Split). The Stock Split was effected on March 31,
2021. All share and per share information herein has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis addresses comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, see Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed on February 19, 2021.
Net Sales
Year Ended December 31,
2021 2020 $ Change % Change
Net Sales:
The Americas Group $ 11,217.0 $ 10,383.2 $ 833.8 8.0 %
Consumer Brands Group 2,721.6 3,053.4 (331.8) (10.9)%
Performance Coatings Group 6,003.8 4,922.4 1,081.4 22.0 %
Administrative 2.2 2.7 (0.5) (18.5)%
Total $ 19,944.6 $ 18,361.7 $ 1,582.9 8.6 %
Consolidated net sales for 2021 increased due primarily to selling price increases in all Reportable Segments and higher product
sales volume in the Performance Coatings Group, partially offset by lower sales volume in the Consumer Brands Group. Currency
translation rate changes increased 2021 consolidated net sales by 0.8%. Net sales of all consolidated foreign subsidiaries increased
17.9% to $4.223 billion for 2021 versus $3.581 billion for 2020 due primarily to returning demand in most industrial end markets
globally. Net sales of all operations other than consolidated foreign subsidiaries increased 6.4% to $15.722 billion for 2021 versus
$14.781 billion for 2020.
Net sales in The Americas Group increased due primarily to selling price increases in all end markets, while sales volume remained
flat as a result of raw material availability challenges. Net sales from stores in U.S. and Canada open for more than twelve calendar
months increased 6.0% in the year over last year’s comparable period. Currency translation rate changes reduced net sales by 0.1%
compared to 2020. During 2021, The Americas Group opened 92 new stores and closed 7 redundant locations for a net increase of
85 stores, with a net increase of 73 new stores in the U.S. and Canada. The total number of stores in operation at December 31,
2021 was 4,859 in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. The Americas Group’s objective is to expand its
store base an average of 2% each year, primarily through organic growth. Sales of products other than paint increased
approximately 12.5% over last year. A discussion of changes in volume versus pricing for sales of products other than paint is not
pertinent due to the wide assortment of general merchandise sold.
Net sales of the Consumer Brands Group decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower volume sales to most of the group’s retail
customers as DIY demand returned to more normal levels, raw material availability issues, and the Wattyl divestiture, partially
offset by selling price increases. In 2022, the Consumer Brands Group is focused on meeting customer needs through product
development, building inventory, and optimizing the product assortment at existing customers.
The Performance Coatings Group’s net sales in 2021 increased due primarily to higher sales volumes in most end markets and
selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes increased net sales 2.2% compared to 2020. At December 31, 2021, the
Performance Coatings Group had 282 branches open in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe and Asia. In
2022, the Performance Coatings Group plans to continue expanding its worldwide presence, including improving its customer base
and product offering.
Net sales in the Administrative segment, which primarily consists of external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space and
leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary business, decreased by an insignificant amount in 2021.

Income before income taxes $ 2,248.6 11.3 %$ 2,519.2 13.7 %
Consolidated cost of goods sold increased $1.723 billion, or 17.8% in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to
higher raw material costs (including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources) and unfavorable currency translation
rate changes, partially offset by lower sales volumes primarily as a result of raw material availability issues during the second half
of 2021. Currency translation rate changes increased Cost of goods sold by 1.1% in the current year.
Consolidated gross profit decreased $139.9 million in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Consolidated gross profit as a
percent to consolidated net sales decreased to 42.8% in 2021 from 47.3% in 2020. Consolidated gross profit dollars decreased
primarily due to higher raw material costs in each Reportable Segment and lower sales volume in the Consumer Brands Group,
partially offset by selling price increases in each Reportable Segment as well as higher sales volume in The Performance Coatings
Group and The Americas Group. The gross margin rate decreased primarily as a result of higher raw material costs in each
Reportable Segment.
The Americas Group’s gross profit for 2021 increased $134.7 million compared to the same period in 2020. The Americas Group’s
gross profit dollars increased primarily as a result of selling price increases, partially offset by higher raw material costs. The
America’s Group gross margin rate decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs. The Consumer Brands Group’s gross
profit decreased $327.8 million in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The Consumer Brands Group’s gross profit dollars
and margin rate decreased primarily as a result of lower sales volume, the Wattyl divestiture, higher raw material costs and supply
chain inefficiencies. The Performance Coatings Group’s gross profit for 2021 increased $58.6 million compared to the same period
in 2020. The Performance Coatings Group’s gross profit dollars increased due to higher sales and favorable currency translation
rate changes, partially offset by higher raw material costs. The Performance Coatings Group’s gross margin rate decreased
primarily due to higher raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales volumes and selling price increases.
Consolidated SG&A increased by $94.6 million due primarily to increased expenses to support higher sales levels and net new
store openings, partially offset by good cost control. As a percent of net sales, SG&A decreased 190 basis points compared to the
same period in 2020 as a result of good cost control, partially offset by increased spending from new store openings and costs to
support higher sales levels.
The Americas Group’s SG&A increased $196.3 million for the year due primarily to increased spending from new store openings
and costs to support higher sales levels, including the hiring of additional sales representatives. The Consumer Brands Group’s
SG&A decreased by $104.9 million for the year primarily due to good sales and marketing cost control in line with a return to more
normal DIY sales levels. The Performance Coatings Group’s SG&A increased by $75.4 million for the year primarily to support
higher sales levels and unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by good cost control. The Administrative
segment’s SG&A decreased $72.2 million primarily due to lower compensation, including incentive compensation.

Table of Contents
Other general expense - net increased $74.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the
recognition of a $111.9 million loss on the Wattyl divestiture in March 2021, partially offset by a $41.1 million decrease in
provisions for environmental matters in the Administrative segment. See Notes 3, 9 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 for additional information concerning the Wattyl divestiture, environmental matters and Other general expense
- net, respectively.
For information on the amortization of acquired intangible assets and related impairment considerations, see Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Interest expense decreased $5.7 million in 2021 primarily due to lower expense associated with short-term borrowings. See Note 6
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Company’s outstanding debt.
Other (income) expense - net improved $24.8 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the $21.3 million loss recognized
upon extinguishment of debt in 2020 in the Administrative segment. See Notes 6 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 for additional information related to debt and Other (income) expense - net, respectively.

Income Tax Expense
The effective income tax rate for 2021 was 17.1% compared to 19.4% in 2020. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily due
to an increase in tax benefits related to employee share-based payments and the net favorable impact of various other tax benefits
received by the Company in the current year. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional
information.
Net Income Per Share
Diluted net income per share for 2021 decreased to $6.98 per share from $7.36 per share for 2020. Diluted net income per share in
2021 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.83 per share and a $0.34 per share loss from the Wattyl divestiture.
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding the Wattyl divestiture. Currency
translation rate changes decreased diluted net income per share in the year by $0.05 per share.
Diluted net income per share in 2020 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.83 per share.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW
Overview
The Company’s financial condition, liquidity and cash flow continued to be strong in 2021. The Company generated $2.245 billion
in net operating cash despite ongoing and industry-wide raw material availability issues which negatively impacted total sales and
gross margins. The net operating cash generation was primarily attributable to operating results as consolidated income before
income taxes was $2.249 billion or 11.3% of net sales. The strong cash generation, along with an increase in our short-term
borrowings and long-term debt, allowed the Company to invest $372.0 million in capital expenditures and return $3.339 billion to
shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks during the year.
During 2021, the Company generated EBITDA of $3.156 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.268 billion. See the Non-GAAP
Financial Measures section in Item 7 for definition and calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2021,
the Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $165.7 million and total debt outstanding of $9.615 billion. Total debt, net of Cash
and cash equivalents, was $9.449 billion and was 2.9 times the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA in 2021.
Net Working Capital
Net working capital, defined as Total current assets less Total current liabilities, decreased $662.8 million to a deficit of $665.8
million at December 31, 2021 from a deficit of $3.0 million at December 31, 2020. The net working capital decrease is due to an
increase in current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in current assets.
Comparing current asset balances at December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020, Accounts receivable increased $274.3 million due
to higher sales, Inventories increased $123.1 million due to higher raw material costs, and Other current assets increased $125.8
million primarily related to refundable income taxes and prepaid expenses.
Current liability balances increased $1.125 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 primarily due to a $763.4
million increase in Short-term borrowings and $235.5 million increase in the Current portion of long-term debt. Excluding Short-
term borrowings and the Current portion of long-term debt, current liabilities increased $126.2 million primarily due to the timing
of payments related to accounts payable, partially offset by lower accruals, including compensation.
As a result of the net effect of these changes, the Company’s current ratio decreased to 0.88 at December 31, 2021 from 1.00 at
December 31, 2020. Accounts receivable as a percent of net sales increased to 11.8% in 2021 from 11.3% in 2020. Accounts
receivable days outstanding remained unchanged at 57 days in 2021. In 2021, provisions for allowance for doubtful collection of
accounts decreased $4.6 million, or 8.6%. Inventories as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.7% in 2021 from 9.8% in 2020.
Inventory days outstanding was 75 days in 2021 compared to 74 days in 2020. The Company has sufficient total available
borrowing capacity to fund its current operating needs.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Net property, plant and equipment increased $32.8 million to $1.867 billion at December 31, 2021 due primarily to capital
expenditures of $372.0 million, assets acquired through business combinations of $33.5 million, partially offset by depreciation
expense of $263.1 million, sale or disposition of assets with remaining net book value of $53.1 million, and other adjustments of
$56.5 million, which includes government incentives associated with the construction of our new global headquarters (new
headquarters) in downtown Cleveland, Ohio and new research and development (R&D) center in the Cleveland suburb of
Brecksville and currency translation.
Capital expenditures during 2021 in The Americas Group were primarily attributable to the opening of new paint stores and
renovation and improvements in existing stores. In the Consumer Brands Group and the Performance Coatings Group, capital
expenditures during 2021 were primarily attributable to operational efficiencies, capacity, health and safety at sites currently in
operation. The Administrative segment incurred capital expenditures primarily related to construction activities associated with the
new headquarters and new R&D center. The Company has committed to spend a minimum of $600 million of capital expenditures
to build both the new headquarters and R&D center. Construction on the new headquarters and R&D center is expected to continue
in 2022, with completion in 2024 at the earliest. The Company has not made any decisions regarding the disposition of the
Company’s current Cleveland-area headquarters and R&D centers, which are all owned by the Company.
In 2022, the Company expects to spend more than 2021 for capital expenditures. The predominant share of the capital expenditures
in 2022 is expected to be for various productivity improvement and maintenance projects at existing manufacturing, distribution
and research and development facilities, new store openings, new or upgraded information systems hardware and the new
headquarters and R&D center in Ohio. The Company does not anticipate the need for any specific long-term external financing to
support these capital expenditures.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in purchase business combinations,
increased $85.5 million in 2021 primarily due to incremental goodwill recognized in 2021 acquisitions of $155.6 million, partially
offset by foreign currency translation rate fluctuations and the Wattyl divestiture.
Intangible assets decreased $469.7 million in 2021 primarily due to amortization of finite-lived intangible assets of $309.5 million,
dispositions of $148.5 million primarily related to Wattyl divestiture, and foreign currency translation rate fluctuations of $37.2
million, partially offset by finite-lived intangible assets recognized in 2021 through acquisitions of $25.5 million.
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a description of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and asset
impairments recognized in accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC and summaries of the remaining
carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets.
Other Assets
Other assets increased $94.7 million to $789.0 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to incremental
deposits and investments (including an increase in deferred pension assets), partially offset by the sale of investments to fund the
Company’s domestic defined contribution plan. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional
information related to the domestic defined contribution plan.
Debt (including Short-term borrowings)
December 31, December 31,
2021 2020
Long-term debt $ 8,851.5 $ 8,292.0 
Short-term borrowings 763.5 0.1 
Total debt outstanding $ 9,615.0 $ 8,292.1 
Total debt including Short-term borrowings increased by $1.323 billion to $9.615 billion in 2021. Short-term borrowings are
primarily comprised of amounts outstanding under the Company’s domestic commercial paper program and various foreign credit
facilities. The Company’s long-term debt primarily consists of senior notes.
In November 2021, the Company issued $500.0 million of 2.20% Senior Notes due March 2032 and $500.0 million of 2.90%
Senior Notes due March 2052 in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay
outstanding borrowings under the Company’s domestic commercial paper program.
In October 2021, the Company redeemed the entire outstanding $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.20% Senior
Notes due 2022 and its 4.20% Notes due 2022 initially issued by The Valspar Corporation (collectively, the 4.20% Senior Notes)
after exercising its optional redemption rights. The 4.20% Senior Notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued interest, and resulted in a gain of $1.4 million recorded in Other (income) expense - net.
On June 29, 2021, the Company and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sherwin-Williams Canada Inc. (SW Canada) and
Sherwin-Williams Luxembourg S.à r.l. (SW Luxembourg, together with the Company and SW Canada, the Borrowers), entered into
a new five-year $2.000 billion credit agreement (New Credit Agreement). The New Credit Agreement may be used for general
corporate purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements. The New Credit Agreement replaced the $2.000
billion credit agreement dated July 19, 2018, as amended, which was terminated effective June 29, 2021. The New Credit
Agreement will mature on June 29, 2026 and provides that the Company may request to extend the maturity date of the facility for
two additional one-year periods. In addition, the New Credit Agreement provides that the Borrowers may increase the aggregate
amount of the facility to $2.750 billion, subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in the increase, and the Borrowers
may request letters of credit in an amount of up to $250.0 million. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no short-term
borrowings under these credit agreements.
On August 2, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated $625.0 million credit agreement (August 2021 Credit
Agreement), which amends and restates the five-year credit agreement entered into in September 2017. The August 2021 Credit
Agreement was subsequently amended on multiple dates to extend the maturity of commitments available for borrowing or letters
of credit under the agreement. On May 9, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (May 2016 Credit
Agreement), subsequently amended on multiple dates to extend the maturity of commitments available for borrowing or letters of
credit under the agreement. The May 2016 credit agreement gives the Company the right to borrow and obtain letters of
27
Table of Contents
credit up to an aggregate availability of $875.0 million. Both of these credit agreements are being used for general corporate
purposes. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements.
The Company’s available capacity under its committed credit agreements is reduced for amounts outstanding under its domestic
commercial paper program and letters of credit. At December 31, 2021, the Company had unused capacity under its various credit
agreements of $2.725 billion.
See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a detailed description and summary of the Company’s
outstanding debt, short-term borrowings and other available financing programs.
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
In accordance with the accounting prescribed by the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company’s total liability for
unfunded or underfunded defined benefit pension plans decreased $31.3 million to $79.0 million primarily due to changes in the
actuarial assumptions. The Company’s liability for other postretirement benefits decreased $15.2 million to $276.4 million at
December 31, 2021 due primarily to changes in the actuarial assumptions.
The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for domestic defined benefit pension plans was 3.1%
at December 31, 2021 and 2.9% at December 31, 2020. The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit
obligation for foreign defined benefit pension plans increased to 2.3% at December 31, 2021 from 1.6% at December 31, 2020. The
increase in the discount rates for both the domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans was primarily due to higher interest
rates. The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit obligations
increased to 2.8% at December 31, 2021 from 2.5% at December 31, 2020 for the same reason.
The rate of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations at December 31, 2021 was 3.0% for the
domestic pension plan and 3.3% for foreign pension plans, which was comparable to the rates used in the prior year. In deciding on
the rate of compensation increases, management considered historical Company increases as well as expectations for future
increases. The expected long-term rate of return on assets remained 5.0% at December 31, 2021 for the domestic pension plan and
was slightly lower for most foreign plans. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2021, management
considered the historical rates of return, the nature of investments and an expectation for future investment strategies. The assumed
health care cost trend rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits for 2021 were 5.1% and
8.3%, respectively, for medical and prescription drug cost increases, both decreasing gradually to 4.5% in 2029. In developing the
assumed health care cost trend rates, management considered industry data, historical Company experience and expectations for
future health care costs.
For 2022 net pension cost for the ongoing domestic pension plan, the Company will use a discount rate of 3.1%, an expected long-
term rate of return on assets of 5.0% and a rate of compensation increase of 3.0%. Lower discount rates and expected long-term
rates of return on plan assets will be used for most foreign plans. For 2022 net periodic benefit costs for other postretirement
benefits, the Company will use a discount rate of 2.8%. Net pension cost in 2022 for the ongoing domestic pension plan is expected
to be approximately $1.5 million. Net periodic benefit costs for other postretirement benefits in 2022 is expected to be
approximately $11.0 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on the
Company’s obligations and funded status of its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes at December 31, 2021 decreased $77.9 million from the prior year primarily due to the change in deferred
taxes as a result of the amortization of intangible assets in the current year. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 for additional information on deferred taxes.
Other Long-Term Liabilities
Other long-term liabilities increased $47.1 million during 2021 due primarily to an increase in long-term commitments related to
affordable housing and historic real estate properties, partially offset by the payment of U.S. federal payroll withholding taxes in
accordance with the terms of the legislatively authorized tax payment deferral mechanisms established in 2020.
Environmental-Related Liabilities
The operations of the Company, like those of other companies in the same industry, are subject to various federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products, but also impose
potential liability on the Company for past operations. Management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose
increasingly stringent requirements upon the Company and the industry in the future. Management believes that the Company
conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs
designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance. 
28
Table of Contents
Depreciation of capital expenditures and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were included in
the normal operating expenses of conducting business. The Company’s capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses
related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were not material to the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flow
or results of operations during 2021. Management does not expect that such capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses
will be material to the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flow or results of operations in 2022. See Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on environmental-related long-term liabilities.
Contractual and Other Obligations and Commercial Commitments
During 2021, the Company signed agreements related to various acquisitions, including related to the European industrial coatings
business of Sika AG (Sika). The Sika transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to Note 3 for additional
information. The Company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual and other
obligations and commercial commitments. The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities and borrowings
available under long-term and short-term debt, including its committed credit agreements and commercial paper program, will be
sufficient for it to meet its contractual and other obligations and commercial commitments. The following tables summarize such
obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021.

Warranties
The Company offers product warranties for certain products. The specific terms and conditions of such warranties vary depending
on the product or customer contract requirements. Management estimated the costs of unsettled product warranty claims based on
historical results and experience and included an amount in Other accruals. Management periodically assesses the adequacy of the
accrual for product warranty claims and adjusts the accrual as necessary. Changes in the Company’s accrual for product warranty
claims during 2021 and 2020, including customer satisfaction settlements during the year, were as follows:
2021 2020

Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity decreased $1.174 billion to $2.437 billion at December 31, 2021 from $3.611 billion last year. The decrease
was primarily attributable to the Company repurchasing $2.752 billion in Treasury stock and declaring $587.1 million in cash
dividends, partially offset by $1.864 billion of net income and an increase of $268.3 million associated with stock option exercises
and the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. See the Statements of Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity and Statements
of Consolidated Comprehensive Income in Item 8 for additional information.
The Company purchased 10.1 million shares of its common stock for treasury purposes through open market purchases during
2021. The Company acquires its common stock for general corporate purposes, and depending on its cash position and market
conditions, it may acquire shares in the future. On February 17, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase
an additional 45.0 million shares of the Company’s stock for treasury purposes. The Company had remaining authorization from its
Board of Directors at December 31, 2021 to purchase 48.6 million shares of its common stock.
The Company’s 2021 annual cash dividend of $2.20 per share represented 30% of 2020 diluted net income per share. The 2021
annual dividend represented the 43 consecutive year of increased dividend payments since the dividend was suspended in 1978.
On February 16, 2022, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.60 per share. This quarterly dividend, if
approved in each of the remaining quarters of 2022, would result in an annual dividend for 2022 of $2.40 per share or a 34% payout
of 2021 diluted net income per share.
Cash Flow
Net operating cash decreased $1.164 billion in 2021 to a cash source of $2.245 billion from $3.409 billion in 2020 due primarily to
incremental working capital requirements and a decrease in net income, partially offset by favorable changes in non-cash items
associated with the Wattyl divestiture and deferred taxes when compared to 2020. Net operating cash decreased as a percent to sales
to 11.3% in 2021 compared to 18.6% in 2020.
Net investing cash usage increased $154.0 million to a usage of $476.4 million in 2021 from a usage of $322.4 million in 2020 due
primarily to cash used for acquisitions and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by higher proceeds received from the
sale of businesses and assets (including the Wattyl divestiture). See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
additional information on acquisitions and divestitures.
Net financing cash usage decreased $1.186 billion to a usage of $1.834 billion in 2021 from a usage of $3.020 billion in 2020 due
primarily to $1.746 billion of incremental cash provided by short-term borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by an
increase of $405.1 million, or 13.8%, in cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks during the
year and lower proceeds from treasury stock issuances.
Litigation
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning litigation.
Market Risk
The Company is exposed to market risk associated with interest rate, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. The Company
occasionally utilizes derivative instruments as part of its overall financial risk management policy, but does not use derivative
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. In 2021 and 2020, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts
with maturity dates of less than twelve months primarily to hedge against value changes in foreign currency and cross currency
swap contracts to hedge its net investment in European operations. See Notes 1, 15 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 for additional information related to the Company’s use of derivative instruments.
The Company believes it may be exposed to continuing market risk from foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price
fluctuations. However, the Company does not expect that foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations or
hedging contract losses will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.
Financial Covenant
Certain borrowings contain a consolidated leverage covenant. The covenant states the Company’s leverage ratio is not to exceed
3.75 to 1.00. The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total indebtedness (the sum of Short-term borrowings, Current portion of
long-term debt and Long-term debt) at the reporting date to consolidated “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
Amortization” (EBITDA) for the 12-month period ended on the same date. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section
in Item 7 for a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with the covenant.
The Company’s Notes, Debentures and revolving credit agreement contain various default and cross-default provisions. In the
event of default under any one of these arrangements, acceleration of the maturity of anyrd
30
Table of Contents
one or more of these borrowings may result. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional
information.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan
Participants in the Company’s employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) are allowed to contribute up to the lesser of 50% of their
annual compensation and the maximum dollar amount allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches 6% of
eligible employee contributions. The Company’s matching contributions to the ESOP charged to operations were $133.7 million in
2021 compared to $120.0 million in 2020. At December 31, 2021, there were 20,639,085 shares of the Company’s common stock
being held by the ESOP, representing 7.9% of the total number of voting shares outstanding. See Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information concerning the Company’s ESOP.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Management utilizes certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US
GAAP) to analyze and manage the performance of the business. The required disclosures for these non-GAAP measures are shown
below. The Company provides such non-GAAP information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to
evaluate the Company’s operations. Management does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP measures
in isolation from, or in substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income
before income taxes and interest, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes
the loss on the Wattyl divestiture. Management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA useful in understanding the operating
performance of the Company. The reader is cautioned that the Company’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be compared
to other entities unknowingly. Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income or net
operating cash as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. The reader should refer to the determination of
net income and net operating cash in accordance with US GAAP disclosed in the Statements of Consolidated Income and
Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows in Item 8.
The following table summarizes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by management for the years indicated below:

Loss on Wattyl divestiture 111.9 — 
Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,267.8 $ 3,441.0 
Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Net operating cash, as shown in the Statements of Consolidated Cash
Flows, less the amount reinvested in the business for Capital expenditures and the return of investment to its shareholders by the
payment of cash dividends. Management considers Free Cash Flow to be a useful tool in its determination of appropriate uses of
the Company’s Net operating cash. The reader is cautioned that the Free Cash Flow measure should not be compared to other
entities unknowingly as it may not be comparable and it does not consider certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory
debt and interest payments. The amount shown below should not be considered an alternative to Net operating cash or other cash
flow amounts provided in accordance with US GAAP as disclosed in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows in Item 8.

Adjusted Diluted Net Income Per Share
Management of the Company believes that investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the
disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding the loss on divestiture of Wattyl and Valspar acquisition-related amortization
expense. This adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with US GAAP. It should not be considered a
substitute for earnings per share in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
other companies.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. These determinations were made based upon management’s best estimates, judgments and assumptions that were
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great
likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to
the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and
use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
All of the significant accounting policies that were followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Management believes that the following critical accounting
policies and estimates have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Inventories
Inventories were stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined principally on the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method based on inventory quantities and costs determined during the fourth quarter. Inventory quantities were adjusted throughout
the year as formal cycle counts were completed, or during the fourth quarter as a result of annual physical inventory counts. If
inventories accounted for on the LIFO method are reduced on a year-over-year basis, then liquidation of certain quantities carried at
costs prevailing in prior years occurs. Management recorded the best estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and discontinued
inventories based on historical experience and current trends through reductions to inventory cost by recording a provision included
in Cost of goods sold. If management estimates that the reasonable market value is below cost or determines that future demand
was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected
volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in
inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is provided for in the reserve for obsolescence. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information regarding the impact of the LIFO inventory valuation and the reserve for
obsolescence.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management performs impairment tests of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate
impairment has more likely than not occurred. An optional qualitative assessment allows companies to skip the annual quantitative
test if it is not more likely than not that impairment has occurred based on monitoring key Company financial performance metrics
and macroeconomic conditions. The qualitative assessment is performed when deemed appropriate.
In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management tests goodwill for impairment at the
reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment per the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC or one level below the
operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed
by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic
characteristics. At the time of goodwill impairment testing (if performing a quantitative assessment), management determines fair
value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved
for each reporting unit. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value, then impairment of the reporting unit
exists. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment
testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates,
growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(“WACC”) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as Company-specific risk factors for
each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is
indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational management, considering
industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for
each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual
cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. As an indicator
that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate
of all reporting units’ fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the Company.
The Company had seven components, some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics, to form three
reporting units (also the operating segments) with goodwill as of October 1, 2021, the date of the annual impairment test. The
annual impairment review performed as of October 1, 2021 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or
deemed at risk for impairment.
35
Table of Contents
In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition. Management utilizes the royalty savings
method and valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset or trademark. In this
method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in
estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections, terminal
value rates and, to a lesser extent, tax rates. Discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the WACC methodology
considering any differences in Company-specific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks. Royalty rates are established
by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. Operational management, considering
industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant
trademark. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales
estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. The royalty savings
valuation methodology and calculations used in 2021 impairment testing are consistent with prior years. The annual impairment
review performed as of October 1, 2021 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for
impairment.
The discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based
upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions.
Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value
considering the current economic conditions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of
goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of
the ASC.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the
carrying value of long-lived assets, including Operating lease right-of-use assets, may not be recoverable or the useful life had
changed, impairment tests were performed or the useful life was adjusted. Undiscounted cash flows were used to calculate the
recoverable value of long-lived assets to determine if such assets were not recoverable. If the carrying value of the assets was
deemed to not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the
estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the Fair Value Topic of the ASC. If the usefulness of an asset
was determined to be impaired, then management estimated a new useful life based on the period of time for projected uses of the
asset. Fair value approaches and changes in useful life required management to make certain assumptions based upon information
available at the time the valuation or determination was performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions.
Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or
useful life considering the current economic conditions. All tested long-lived assets or groups of long-lived assets had undiscounted
cash flows that were substantially in excess of their carrying value. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of long-lived assets in accordance with the Property, Plant and
Equipment Topic of the ASC. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for the Property, Plant and Equipment
accounting policy.
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
To determine the Company’s ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans,
management must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee
works. To determine the obligations of such benefit plans, management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key
assumptions such as discount rates, inflation, long-term investment returns, mortality, employee turnover, rate of compensation
increases and medical and prescription drug costs. Management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that
the most current information available is being considered. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside
management’s control could have a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.
In accordance with the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company recognizes each plan’s funded status as an asset for
overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are
recognized and recorded in AOCI. The amounts recorded in AOCI will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and
service costs change, and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net
periodic benefit costs.
In 2022, pension costs are expected to decrease slightly and other postretirement benefit plan costs are expected to increase slightly
based on the actuarial assumptions being applied. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information
concerning the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.

Environmental Matters
The Company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned
sites (including sites which were previously owned and/or operated by businesses acquired by the Company). The Company
initially provides for estimated costs of environmental-related activities relating to its past operations and third-party sites for which
commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards
and professional judgment. These estimated costs, which are mostly undiscounted, are determined based on currently available
facts regarding each site. If the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that
range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range, the minimum of the range is provided.
The Company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediation-related activities and adjusts its
environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and
as additional accounting guidelines are issued. Actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent
uncertainties involved. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning the accrual for
extended environmental-related activities and a discussion concerning unaccrued future loss contingencies.
Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities
In the course of its business, the Company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation
relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust
claims. Management believes that the Company has properly accrued for all known liabilities that existed and those where a loss
was deemed probable for which a fair value was available or an amount could be reasonably estimated in accordance with US
GAAP. However, because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future
litigation is unpredictable, the Company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued.
In the event that the Company’s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the
recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability
is accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties involved, any potential liability determined to be attributable to the Company
arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial
condition. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning litigation.
Income Taxes
The Company estimated income taxes for each jurisdiction that it operated in. This involved estimating taxable earnings, specific
taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible
exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes will
be made in the period in which the changes occur.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. These assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the
interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in
time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further
interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in our Statements of Consolidated Income in the period
in which these events occur. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning income
taxes.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize
derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative
or trading purposes. In 2021 and 2020, the Company utilized U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contracts to hedge the
Company’s net investment in its European operations. The contracts have been designated as net investment hedges and have
various maturity dates. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company entered into forward foreign
currency exchange contracts during 2021 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no material contracts
outstanding at December 31, 2021. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are described in Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations. However, we
do not expect currency translation, transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Report of Management
On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Shareholders of The Sherwin-Williams Company
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We recognize that internal control over financial reporting
cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and is subject to the possibility of human error or the
circumvention or the overriding of internal control. Therefore, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, we believe we have designed into the process
safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.
In order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021, we
conducted an assessment of its effectiveness under the supervision and with the participation of our management group, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. This assessment was based on the criteria established in the 2013
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and
their report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included on page 41 of this report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Sherwin-Williams Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited The Sherwin-Williams Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Sherwin-Williams Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of The Sherwin-Williams Company as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the
related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a) and our
report dated February 17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Sherwin-Williams Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Sherwin-Williams Company (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and

Gibbsboro environmental-related accrual
Description of the Matter As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had
short-term and long-term accruals for environmental-related activities of $45.9
million and $277.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. The Company’s
largest and most complex site is the Gibbsboro, New Jersey site (“Gibbsboro”) and
the substantial majority of the environmental-related accrual relates to this site.
Gibbsboro consists of six operable units which contain a combination of soil,
waterbodies and groundwater contamination, and are in various phases of
investigation and remediation with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).
The Company’s estimated environmental-related accrual for Gibbsboro is based on
industry standards and professional judgement, and the most significant
assumptions underlying the estimated cost of remediation efforts reserved for
Gibbsboro are the types and extent of contamination.
Auditing the Company’s environmental-related accrual at the Gibbsboro site
required complex judgement due to the inherent challenges in identifying the type
and extent of future remedies and the costs of implementing those remedies in
determining the probable and reasonably estimable loss for which the Company
will be responsible.
How We Addressed the Matter
in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of controls over the Company's processes to estimate the Gibbsboro
environmental-related accrual. For example, we tested controls over management’s
review of the environmental loss calculations and the key assumptions affecting
those calculations as described above.
To test the Gibbsboro environmental-related accrual, our audit procedures
included, among others, a review of correspondence with the EPA supporting the
Company’s assessment of the type and extent of contamination at the Gibbsboro
site for which the Company is responsible. We involved our environmental
specialists to confirm our understanding of the remediation plans for the most
significant operable units within the Gibbsboro site and to evaluate the Company's
methodology and assumptions to estimate the unit cost and extent of contamination
in accordance with industry practice, applicable laws and regulations. We
recalculated the remediation cost estimate based on unit cost and estimated extent
of remediation required. We reconciled types and extent of contamination
identified in communications between the Company and the EPA to the Company’s
remediation cost estimates recorded for Gibbsboro and confirmed a sample of
underlying cost estimates with third-parties. We also conducted a search for
publicly available information that might indicate facts contrary to the types and
extent of contamination currently identified in the Company’s remediation cost
estimates recorded for Gibbsboro.
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1908.

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(millions of dollars, unless otherwise noted)
NOTE 1 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Sherwin-Williams Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
(collectively, the Company). Inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)
requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those amounts.
Nature of Operations
The Company is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to
professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America, with additional operations in the
Caribbean region, Europe, Asia and Australia.
Reportable Segments
See Note 21 for further details.
Cash Equivalents
Management considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable were recorded at the time of credit sales net of allowance for credit losses. The Company recorded an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $48.9 million, $53.5 million and $36.5 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively, to reduce Accounts receivable to the net amount expected to be collected (estimated net realizable value).
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments” (ASC 326) using the modified retrospective transition method, electing to not restate prior periods. This
ASU replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. As a result of the
transition method elected, the required comparative period disclosures are prepared in accordance with the incurred loss
impairment methodology.
Under ASC 326, the Company reviews the collectibility of the Accounts receivable balance each reporting period and estimates the
allowance based on historical bad debt experience, aging of accounts receivable, current creditworthiness of customers, current
economic factors, as well as reasonable and supportable forward-looking information. Accounts receivable balances are written-off
against the allowance if a final determination of uncollectibility is made. All provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts are
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 17 for further details.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment (including leasehold improvements) is stated on the basis of cost. Depreciation is charged to expense
using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives which range from 5 to 25 years for buildings and 3 to 15 years
for machinery and equipment. Depreciation and amortization are included in the appropriate Cost of goods sold or Selling, general
and administrative expenses caption on the Statements of Consolidated Income.
51
Table of Contents
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase
method. Intangible assets include trademarks, customer relationships and intellectual property. In accordance with the Goodwill and
Other Intangibles Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), goodwill
and indefinite-lived trademarks are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as whenever an
event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has more likely than not occurred. Finite-lived intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which ranges primarily from 15 to 20 years. See Note 5 for
further details.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, management evaluates the recoverability and remaining
lives of long-lived assets (including right-of-use assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. See Note 5 for further details.
Derivative Instruments
The Company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate certain risk exposures as part of its overall financial risk management
policy and accounts for these instruments in accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. Derivatives are
recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value of the derivative instruments
are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivative instrument qualifies for and is designated in an effective hedging
relationship.
The Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of less than twelve months in 2021, 2020, and
2019, primarily to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no material foreign currency option and forward
contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. See Note 18 for further details.
The Company also entered into cross currency swap contracts to hedge its net investment in European operations in 2021, 2020,
and 2019. These contracts qualified for and were designated as net investment hedges as permitted under US GAAP. The changes
in fair value for the cross currency swaps are recognized in the foreign currency translation adjustments component of AOCI. The
cash flow impact of these instruments is classified as an investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 15
for further details.
Non-Traded Investments
The Company has investments in the U.S. affordable housing and historic renovation real estate markets and certain other
investments that have been identified as variable interest entities. However, because the Company does not have the power to direct
the day-to-day operations of the investments and the risk of loss is limited to the amount of contributed capital, the Company is not
considered the primary beneficiary. In accordance with the Consolidation Topic of the ASC, the investments are not consolidated.
For affordable housing investments entered into prior to the January 1, 2015 adoption of ASU 2014-01, the Company uses the
effective yield method to determine the carrying value of the investments. Under the effective yield method, the initial cost of the
investments is amortized to income tax expense over the period that the tax credits are recognized. For affordable housing
investments entered into on or after the January 1, 2015 adoption of ASU 2014-01, the Company uses the proportional amortization
method. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investments is amortized to income tax expense in
proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received. The carrying value of the investments are recorded in Other assets. The
liabilities for the estimated future capital contributions are recorded in Other accruals and Other long-term liabilities. The following
table summarizes the balances related to the investments at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
2021 2020 2019
Other assets $ 355.8 $ 198.2 $ 176.2 
Other accruals 61.8 89.0 87.3 
Other long-term liabilities 289.7 127.3 87.1 
Standby Letters of Credit
The Company occasionally enters into standby letter of credit agreements to guarantee various operating activities. These
agreements provide credit availability to the various beneficiaries if certain contractual events occur. Amounts outstanding under
these agreements totaled $89.2 million, $51.3 million and $61.2 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
52
Table of Contents
Product Warranties
The Company offers assurance type product warranties for certain products. The specific terms and conditions of such warranties
vary depending on the product or customer contract requirements. Management estimated the costs of unsettled product warranty
claims based on historical results and experience and included an amount in Other accruals. Management periodically assesses the
adequacy of the accrual for product warranty claims and adjusts the accrual as necessary. Changes in the Company’s accrual for
product warranty claims during 2021, 2020 and 2019, including customer satisfaction settlements during the year, were as follows:
2021 2020 2019
Balance at January 1 $ 43.3 $ 42.3 $ 57.1 
Charges to expense 27.5 38.1 32.5 
Settlements (35.6) (37.1) (47.3)
Balance at December 31 $ 35.2 $ 43.3 $ 42.3 
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the Retirement
Benefits Topic of the ASC, which requires the recognition of a plan’s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a
liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. See Note 7 for further details.
Environmental Matters
Capital expenditures for ongoing environmental compliance measures were recorded in Property, plant and equipment, and related
expenses were included in the normal operating expenses of conducting business. The Company accrued for environmental-related
activities for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs could be reasonably estimated based
on industry standards and professional judgment. Accrued amounts were primarily recorded on an undiscounted basis and have not
been recorded net of insurance proceeds in accordance with the Offsetting Subtopic of the Balance Sheet Topic of the ASC.
Environmental-related expenses included direct costs of investigation and remediation and indirect costs such as compensation and
benefits for employees directly involved in the investigation and remediation activities and fees paid to outside engineering,
consulting and law firms. See Notes 9 and 18 for further details.
ESOP
The Company accounts for its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), in accordance with the Employee Stock Ownership Plans
Subtopic of the Compensation – Stock Ownership Topic of the ASC. The Company recognized compensation expense for amounts
contributed to the ESOP. See Note 12 for further details.
Stock-Based Compensation
The cost of the Company’s stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with the Stock Compensation Topic of the ASC.
See Note 13 for further details.
Other Liabilities
The Company retains risk for certain liabilities, primarily workers’ compensation claims, employee medical and disability benefits,
and automobile, property, general and product liability claims. Estimated amounts were accrued for certain workers’ compensation,
employee medical and disability benefits, automobile and property claims filed but unsettled, and estimated claims incurred but not
reported. Estimates were based upon management’s estimated aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience,
actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and actuarially-developed models for estimating certain liabilities. Certain
estimated general and product liability claims filed but unsettled were accrued based on management’s best estimate of ultimate
settlement or actuarial calculations of potential liability using industry experience and actuarial assumptions developed for similar
types of claims.
Foreign Currency Translation
All consolidated non-highly inflationary foreign operations use the local currency of the country of operation as the functional
currency and translated the local currency asset and liability accounts at year-end exchange rates while income and expense
accounts were translated at average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments were included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of Shareholders’ equity.
53
Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognized revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the agreement were satisfied. This generally
occurs with the transfer of control of our products to the customer. Collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue was probable at
the time of recognition. See Note 17 for further details.
Customer and Vendor Consideration
The Company offered certain customers rebate and sales incentive programs which were classified as reductions in net sales. Such
programs were in the form of volume rebates, rebates that constituted a percentage of sales or rebates for attaining certain sales
goals. The Company received consideration from certain suppliers of raw materials in the form of volume rebates or rebates that
constituted a percentage of purchases. These rebates were recognized on an accrual basis by the Company as a reduction of the
purchase price of the raw materials and a subsequent reduction of Cost of goods sold when the related product was sold.
Costs of Goods Sold
Included in Costs of goods sold were costs for materials, manufacturing, distribution and related support. Distribution costs
included expenses related to the distribution of products including inbound freight charges, purchase and receiving costs,
warehousing costs, internal transfer costs and other costs incurred to ship products. Also included in Costs of goods sold were total
technical expenditures, which included research and development costs, quality control, product formulation expenditures and other
similar items. Research and development costs included in technical expenditures were $115.9 million, $97.1 million and $103.1
million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling costs included advertising expenses, marketing costs, employee and store costs and sales commissions. The cost of
advertising was expensed as incurred. The Company incurred $311.9 million, $363.4 million and $355.2 million in advertising
costs during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. General and administrative expenses included human resources, legal, finance and
other support and administrative functions.
Earnings Per Share
Common stock held in a revocable trust (see Note 11) was not included in outstanding shares for basic or diluted income per share
calculations. Basic and diluted net income per share were calculated using the treasury stock method in accordance with the
Earnings Per Share Topic of the ASC. Basic net income per share amounts were computed based on the weighted-average number
of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share amounts were computed based on the weighted-average number
of shares outstanding plus all dilutive securities potentially outstanding during the year. See Note 20 for further details.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements for 2019 and 2020 have
been reclassified to conform to the 2021 presentation.

NOTE 2 – RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Adopted in 2021
Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain
exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740. It also improves consistent application of and simplifies U.S. GAAP for other
areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments are being applied prospectively. The adoption of
ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Not Yet Adopted
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and
Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU requires an acquiring entity to recognize and measure contract assets and
contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of
adopting this ASU.
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about
Government Assistance.” This ASU requires disclosures for material government assistance transactions during annual reporting
periods. The disclosures include information about the nature of the transaction, the related accounting policies used to account for
the government assistance, the effect of government assistance on the entity’s financial statements, and any significant terms and
conditions. The ASU is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2022 and will not affect the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows as the standard only impacts annual financial statement footnote disclosures.
NOTE 3 – ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
During the third quarter of 2021, the Company signed an agreement to acquire the European industrial coatings business of Sika
AG (Sika). Sika’s European industrial coatings business engineers, manufactures and sells corrosion protection coating systems and
fire protection coating systems. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first
quarter of 2022. The acquired business will be reported within the Company’s Performance Coatings Group.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Specialty Polymers, Inc. (Specialty Polymers), a
leading manufacturer and developer of water-based polymers used in architectural and industrial coatings and other applications.
The acquisition added to the Company’s existing internal resin manufacturing capabilities. Specialty Polymers will be reported
within the Company’s Performance Coatings Group.
During the first quarter of 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of a domestic coatings company. The acquisition expanded
the Performance Coatings Group’s platform for growth and portfolio of brands and technologies.
The aggregate purchase price for acquisitions closed in 2021 was approximately $227.0 million, including amounts withheld as
security for certain representations, warranties and obligations of the sellers. The purchase price for each acquisition was
preliminarily allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities based on information available at the date of acquisition and may change
as the Company completes its analysis of net assets acquired, primarily the valuation of intangible assets. As of December 31, 2021,
$155.6 million of goodwill and $11.3 million of intangible assets were recognized from these transactions. The preliminary
purchase price allocation for each acquisition is expected to be finalized within the allowable measurement period. The results of
operations for the acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective acquisition dates.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented as the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results is not
material.
On March 31, 2021, the Company divested Wattyl, an Australian and New Zealand manufacturer and seller of architectural and
protective paint and coatings with annual revenue of approximately $200 million. The divestiture will enable the Company to focus
its resources on global opportunities which better align with our long-term strategies. In connection with this transaction, the
Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $111.9 million within Other general (income) expense - net (see Note 15). The Wattyl
divestiture does not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements as the
Company’s decision to divest this business did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s
operations and financial results.
55
Table of Contents
During 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of a domestic packaging company and two European coatings companies for
an aggregate purchase price of $84.4 million, including amounts withheld as security for certain representations, warranties and
obligations of the sellers. These acquisitions support the growth of the Performance Coatings Group by providing new technologies
and an expanded global platform. The acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations. The results of operations of
these companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of
operations have not been presented as the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results was not material.

Finished goods $ 1,378.8 $ 1,427.6 $ 1,509.6 
Work in process and raw materials 548.4 376.5 380.0 
Inventories $ 1,927.2 $ 1,804.1 $ 1,889.6 
Inventories were stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost primarily determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method. Management believes that the use of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues.
The following table summarizes the extent to which the Company’s Inventories use the LIFO cost method, and presents the effect
on Inventories had the Company used the first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory valuation method.
2021 2020 2019
Percentage of total inventories on LIFO 70 % 72 % 72 %
Excess of FIFO over LIFO $ 593.0 $ 312.1 $ 339.8
During 2021, certain inventories accounted for on the LIFO method were reduced, resulting in the liquidation of certain quantities
carried at costs prevailing in prior years. The 2021 liquidation increased net income by $25.8 million.
The Company recorded a reserve for obsolescence of $118.6 million, $125.8 million and $115.4 million at December 31, 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively, to reduce Inventories to their estimated net realizable value.

NOTE 5 – LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Included in Property, plant and equipment, net were the following:

Property, plant and equipment, net $ 1,867.3 $ 1,834.5 $ 1,835.2 
In accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable or the useful life may have changed, impairment tests are to be
performed. Undiscounted cash flows are used to calculate the recoverable value of long-lived assets to determine if such assets are
not recoverable. If the carrying value of the assets is deemed to not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is the amount
by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the Fair
Value Topic of the ASC. No material impairments of long-lived assets were recorded in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
During 2021, the Company acquired two companies which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $155.6 million and finite-
lived intangibles of $11.3 million. During 2019, the Company acquired three companies which resulted in the recognition of
goodwill of $14.2 million and finite-lived intangibles of $34.9 million. In addition, during 2021, the Company divested its Wattyl
business in Australia and New Zealand. See Note 3 for additional information related to the acquisitions and divestiture.
In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested
for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and interim impairment tests are performed whenever an event occurs or
circumstances change that indicate an impairment has more likely than not occurred. October 1 has been established for the annual
impairment review. At the time of impairment testing, values are estimated separately for goodwill and trademarks with indefinite
lives using a valuation model, incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each group of assets. An
optional qualitative assessment may alleviate the need to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test when impairment is
unlikely.
The annual impairment review performed as of October 1, 2021 did not result in any trademark or goodwill impairment. The
annual impairment review performed as of October 1, 2020 resulted in trademark impairment of $2.3 million in the Performance
Coatings Group related to lower than anticipated sales of an acquired brand and no goodwill impairment.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a strategic review of its business lines as part of the annual planning
cycle. Decisions were made during this review related to certain brands which resulted in a reduction to the long-term forecasted
net sales for certain indefinite-lived trademarks acquired in the Valspar acquisition within the Performance Coatings and Consumer
Brands Groups. As a result of the strategic decisions made at that time and in conjunction with the annual impairment review
performed as of October 1, 2019, the Company recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges totaling $122.1 million related to
certain recently acquired indefinite-lived trademarks. These charges included impairments totaling $117.0 million in the
Performance Coatings Group and $5.1 million in the Consumer Brands Group. In the Performance Coatings Group, $75.6 million
related to trademarks in North America directly associated with strategic decisions made to rebrand industrial products to the
Sherwin-Williams® brand name, $25.7 million related to trademarks in the Asia Pacific region as a direct result of recent
performance that reduced the long-term forecasted net sales and $15.7 million related to other recently acquired trademarks in
various regions.The annual impairment review did not result in any goodwill impairment.

Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is estimated as follows for the next five years: $299.1 million in 2022, $297.3 million
in 2023, $294.0 million in 2024, $286.7 million in 2025 and $282.3 million in 2026.
Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value related to reporting units and indefinite-lived trademarks are reasonable,
actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.
Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact and
future impairment charges may be required.(1)

Among other restrictions, the Company’s notes, debentures and revolving credit agreement contain certain covenants relating to
liens, ratings changes, merger and sale of assets, consolidated leverage and change of control, as defined in the agreements. In the
event of default under any one of these arrangements, acceleration of the maturity of any one or more of these borrowings may
result. The Company was in compliance with all covenants for all years presented.
In November 2021, the Company issued $500.0 million of 2.20% Senior Notes due March 2032 and $500.0 million of 2.90%
Senior Notes due March 2052 in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay
outstanding borrowings under the Company’s domestic commercial paper program.

Short-Term Borrowings
On June 29, 2021, the Company and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sherwin-Williams Canada Inc. (SW Canada) and
Sherwin-Williams Luxembourg S.à r.l. (SW Luxembourg, together with the Company and SW Canada, the Borrowers), entered into
a new five-year $2.000 billion credit agreement (New Credit Agreement). The New Credit Agreement may be used for general
corporate purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements. The New Credit agreement replaced the $2.000 billion
credit agreement dated July 19, 2018, as amended, which was terminated effective June 29, 2021. The New Credit Agreement will
mature on June 29, 2026 and provides that the Company may request to extend the maturity date of the facility for two additional
one-year periods. In addition, the New Credit Agreement provides that the Borrowers may increase the aggregate amount of the
facility to $2.750 billion, subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in the increase, and the Borrowers may request
letters of credit in an amount of up to $250.0 million. At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no short-term borrowings
under these credit agreements.
On August 2, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated $625.0 million credit agreement (August 2021 Credit
Agreement), which amends and restates the five-year credit agreement entered into in September 2017. The August 2021 Credit
Agreement was subsequently amended on multiple dates to extend the maturity of commitments available for borrowing or letters
of credit under the agreement. On May 9, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (May 2016 Credit
Agreement), subsequently amended on multiple dates to extend the maturity of commitments available for borrowing or letters of
credit under the agreement. The May 2016 credit agreement gives the Company the right to borrow and obtain letters of credit up to
an aggregate availability of $875.0 million. These credit agreements are being used for general corporate purposes. At
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements.
The Company’s available capacity under its committed credit agreements is reduced for amounts outstanding under its domestic
commercial paper program and letters of credit. At December 31, 2021, the Company had unused capacity under its various credit
agreements of $2.725 billion. The table below summarizes the Company’s short-term borrowings:

NOTE 7 – PENSION, HEALTH CARE AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company provides pension benefits to substantially all full-time employees through primarily noncontributory defined
contribution or defined benefit plans and certain health care and life insurance benefits to domestic active employees and eligible
retirees. In accordance with the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company recognizes an asset for overfunded defined
benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans and a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. In addition, actuarial gains
and losses and prior service costs of such plans are recorded in AOCI. The amounts recorded in AOCI will continue to be modified
as actuarial assumptions and service costs change, and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through
the net pension cost (credit) and net periodic benefit cost (credit).
Health Care Plans
The Company provides certain domestic health care plans that are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as
deductibles and coinsurance. There were 29,016, 27,782 and 27,030 active employees entitled to receive benefits under these plans
at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cost of these benefits for active employees, which includes claims incurred
but not reported, amounted to $336.0 million, $298.8 million and $301.6 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Defined Contribution Pension Plans
The Company’s annual contribution for its domestic defined contribution pension plan was $85.3 million, $77.0 million and $72.7
million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The contribution percentage ranges from two percent to seven percent of
compensation for covered employees based on an age and service formula. Assets in employee accounts of the domestic defined
contribution pension plan are invested in various investment funds as directed by the participants. These investment funds did not
own a significant number of shares of the Company’s common stock for any year presented.
The Company’s annual contributions for its foreign defined contribution pension plans, which are based on various percentages of
compensation for covered employees up to certain limits, were $17.9 million, $22.5 million and $24.5 million for 2021, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Assets in employee accounts of the foreign defined contribution pension plans are invested in various
investment funds. These investment funds did not own a significant number of shares of the Company’s common stock for any year
presented.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
In 2018, the Company’s domestic defined benefit pension plan was split into two separate overfunded plans: one that will continue
to operate, and one that was frozen and subsequently terminated during 2018 (Terminated Plan). Active participants in the
Terminated Plan were moved to the Company’s domestic defined contribution plan (Qualified Replacement Plan). The Company
settled the liabilities of the Terminated Plan through a combination of (i) lump sum payments to eligible participants who elected to
receive them and (ii) the purchase of annuity contracts for participants who either did not elect lump sums or were already
receiving benefit payments. The lump sum payments were paid in December 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company
purchased annuity contracts to settle the remaining liabilities of the Terminated Plan. The annuity contract purchase resulted in a
settlement charge of $32.4 million in the first quarter of 2019. The remaining surplus of the Terminated Plan is being used, as
prescribed in the applicable regulations, to fund Company contributions to the Qualified Replacement Plan. During 2019, the
Company transferred the remaining surplus of $242.2 million to a suspense account held within a trust for the Qualified
Replacement Plan. This amount included $131.8 million of Company common stock (900,000 shares). The shares are treated as
treasury stock in accordance with ASC 715. See Note 11. The remaining surplus consists of investment funds held at fair value. See
Note 16.
At December 31, 2021, the domestic defined benefit pension plan was overfunded, with a projected benefit obligation of $120.8
million, fair value of plan assets of $155.2 million and excess plan assets of $34.4 million. The plan was funded in accordance with
all applicable regulations at December 31, 2021.
The Company has thirty-three foreign defined benefit pension plans. At December 31, 2021, twenty-seven of the Company’s
foreign defined benefit pension plans were unfunded or underfunded, with combined accumulated benefit obligations, projected
benefit obligations, fair values of net assets and deficiencies of plan assets of $95.2 million, $108.5 million, $29.5 million and
$79.0 million, respectively.
The Company expects to make the following benefit payments for all domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans: $15.2
million in 2022; $14.8 million in 2023; $16.1 million in 2024; $16.9 million in 2025; $23.1 million in 2026; and $105.4 million in
2027 through 2031. The Company expects to contribute $5.8 million to the foreign plans in 2022.
The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service credits for the defined benefit pension plans that are expected to be amortized
from AOCI into the net pension costs in 2022 are $0.3 million and $(0.2) million, respectively.

Service cost is recorded in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expense. All other components of Net
pension costs are recorded in Other (income) expense - net.
The Company employs a total return investment approach for the domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plan assets. A mix
of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of assets for a prudent level of risk. In
determining the expected long-term rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets, management considers the historical rates
of return, the nature of investments and an expectation of future investment strategies. The target allocations for plan assets are
35% – 65% equity securities, 35% – 55% fixed income securities and 0% – 10% other (including alternative investments and cash).

Other Postretirement Benefits
Employees of the Company hired in the United States prior to January 1, 1993 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit,
and certain groups of employees added through acquisitions, are eligible for health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement,
subject to the terms of the unfunded plans. There were 3,410, 3,465 and 3,481 retired employees entitled to receive such
postretirement benefits at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

NOTE 8 – LEASES
The Company leases retail stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities, office space and equipment under operating lease
agreements. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease
payments over the lease term. The majority of the ROU asset and lease liability balances relate to the retail operations of The
Americas Group.
Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s discretion and is not
reasonably certain at lease commencement. The Company does not account for lease and non-lease components of contracts
separately for any underlying asset class. Some leases have variable payments, however, because they are not based on an index or
rate, they are not included in the ROU assets and liabilities. Variable payments for real estate leases relate primarily to common
area maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities associated with the properties. Variable payments for equipment leases relate
primarily to hours, miles, or other quantifiable usage factors which are not determinable at the time the lease agreement is entered
into by the Company. The Company has made an accounting policy election by underlying asset class to not apply the recognition
requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases. As a result, certain leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the
balance sheet and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Most leases do not contain an implicit discount
rate. Therefore, the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the time of lease inception
is used to discount lease payments to present value.
Additional lease information is summarized below:
2021 2020 2019
Operating lease cost $ 478.0 $ 464.5 $ 452.9 
Short-term lease cost 43.8 41.1 39.7

NOTE 9 – OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES
The operations of the Company, like those of other companies in its industry, are subject to various domestic and foreign
environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products, but also impose
potential liability on the Company for past operations. Management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose
increasingly stringent requirements upon the Company and the industry in the future. Management believes that the Company
conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs
designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance.
The Company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned
sites (including sites which were previously owned and/or operated by businesses acquired by the Company). In addition, the
Company, together with other parties, has been designated a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental
protection laws for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination and hazardous waste at a number of third-
party sites, primarily Superfund sites. In general, these laws provide that potentially responsible parties may be held jointly and
severally liable for investigation and remediation costs regardless of fault. The Company may be similarly designated with respect
to additional third-party sites in the future.
The Company initially provides for estimated costs of environmental-related activities relating to its past operations and third-party
sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on
industry standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs, which are mostly undiscounted, are determined based on
currently available facts regarding each site. If the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific
amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range, the minimum of the range is
provided.
The Company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediation-related activities and adjusts its
environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and
as additional accounting guidelines are issued. At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had accruals reported on the
balance sheet as Other long-term liabilities of $277.4 million, $300.5 million and $314.8 million, respectively. Estimated costs of
current investigation and remediation activities of $45.9 million, $68.6 million and $57.6 million are included in Other accruals at
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved including, among others, the
number and financial condition of parties involved with respect to any given site, the volumetric contribution which may be
attributed to the Company relative to that attributed to other parties, the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved, the various
technologies that can be used for remediation and the determination of acceptable remediation with respect to a particular site. If
the Company’s future loss contingency is ultimately determined to be at the unaccrued maximum of the estimated range of possible
outcomes for every site for which costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company’s accrual for environmental-related activities
would be $101.4 million higher than the minimum accruals at December 31, 2021. Additionally, costs for environmental-related
activities may not be reasonably estimable at early stages of investigation and therefore would not be included in the unaccrued
maximum amount.
Four of the Company’s currently and formerly owned manufacturing sites (“Major Sites”) account for the majority of the accrual
for environmental-related activities and the unaccrued maximum of the estimated range of possible outcomes at December 31,
2021. At December 31, 2021, $278.5 million, or 86.1% of the total accrual, related directly to the Major Sites. In the aggregate
unaccrued maximum of $101.4 million at December 31, 2021, $78.7 million, or 77.6%, related to the Major Sites. The significant
cost components of this liability continue to be related to remedy implementation, regulatory agency interaction, project
management and other costs. While different for each specific environmental situation, these components generally each account
for approximately 85%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, of the accrued amount and those percentages are subject to change over time.
While environmental investigations and remedial actions are in different stages at these sites, additional investigations, remedial
actions and monitoring will likely be required at each site.
The largest and most complex of the Major Sites is the Gibbsboro, New Jersey site (“Gibbsboro”) which comprises the substantial
majority of the environmental-related accrual. Gibbsboro, a former manufacturing plant, and related areas, which ceased operations
in 1978, has had various areas included on the National Priorities List since 1999. This location has soil, waterbodies, and
groundwater contamination related to the historic operations of the facility. Gibbsboro has been divided by the Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) into six operable units (“OUs”) based on location and characteristics, whose investigation and
remediation efforts are likely to occur over an extended period of time. Each of the OUs are in various phases of investigation and
remediation with the EPA that provide enough information to reasonably estimate cost ranges and record environmental-related
accruals. The most significant assumptions underlying the reliability and precision of remediation cost
68
Table of Contents
estimates for the Gibbsboro site are the type and extent of future remedies to be selected by the EPA and the costs of implementing
those remedies.
The remaining three Major Sites comprising the majority of the accrual include (1) a multi-party Superfund site that has received a
record of decision from the federal EPA and is currently in the remedial design phase for one operable unit and for which a
remedial investigation/feasibility study has been submitted for another operable unit, (2) a closed paint manufacturing facility that
is in the operation and maintenance phase of remediation under both federal and state EPA programs, and (3) a formerly-owned site
containing warehouse and office space that is in the remedial investigation phase under a state EPA program. Each of these three
Major Sites are in phases of investigation and remediation that provide sufficient information to reasonably estimate cost ranges
and record environmental-related accruals.
Excluding the Major Sites discussed above, no sites are individually material to the total accrual balance. There are multiple, future
events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution, and securing applicable
governmental agency approvals, all of which have the potential to contribute to the uncertainty surrounding these future events. As
these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation change, the existing reserve will be
adjusted.
Management cannot presently estimate the ultimate potential loss contingencies related to these sites or other less significant sites
until such time as a substantial portion of the investigation at the sites is completed and remedial action plans are developed.
Unasserted claims could have a material effect on the Company’s loss contingency as more information becomes available over
time. At December 31, 2021, the Company did not have material loss contingency accruals related to unasserted claims.
Management does not expect that a material portion of unrecognized loss contingencies will be recoverable through insurance,
indemnification agreements or other sources. In the event any future loss contingency significantly exceeds the current amount
accrued, the recording of the ultimate liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during
which the additional costs are accrued. Moreover, management does not believe that any potential liability ultimately attributed to
the Company for its environmental-related matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
liquidity, or cash flow due to the extended length of time during which environmental investigation and remediation takes place. An
estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s operations cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties.
Management expects these contingent environmental-related liabilities to be resolved over an extended period of time.
Management is unable to provide a more specific time frame due to the indeterminate amount of time to conduct investigation
activities at any site, the indeterminate amount of time to obtain environmental agency approval, as necessary, with respect to
investigation and remediation activities, and the indeterminate amount of time necessary to conduct remediation activities.
The Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic of the ASC requires a liability to be recognized for the fair value of a
conditional asset retirement obligation if a settlement date and fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company recognizes a
liability for any conditional asset retirement obligation when sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate a settlement
date to determine the fair value of such a liability. The Company has identified certain conditional asset retirement obligations at
various current and closed manufacturing, distribution and store facilities. These obligations relate primarily to asbestos abatement,
hazardous waste Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) closures, well abandonment, transformers and used oil
disposals and underground storage tank closures. Using investigative, remediation and disposal methods that are currently available
to the Company, the estimated costs of these obligations were accrued and are not significant. The recording of additional liabilities
for future conditional asset retirement obligations may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period
during which the costs are accrued. Management does not believe that any potential liability ultimately attributed to the Company
for its conditional asset retirement obligations will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, or
cash flow due to the extended period of time over which sufficient information may become available regarding the closure or
modification of any one or group of the Company’s facilities. An estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s operations
cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties.

NOTE 10 – LITIGATION
In the course of its business, the Company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation
relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust
claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to the Company. These uncertainties will
ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction
of a liability. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic of the ASC, the Company accrues for these contingencies by a charge to
income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. In the event that the Company’s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher
than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on the Company’s results of
operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In
those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss
cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to the Company may result in a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during
which such liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount
accrued, the Contingencies Topic of the ASC requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a
loss or additional loss may have been incurred.
Lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation. The Company’s past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead
pigments and lead-based paints. The Company, along with other companies, is and has been a defendant in a number of legal
proceedings, including individual personal injury actions, purported class actions, and actions brought by various counties, cities,
school districts and other government-related entities, arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based
paints. The plaintiffs’ claims have been based upon various legal theories, including negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty,
negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy,
violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws, enterprise liability, market share liability, public nuisance, unjust
enrichment and other theories. The plaintiffs seek various damages and relief, including personal injury and property damage, costs
relating to the detection and abatement of lead-based paint from buildings, costs associated with a public education campaign,
medical monitoring costs and others. The Company has also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture
and sale of non-lead-based paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories, including the failure to adequately warn of
potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint on surfaces previously painted with lead-
based paint. The Company believes that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and is
vigorously defending such litigation. The Company expects that additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation may be
filed against the Company in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of
damages and relief. The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional lead pigment and lead-based paint
litigation that may be filed, including utilizing all avenues of appeal, if necessary.
Notwithstanding the Company’s views on the merits, litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties, and the Company
ultimately may not prevail. Adverse court rulings or determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect the lead pigment
and lead-based paint litigation against the Company and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and
proceedings. In addition, from time to time, various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted, promulgated or
proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting asserted
health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which the Company and other
manufacturers have been successful.
Due to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation,
the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation and/or administrative regulations
may have on the litigation or against the Company. In addition, management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of
the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation, or resulting from any such legislation and regulations. Except with
respect to the litigation in California discussed below, the Company has not accrued any amounts for such litigation because the
Company does not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the Company believes it is not possible to estimate the range
of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based. In addition, any potential liability
that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. Due to the uncertainties associated
with the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential
liability determined to be attributable to the Company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. An estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s results of
operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties.

Public Nuisance Claim Litigation. The Company and other companies are or were defendants in legal proceedings seeking
recovery based on public nuisance liability theories, among other theories, brought by the State of Rhode Island; the City of St.
Louis, Missouri; various cities and counties in the State of New Jersey; various cities in the State of Ohio and the State of Ohio; the
City of Chicago, Illinois; the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the County of Santa Clara, California, and other public entities in the
State of California; and Lehigh and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania. Except for the Santa Clara County, California
proceeding and the pending Pennsylvania proceedings, all of these legal proceedings have been concluded in favor of the Company
and other defendants at various stages in the proceedings.
Santa Clara County, California Proceeding. The Santa Clara County, California proceeding was initiated in March 2000 in the
Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. After nearly twenty years of litigation, the Company and two other
defendants (ConAgra Grocery Products Company and NL Industries, Inc.) reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to
resolve the litigation on July 17, 2019. The agreement provides that, in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of the
plaintiffs, the defendants collectively shall pay a total of $305.0 million, with the defendants each paying approximately $101.7
million as follows: (i) an initial payment of $25.0 million within sixty days after the entry of a dismissal order and judgment; (ii)
subsequent annual payments of $12.0 million one year after the initial payment and for a period of four years thereafter; and (iii) a
final payment of approximately $16.7 million on the sixth anniversary of the initial payment. Should NL Industries fail to make any
of its payments required under the agreement, the Company has agreed to backstop and pay on behalf of NL Industries a maximum
amount of $15.0 million. On July 24, 2019, the trial court approved the agreement, discharged the receiver, and granted a judgment
of dismissal with prejudice in favor of the defendants. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accruals for this
agreement reported on the balance sheet of $52.7 million and $64.7 million, respectively, with $12.0 million included in Current
liabilities and the remaining $40.7 million and $52.7 million, respectively, included in Other long-term liabilities.
Pennsylvania Proceedings. Two proceedings in Pennsylvania were initiated in October 2018. The Pennsylvania counties of
Montgomery and Lehigh filed complaints against the Company and several other former lead-based paint and lead pigment
manufacturers in the Courts of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and Lehigh County, Pennsylvania,
respectively. In both actions, the counties request declaratory relief establishing the existence of a public nuisance and the
defendants’ contribution to it, the abatement of an ongoing public nuisance arising from the presence of lead-based paint in housing
throughout the applicable county, an injunction against future illicit conduct, and the costs of litigation and attorneys’ fees. After the
defendants removed the actions to federal court and the actions were remanded to state court, the defendants filed preliminary
objections on December 21, 2020, seeking to dismiss the complaints with prejudice. The briefing associated with the preliminary
objections concluded on February 23, 2021.
In the Lehigh County action, the trial court denied the defendants’ preliminary objections on August 6, 2021. Defendants filed a
motion to amend the order to allow an interlocutory appeal or, in the alternative, for reconsideration. The trial court denied the
defendants’ motion on September 13, 2021. On September 27, 2021, the Company answered the complaint, asserted new matter
and affirmative defenses, alleged counterclaims against Lehigh County, and filed a third-party complaint against certain County
officials, other owners of pre-1980 housing, and lead abatement contractors who have been cited for violating state or local laws.
On October 13, 2021, the defendants filed with the Superior Court, one of Pennsylvania’s intermediate appellate courts, a petition
for permission to appeal the trial court’s order denying the defendants’ preliminary objections. On November 17, 2021, the Superior
Court transferred the appeal to the Commonwealth Court, another one of Pennsylvania’s intermediate appellate courts. Lehigh
County filed its answer to defendants’ petition for permission to appeal on January 7, 2022. All deadlines and discovery in the
Lehigh County action will be held in abeyance pending the appellate court proceedings.
In the Montgomery County action, the trial court denied the defendants’ preliminary objections on October 15, 2021. The
defendants filed a motion to amend the order overruling their preliminary objections to allow an interlocutory appeal, which the
trial court granted on November 9, 2021. On December 3, 2021, the defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal with the
Commonwealth Court. On January 18, 2022, Montgomery County filed its answer to defendants’ petition for permission to appeal.
All deadlines and discovery in the Montgomery County action will be held in abeyance pending the appellate court proceedings.
Litigation seeking damages from alleged personal injury. The Company and other companies are defendants in a number of
legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other relief from alleged personal injuries. These proceedings include claims by
children allegedly injured from ingestion of lead pigment or lead-containing paint and claims for damages allegedly incurred by the
children’s parents or guardians. These proceedings generally seek compensatory and punitive damages, and seek other relief
including medical monitoring costs. These proceedings include purported claims by individuals, groups of individuals and class
actions.
The plaintiff in Thomas v. Lead Industries Association, et al., initiated an action in Wisconsin state court against the Company,
other alleged former lead pigment manufacturers and the Lead Industries Association in September 1999. The claims against
71
Table of Contents
the defendants included strict liability, negligence, negligent misrepresentation and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentation and
omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy and enterprise liability. Implicit within these claims is the theory of “risk
contribution” liability (Wisconsin’s theory is similar to market share liability, except that liability can be joint and several) due to
the plaintiff’s inability to identify the manufacturer of any product that allegedly injured the plaintiff. The case ultimately
proceeded to trial and, on November 5, 2007, the jury returned a defense verdict, finding that the plaintiff had ingested white lead
carbonate, but was not brain damaged or injured as a result. The plaintiff appealed, and on December 16, 2010, the Wisconsin
Court of Appeals affirmed the final judgment in favor of the defendants.
Wisconsin is the only jurisdiction to date to apply a theory of liability with respect to alleged personal injury (i.e., risk
contribution/market share liability) that does not require the plaintiff to identify the manufacturer of the product that allegedly
injured the plaintiff in the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation. Although the risk contribution liability theory was applied
during the Thomas trial, the constitutionality of this theory as applied to the lead pigment cases has not been judicially determined
by the Wisconsin state courts. However, in an unrelated action filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin, Gibson v. American Cyanamid, et al., on November 15, 2010, the district court held that Wisconsin’s risk contribution
theory as applied in that case violated the defendants’ right to substantive due process and is unconstitutionally retroactive. The
district court’s decision in Gibson v. American Cyanamid, et al., was appealed by the plaintiff to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit. On July 24, 2014, the Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment and remanded the case back to the district
court for further proceedings. On January 16, 2015, the defendants filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court
seeking review of the Seventh Circuit’s decision, and on May 18, 2015, the United States Supreme Court denied the defendants’
petition. The case is currently pending in the district court.
The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin consolidated three cases (Ravon Owens v. American
Cyanamid, et al., Cesar Sifuentes v. American Cyanamid, et al., and Glenn Burton, Jr. v. American Cyanamid, et al.) for purposes of
trial. A trial was held in May 2019 and resulted in a jury verdict for the three plaintiffs in the amount of $2.0 million each for a total
of $6.0 million against the Company and two other defendants (Armstrong Containers Inc. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours). After
post-trial motions resulted in the damages award to plaintiff Glenn Burton, Jr. being reduced to $800,000, the Company filed a
notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On April 15, 2021, the Seventh Circuit reversed
the judgments and held that the Company was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims filed by the three plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs filed a petition with the Seventh Circuit on April 27, 2021, seeking a rehearing en banc and, in the alternative, a request
for certification of questions to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The plaintiffs’ petition was denied by the Seventh Circuit on May 12,
2021.
In Maniya Allen, et al. v. American Cyanamid, et al., also pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin, cases involving six of the 146 plaintiffs were selected for discovery. In Dijonae Trammell, et al. v. American Cyanamid,
et al., also pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, discovery for one of the three plaintiffs
was consolidated with the six Allen cases referenced above. The parties selected four of the cases to proceed to expert discovery
and to prepare for trial. The district court previously issued an order scheduling trial in the four cases to commence on June 15,
2020, but the trial date was continued due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and no new trial date has been scheduled.
On May 20, 2021, the Company and the three other defendants filed motions for summary judgment to dismiss the claims of all
plaintiffs currently pending in the district court as a result of the Seventh Circuit’s decision in favor of the Company in the Owens,
Sifuentes and Burton cases. The plaintiffs filed their briefs in opposition to the defendants’ motions for summary judgment on
November 22, 2021. The defendants filed replies in support of their motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2021. The
parties are awaiting the district court’s decision.
On August 24, 2021, the plaintiff in Arrieona Beal v. Armstrong Containers, Inc., et al. filed an amended complaint in Milwaukee
County Circuit Court, naming the Company and other alleged former lead pigment manufacturers as defendants pursuant to the risk
contribution liability theory. The defendants answered the plaintiff’s complaint on December 17, 2021. The Company intends to
vigorously defend this litigation.
Other lead-based paint and lead pigment litigation. In Mary Lewis v. Lead Industries Association, et al. pending in the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Illinois, parents seek to recover the cost of their children’s blood lead testing against the Company and three
other defendants that made (or whose alleged corporate predecessors made) white lead pigments. The circuit court had certified a
statewide class and a Chicago subclass of parents or legal guardians of children who lived in high-risk zip codes identified by the
Illinois Department of Health and who were screened for lead toxicity between August 1995 and February 2008. Excluded from the
class were those parents or guardians who have incurred no expense, liability or obligation to pay for the cost of their children’s
blood lead testing. In 2017, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the three named plaintiffs have not
paid and have no obligation or liability to pay for their children’s blood lead testing because Medicaid paid for the children of two
plaintiffs and private insurance paid for the third plaintiff without any evidence
72
Table of Contents
of a co-pay or deductible. The circuit court granted the motion, but on September 7, 2018, the appellate court reversed with respect
to the two plaintiffs for whom Medicaid paid for their children’s testing. Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois, and
on May 21, 2020, the Supreme Court reversed the appellate court’s judgment, affirmed the circuit court’s summary judgment
dismissing the claims of the two plaintiffs for whom Medicaid paid for their children’s testing, and remanded the case for further
proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision. On August 19, 2020, the defendants filed their renewed motion for class
decertification and entry of final judgment with the circuit court. The parties filed their respective briefs on the motion, and oral
argument occurred on February 4, 2021.
On March 8, 2021, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services filed a petition to intervene and a proposed amended
complaint, which would eliminate the class and all prior claims by individual plaintiffs and would propose a subrogation claim by
the State agency to recover its expenditures for blood lead testing. Defendants opposed the petition to intervene, and briefing on the
petition concluded. A hearing on the petition to intervene occurred on August 10, 2021.
On October 8, 2021, the circuit court entered an order granting the defendants’ motion for decertification of the class, denying the
petition to intervene by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, and noting that an entry of final judgment in the
defendants’ favor was now appropriate. On October 19, 2021, the circuit court entered final judgment in favor of the defendants.
On November 5, 2021, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services filed a Notice of Appeal with the Appellate Court
of Illinois, First District.
Insurance coverage litigation. The Company and its liability insurers, including certain underwriters at Lloyd’s of London,
initiated legal proceedings against each other to determine, among other things, whether the costs and liabilities associated with the
abatement of lead pigment are covered under certain insurance policies issued to the Company. The insurers’ action, which was
filed on February 23, 2006 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, has been dismissed.
The Company’s action, filed on March 3, 2006 in the Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, previously was stayed and
inactive. On January 9, 2019, the Company filed an unopposed motion to lift the stay with the trial court, which was granted,
allowing the case to proceed. On June 28, 2019, the Company and its liability insurers each filed separate motions for summary
judgment seeking various forms of relief. The trial court entered an order on December 4, 2020, granting the insurers’ motion for
summary judgment, denying the Company’s motion, and entering final judgment in favor of the insurers. The trial court sided with
the Company on all of the issues presented, except one. On December 21, 2020, the Company filed a notice of appeal to the Court
of Appeals of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Eighth Appellate District, and the insurers filed cross-appeals. Briefing on the issues
concluded, and oral argument occurred on August 25, 2021. The insurers then filed on January 13, 2022, a motion for leave to file a
supplemental brief to address the Eighth Appellate District’s recent decision in Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Discount Drug Mart, Inc. The
Company filed a response to the insurers’ motion on January 19, 2022. The parties are awaiting the appellate court’s decision.
An ultimate loss in the insurance coverage litigation would mean that insurance proceeds could be unavailable under the policies at
issue to mitigate any ultimate abatement related costs and liabilities. The Company has not recorded any assets related to these
insurance policies or otherwise assumed that proceeds from these insurance policies would be received in estimating any contingent
liability accrual. Therefore, an ultimate loss in the insurance coverage litigation without a determination of liability against the
Company in the lead pigment or lead-based paint litigation will have no impact on the Company’s results of operation, liquidity or
financial condition. As previously stated, however, except with respect to the litigation in California discussed above, the Company
has not accrued any amounts for the lead pigment or lead-based paint litigation and any significant liability ultimately determined
to be attributable to the Company relating to such litigation may result in a material impact on the Company’s results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued.
Other litigation. On December 18, 2019, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the Commissioner of the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, and the Administrator of the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund filed a lawsuit
against the Company in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division in Camden County, New Jersey. The plaintiffs seek to
recover natural resource damages, punitive damages, and litigation fees and costs, as well as other costs, damages, declaratory
relief, and penalties pursuant to New Jersey state statutes and common law theories in connection with the alleged discharge of
hazardous substances and pollutants at the Company’s Gibbsboro, New Jersey site, a former manufacturing plant and related
facilities. On February 21, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss. Briefing concluded, and a hearing on the motion to
dismiss occurred. The trial court entered an order on August 26, 2021, granting and denying the Company’s motion in part. On
September 15, 2021, the Company filed a petition for leave to appeal the trial court’s ruling regarding the refusal to dismiss
plaintiffs’ statutory penalty claims. On October 21, 2021, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey denied the
petition. The Company also answered the plaintiffs’ complaint on September 21, 2021.

NOTE 12 – ESOP
As of December 31, 2021, 42,721 employees contributed to the Company’s ESOP, a voluntary defined contribution plan available
to all eligible salaried employees. Participants are allowed to contribute, on a pretax or after-tax basis, up to the lesser of fifty
percent of their annual compensation or the maximum dollar amount allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
matches one hundred percent of all contributions up to six percent of eligible employee contributions. Such participant
contributions may be invested in a variety of investment funds or a Company common stock fund and may be exchanged between
investments as directed by the participant. Participants are permitted to diversify both future and prior Company matching
contributions previously allocated to the Company common stock fund into a variety of investment funds.
The Company made contributions to the ESOP on behalf of participating employees, representing amounts authorized by
employees to be withheld from their earnings, of $224.3 million, $196.5 million and $180.5 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. The Company’s matching contributions to the ESOP charged to operations were $133.7 million, $120.0 million and
$111.9 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2021, there were 20,639,085 shares of the Company’s common stock being held by the ESOP, representing 7.9%
of the total number of voting shares outstanding. Shares of Company common stock credited to each member’s account under the
ESOP are voted by the trustee under instructions from each individual plan member. Shares for which no instructions are received
are voted by the trustee in the same proportion as those for which instructions are received.
NOTE 13 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The 2006 Employee Plan authorizes the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of Directors, to issue or transfer up to an
aggregate of 71,100,000 shares of common stock, plus any shares relating to awards that expire, are forfeited or canceled. The
Company issues new shares upon exercise of option rights and vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs). The 2006 Employee Plan
permits the granting of option rights, appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares and performance units to
eligible employees. At December 31, 2021, no appreciation rights, performance shares or performance units had been granted under
the 2006 Employee Plan. Shares available for future grants under the 2006 Employee Plan were 9,923,164 at December 31, 2021.
The 2006 Stock Plan for Nonemployee Directors (Nonemployee Director Plan) authorizes the Board of Directors, or a committee
of the Board of Directors, to issue or transfer up to an aggregate of 600,000 shares of common stock, plus any shares relating to
awards that expire, are forfeited or canceled. The Nonemployee Director Plan permits the granting of option rights, appreciation
rights, restricted stock and RSUs to members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of the Company. At December 31,
2021, no option rights or appreciation rights had been granted under the Nonemployee Director Plan. Shares available for future
grants under the Nonemployee Director Plan were 229,123 at December 31, 2021.
The cost of the Company’s stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with the Stock Compensation Topic of the ASC. At
December 31, 2021, the Company had total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $149.8 million that is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.06 years. Stock-based compensation expense during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was
$97.7 million, $95.9 million and $101.7 million, respectively. The related tax benefit was $24.1 million, $23.6 million and $25.1
million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excess tax benefits from share-based payments are recognized as an income tax
benefit in the statement of consolidated income when options are exercised and RSUs vest. For the years ended December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s excess tax benefit from options exercised and RSUs vested reduced the income tax provision
by $108.7 million, $94.7 million, and $65.2 million respectively.
Option Rights
The fair value of the Company’s option rights was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions for all options granted:
2021 2020 2019
Risk-free interest rate 1.11 % .39 % 1.64 %
Expected life of option rights 5.05 years 5.05 years 5.05 years
Expected dividend yield of
stock .75 % .88 % .87 %
Expected volatility of stock 26.8 % 26.7 % 23.2 %
75
Table of Contents
The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. The expected life of option rights was
calculated using a scenario analysis model. Historical data was used to aggregate the holding period from actual exercises, post-
vesting cancellations and hypothetical assumed exercises on all outstanding option rights. The expected dividend yield of stock is
the Company’s best estimate of the expected future dividend yield. Expected volatility of stock was calculated using historical and
implied volatilities.
Grants of option rights for non-qualified and incentive stock options have been awarded to certain officers and key employees
under the 2006 Employee Plan. The option rights generally become exercisable to the extent of one-third of the optioned shares for
each full year following the date of grant and generally expire ten years after the date of grant. Unrecognized compensation
expense with respect to option rights granted to eligible employees amounted to $79.5 million at December 31, 2021. The
unrecognized compensation expense is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period, net of estimated
forfeitures based on historical activity, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.09 years.
The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $68.63, $46.56 and
$38.80, respectively. The total intrinsic value of option rights exercised during 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $485.8 million, $407.9
million and $285.8 million, respectively. The total fair value of options vested during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $53.2 million,
$51.0 million and $43.2 million, respectively. There were no outstanding option rights for nonemployee directors at December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019.

4.95 years, respectively.
RSUs
Grants of RSUs, which generally require three years of continuous employment from the date of grant before vesting and receiving
the stock without restriction, have been awarded to certain officers and key employees under the 2006 Employee Plan. The
February 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants consisted of performance-based awards that vest at the end of a three-year period based on
the Company’s achievement of specified financial and operating performance goals relating to earnings per share and return on net
assets employed.
Unrecognized compensation expense with respect to grants of RSUs to eligible employees amounted to $68.6 million at
December 31, 2021 and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 0.91 years.
Grants of RSUs have been awarded to nonemployee directors under the Nonemployee Director Plan. These grants generally vest
and stock is received without restriction to the extent of one-third of the RSUs for each year following the date of grant.
Unrecognized compensation expense with respect to grants of RSUs to nonemployee directors amounted to $1.7 million at
December 31, 2021 and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period and is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.94 years.

NOTE 15 – DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING
In February 2020, the Company entered into two U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contracts to hedge the Company’s net
investment in its European operations. The contracts, which were designated as net investment hedges, have a notional value of
$500.0 million and $244.0 million, respectively, with maturity dates of June 1, 2024 and November 15, 2021, respectively. During
the term of the $500.0 million contract, the Company will pay fixed-rate interest in Euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S.
Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of the Company’s U.S. Dollar denominated fixed-rate debt to Euro denominated
fixed-rate debt. During the term of the $244.0 million contract, the Company paid floating-rate interest in Euros and received
floating-rate interest in U.S. Dollars. Prior to the maturity of the $244.0 million floating-rate contract in November 2021, the
Company entered into a new $244.0 million U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contract with a maturity date of June 1, 2027
to effectively amend and extend the original contract. During the term of this $244.0 million fixed-rate contract, which is
designated as a net investment hedge, the Company will pay fixed-rate interest in Euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S.
Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of the Company’s U.S. Dollar denominated fixed-rate debt to Euro denominated
fixed-rate debt.

On May 9, 2019, the Company entered into a U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contract with a total notional amount of
$400.0 million to hedge the Company’s net investment in its European operations. This contract was designated as a net investment
hedge and had a maturity date of January 15, 2022. During the term of the contract, the Company paid fixed-rate interest in Euros
and received fixed-rate interest in U.S. Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of the Company’s U.S. Dollar denominated
fixed-rate debt to Euro denominated fixed-rate debt. In February 2020, the Company settled its $400.0 million U.S. Dollar to Euro
cross currency swap contract. At the time of the settlement, an unrealized gain of $11.8 million, net of tax, was recognized in
AOCI.
The following table summarizes the balance sheet location of the cross currency swaps. See Note 16 for additional information on

NOTE 16 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the ASC applies to the Company’s financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. The guidance applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. Under
the guidance, assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
Level 2: Significant other observable inputs
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs
There were no assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis classified as Level 3 at December 31, 2021, 2020
and 2019. Except for the acquisition and divestiture-related fair value measurements described in Note 3, there were no assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The following table summarizes the Company’s assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Table of Contents
The deferred compensation plan assets consist of the investment funds maintained for the future payments under the Company’s
executive deferred compensation plans, which are structured as rabbi trusts. The investments are marketable securities accounted
for under the Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the ASC. The level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices
multiplied by the number of shares. The level 2 investments are valued based on vendor quotes. The cost basis of the investment
funds was $63.0 million, $58.1 million, and $54.8 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Qualified Replacement Plan assets consist of investment funds maintained for future contributions to the Company’s domestic
defined contribution plan. See Note 7. The investments are marketable securities accounted for under the Debt and Equity
Securities Topic of the ASC. The investments are valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares. The cost
basis of the investment funds was $86.9 million, $159.6 million and $46.7 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.
The net investment hedge liability is the fair value of the cross currency swaps (see Note 15). The fair value is based on a valuation
model that uses observable inputs, including interest rate curves and foreign currency rate.
The carrying amounts reported for Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term borrowings approximate fair value.
The fair value of the Company’s publicly traded debt is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the Company’s non-
publicly traded debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates
for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The Company’s publicly traded debt and non-traded debt are classified as level 1 and
level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of the
Company’s publicly traded debt and non-traded debt.

NOTE 17 – REVENUE
The Company manufactures and sells paint, stains, supplies, equipment and floor covering through company-operated stores,
branded and private label products through retailers, and a broad range of industrial coatings directly to global manufacturing
customers through company-operated branches. A large portion of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time and
made to customers who are not engaged in a long-term supply agreement or any form of contract with the Company. These sales
are paid for at the time of sale in cash, credit card or on account with the vast majority of customers having terms between 30 and
60 days, not to exceed one year. Many customers who purchase on account take advantage of early payment discounts offered by
paying within 30 days of being invoiced. The Company estimates variable consideration for these sales on the basis of both
historical information and current trends to estimate the expected amount of discounts to which customers are likely to be entitled.
The remaining revenue is governed by long-term supply agreements and related purchase orders (“contracts”) that specify shipping
terms and aspects of the transaction price including rebates, discounts and other sales incentives, such as advertising support.
Contracts are at standalone pricing. The performance obligation in these contracts is determined by each of the individual purchase
orders and the respective stated quantities, with revenue being recognized at a point in time when obligations under the terms of the
agreement are satisfied. This generally occurs with the transfer of control of our products to the customer. Sales, value add, and
other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
Refer to Note 21 for the Company’s disaggregation of net sales by reportable segment. As the reportable segments are aligned by
similar economic factors, trends and customers, this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Approximately 80% of the Company’s net external sales are in the
Company’s North America region (which is comprised of the United States, Canada and the Caribbean region), slightly less than
10% in the EMEAI region (Europe, Middle East, Africa and India), with the remaining global regions accounting for the residual
balance. No individual country outside of the United States is individually significant.
79
Table of Contents
The Company has made payments or credits for rebates or incentives at the beginning of a long-term contract where future revenue
is expected and before satisfaction of performance obligations. Under these circumstances, the Company recognizes a contract asset
and amortizes these prepayments over the expected benefit life of the long-term contract typically on a straight-line basis.
The majority of variable consideration in the Company’s contracts include a form of volume rebate, discounts, and other incentives,
where the customer receives a retrospective percentage rebate based on the amount of their purchases. In these situations, the
rebates are accrued as a fixed percentage of sales and recorded as a reduction of net sales until paid to the customer per the terms of
the contract. Forms of variable consideration such as tiered rebates, whereby a customer receives a retrospective price decrease
dependent on the volume of their purchases, are calculated using a forecasted percentage to determine the most likely amount to
accrue. Management creates a baseline calculation using historical sales and then utilizing forecast information, estimates the
anticipated sales volume each quarter to calculate the expected reduction to sales. The remainder of the transaction price is fixed as
agreed upon with the customer, limiting estimation of revenues including constraints.
The Company’s Accounts receivable and current and long-term contract assets and liabilities are summarized in the following table.

Balance at December 31, 2021 2,352.4 60.9 131.2 259.8 9.2 
The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results
from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the customer’s payment.
Provisions for estimated returns are established and the expected costs continue to be recognized as contra-revenue per ASC 606
when the products are sold. The Company only offers an assurance type warranty on products sold, and there is no material service
to the customer beyond fixing defects that existed at the time of sale and no warranties are sold separately.
Warranty liabilities are excluded from the table above. Amounts recognized during the year from deferred revenue were not
material. The Company records a right of return liability within each of its operations to accrue for expected customer returns.
Historical actual returns are used to estimate future returns as a percentage of current sales. Obligations for returns and refunds
were not material individually or in the aggregate.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company’s primary allowance for credit losses is the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts
reduces the Accounts receivable balance to the estimated net realizable value. The Company reviews the collectibility of the
Accounts receivable balance each reporting period and estimates the allowance based on historical bad debt experience, aging of
accounts receivable, current creditworthiness of customers, current economic factors, as well as reasonable and supportable
forward-looking information. Accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if a final determination of
uncollectibility is made. All provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts are included in Selling, general and administrative
expenses.
The following table summarizes the movement in the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts:
2021 2020 2019
Beginning balance $ 53.5 $ 36.5 $ 45.9 
Adjustment upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 3.0 
Bad debt expense 33.8 56.8 53.1 
Uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries (38.4) (42.8) (62.5)
Ending balance $ 48.9 $ 53.5 $ 36.5 
The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective transition method, electing to not restate prior periods.

filed a lawsuit against the Brazilian tax authorities to challenge the inclusion of ICMS on the PIS/COFINS tax base. During 2019,
Sherwin-Williams Brazil received a favorable final, non-appealable decision against the Brazilian tax authorities. Upon
clarification regarding monetization of the credits, the Company recognized the benefit.
Other income and Other expense included items of revenue, gains, expenses and losses that were unrelated to the primary business
purpose of the Company. There were no items within Other income or Other expense that were individually significant in

NOTE 19 – INCOME TAXES
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, global legislation concerning income taxes was passed throughout 2020. The Company
assessed the applicability of the stimulus elements within the global legislation, and it did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements in 2020 or 2021. The primary benefit to the Company was the delay of payment of
U.S. federal and state income taxes as well as U.S. federal payroll withholding taxes until subsequent periods.
During 2019, the Company recorded an increase to the tax provision of $74.3 million related to the reversal of all net tax benefits
recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds with DC Solar Solutions, Inc. and certain of its
affiliates. The facts relating to the Company’s investments in the funds continue to be developed. There were no adjustments
recognized in the Company’s tax provision for this matter in 2020 or 2021.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes using the enacted tax rates and laws that are currently in
effect.
Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as
follows:
2021 2020 2019
Deferred tax assets:
Environmental and other similar items $ 73.2 $ 82.9 $ 83.5 
Employee related and benefit items 170.3 166.6 129.3 
Operating lease liabilities 463.1 448.9 430.6

Other items 33.3 31.7 28.1 
Total deferred tax liabilities 1,604.0 1,709.7 1,759.0 
Net deferred tax liabilities $ 705.4 $ 778.5 $ 911.6 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s net deferred income tax liability relates primarily to deferred tax liabilities recorded for
intangible assets acquired through the Valspar acquisition.
Netted against the Company’s other deferred tax assets were valuation allowances of $97.2 million, $104.6 million and $84.6
million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in the valuation allowance in 2021 is primarily due to the
utilization of certain foreign tax credits during the year. The Company has $17.6 million of domestic net operating loss
carryforwards acquired through acquisitions that have expiration dates through the tax year 2037, foreign tax credits of $15.3
million that expire in calendar years 2028 through 2031 and foreign net operating losses of $327.5 million. The foreign net
operating losses are related to various jurisdictions that provide for both indefinite carryforward periods and others with
carryforward periods that range from the tax years 2021 to 2041.

Under provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), the Company received an income tax benefit of $12.2 million, $12.0
million and $10.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to foreign derived intangible income and incurred income
tax expense of $2.7 million, $7.0 million and $7.9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to Global Intangible Low
Taxed Income (GILTI). The Company has made an accounting policy election to record GILTI as a period cost.
Significant components of income before income taxes as used for income tax purposes, were as follows:
2021 2020 2019
Domestic $ 2,106.8 $ 2,317.9 $ 1,899.6 
Foreign 141.8 201.3 82.2 
$ 2,248.6 $ 2,519.2 $ 1,981.8 
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate follows: 
2021 2020 2019

Tax credit reversal — — 3.7 
Other - net (0.1) 0.7 0.8 
Reported effective tax rate 17.1 % 19.4 % 22.2 %
The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits related to
employee share-based payments and the net favorable impact of various other tax benefits received by the Company in 2021
compared to 2020.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 income tax returns. As a result of these audits, certain
adjustments have been assessed. The Company has filed a protest, submitted additional information for consideration, and is
currently in the appeals process with the IRS. The Company continues to evaluate the adjustments and believes that it is adequately
reserved for any potential exposure. As of December 31, 2021, the U.S. federal statute of limitations has not expired for the 2013
through 2020 tax years.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company is subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations for the tax years of 2014 through 2020. In
addition, the Company is subject to state and local income tax examinations for the tax years 1998 through 2021.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
2021 2020 2019
Balance at beginning of year $ 227.0 $ 203.0 $ 89.5 
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 14.0 13.8 14.9 
Additions for tax positions of prior years 23.1 16.4 107.9 
Reductions for tax positions of prior years (22.1) (3.3) (3.6)
Settlements (5.6) (2.0) — 
Lapses of statutes of limitations (7.9) (0.9) (5.7)
Balance at end of year $ 228.5 $ 227.0 $ 203.0 
The increase in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily related to the reversal of benefits recognized in previous tax years from
federal research and development credits, partially offset by a number of positions taken on prior year income tax returns filed in
the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions that were no longer deemed to be at risk. At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $218.9 million, $216.3 million and
$195.3 million, respectively.
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 is $13.7 million related to tax positions for which it is
reasonably possible that the total amounts could significantly change during the next twelve months. This amount represents a
decrease in unrecognized tax benefits comprised primarily of items related to federal audits of partnership investments and expiring
statutes in federal, foreign and state jurisdictions.
The Company classifies all income tax related interest and penalties as income tax expense. During the year ended December 31,
2021, there was a decrease in income tax interest and penalties of $2.7 million. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, there was an increase in income tax interest and penalties of $4.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The Company
accrued $26.4 million, $30.3 million and $26.2 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for the potential
payment of interest and penalties.

NOTE 21 – REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing
performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC.
The Company has three reportable operating segments: The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings
Group (individually, a Reportable Segment and collectively, the Reportable Segments). Factors considered in determining the three
Reportable Segments of the Company include the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to
the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial
information and information presented to the Board of Directors. The Company reports all other business activities and immaterial
operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative segment.
The Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer because he has final authority over performance
assessment and resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations of the Company, the CODM regularly receives
discrete financial information about each Reportable Segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information
about certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for
performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the
Reportable Segments based on segment profit or loss and cash generated from operations. The accounting policies of the
Reportable Segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of this report.
The Americas Group consisted of 4,859 company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Latin America and
the Caribbean region at December 31, 2021. Each store in this segment is engaged in servicing the needs of architectural and
industrial paint contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. These stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams and other controlled
brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products. The majority of
these products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Brands Group. In addition, each store sells select
purchased associated products. The Americas Group sells a variety of architectural paints, coatings and related products through
dedicated dealers, home centers, distributors, hardware stores and other retailers throughout Latin America. The Americas Group
meets regional customer demands through developing, licensing, manufacturing, distributing and selling a variety of architectural
paints, coatings and related products in North and South America. The loss of any single customer would not have a material
adverse effect on the business of this segment. At December 31, 2021, The Americas Group consisted of operations from
subsidiaries in 10 foreign countries. During 2021, this segment opened 85 net new stores, consisting of 92 new stores opened (76 in
the United States, 3 in Canada, 10 in Mexico and 3 in South America) and 7 stores closed (6 in the United States and 1 in South
America). In 2020 and 2019, this segment opened 16 and 62 net new stores, respectively. The CODM uses discrete financial
information about The Americas Group, supplemented with information by geographic region, product type and customer type, to
assess performance of and allocate resources to The Americas Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, The
Americas Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also
considered a Reportable Segment.
The Consumer Brands Group supplies a broad portfolio of branded and private-label architectural paint, stains, varnishes, industrial
products, wood finishes products, wood preservatives, applicators, corrosion inhibitors, aerosols, caulks and adhesives to retailers
and distributors throughout North America, as well as in China and Europe. The Consumer Brands Group also supports the
Company’s other businesses around the world with new product research and development, manufacturing, distribution and
logistics. Approximately 62% of the total sales of the Consumer Brands Group in 2021 were intersegment transfers of products
primarily sold through The Americas Group. At December 31, 2021, the Consumer Brands Group consisted of operations in the
United States and subsidiaries in 5 foreign countries. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private-label products is
performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third-party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-
user of the product. The Consumer Brands Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of
the sales and related profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to
operational efficiencies, capacity, health and safety at sites currently in operation. The CODM uses discrete financial information
about the Consumer Brands Group, supplemented with information by product type and customer type, to assess performance of
and allocate resources to the Consumer Brands Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Consumer Brands
Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered
a Reportable Segment.
The Performance Coatings Group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial (metal and
plastic) applications, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings, coil coatings, packaging coatings and performance-based
resins and colorants worldwide. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams and
other controlled brand products are distributed through The Americas Group and this segment’s 282 company-operated branches
and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third-party distributors.
The Performance Coatings Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the
segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the®

overall profitability of the segment. During 2021, this segment opened 1 new branch and closed 1 branch for no net change in the
number of branches operated. At December 31, 2021, the Performance Coatings Group consisted of operations in the United States
and subsidiaries in 44 foreign countries. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Performance Coatings Group,
supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate
resources to the Performance Coatings Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Performance Coatings Group
as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a
Reportable Segment.
The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate headquarters site and the operations
of a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management and leasing of non-retail properties held
primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Also included in the
Administrative segment was interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and
environmental-related matters, and other expenses that were not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. In addition, the
Administrative segment includes the $111.9 million pre-tax loss on the Wattyl divestiture recognized during the year ended
December 31, 2021. See Notes 3 and 18 for additional information on the Wattyl divestiture. Sales of this segment represented
external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary
businesses. The Administrative segment did not include any significant foreign operations. Gains and losses from the sale of
property were not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment.
Net external sales of all consolidated foreign subsidiaries were $4.223 billion, $3.581 billion and $3.679 billion for 2021, 2020 and
2019, respectively.
Long-lived assets consisted of Property, plant and equipment, Goodwill, Intangible assets, Operating lease right-of-use assets,
Deferred pension assets and Other assets. The aggregate total of long-lived assets for the Company was $15.613 billion, $15.810
billion and, $15.865 billion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Long-lived assets of consolidated foreign
subsidiaries totaled $2.785 billion, $3.167 billion and $3.211 billion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Total Assets of the Company were $20.667 billion, $20.402 billion and $20.496 billion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Total assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries were $4.653 billion, $4.834 billion and $4.829 billion, which
represented 22.5%, 23.7% and 23.6% of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
No single geographic area outside the United States was significant relative to consolidated net external sales or consolidated long-
lived assets. Export sales and sales to any individual customer were each less than 10 percent of consolidated sales to unaffiliated
customers during all years presented.
In the reportable segment financial information that follows, Segment profit was total net sales and intersegment transfers less
operating costs and expenses. Identifiable assets were those directly identified with each reportable segment. The Administrative
segment assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, deferred pension assets and headquarters property,
plant and equipment. The margin for each reportable segment was based upon total net sales and intersegment transfers. Domestic
intersegment transfers were primarily accounted for at the approximate fully absorbed manufactured cost, based on normal capacity
volumes, plus customary distribution costs for paint products. Non-paint domestic and all international intersegment transfers were
accounted for at values comparable to normal unaffiliated customer sales. All intersegment transfers are eliminated within the
Administrative segment.
