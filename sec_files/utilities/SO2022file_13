The Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating
facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources
of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of
the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission
system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System – Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power"
herein.
Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered
into for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into
various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review
of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load
retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional electric
operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further
I-1
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented
at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. In February 2021, Southern Company joined a filing at the FERC
proposing a Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) that included many of the other electric service providers in the
Southeast. In October 2021, the proposal became effective by operation of law following a tie vote by the FERC, subject to certain
rehearing requests. A petition for appeal has been filed regarding the FERC's orders. SEEM is an extension of the existing bilateral
market where participants will use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is
consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. SEEM is expected to begin service in mid-2022. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot be determined at this time.
The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated
as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are
administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The
fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an
effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service
requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized
economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost
energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use
in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern
Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations
thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions
with third parties. In connection with the sale of former subsidiary Gulf Power in January 2019, an appendix was added to the IIC
setting forth terms and conditions governing Gulf Power's continued participation in the IIC for a defined transition period. On
December 21, 2021, NextEra Energy provided a 180-day notice of its intention to leave the Southern Company power pool.
Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are
furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's
existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to
develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation – Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional
information.
Southern Power
Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects,
and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks
opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of
partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for
differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with
investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and
industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under
long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating
companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric
transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's
future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets,
as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern
Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the
majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business
activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – OVERVIEW – "Business Activities" in Item 7 herein.
Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the
Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company
power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue natural gas and renewable generation facilities, either
wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2021, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in
part with various partners, totaled 12,446 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,066 MWs of nameplate
capacity owned by its subsidiaries). See "Traditional Electric Operating Companies" herein for additional information on the
Southern Company power pool.
I-2
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at
differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling member and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the
partnerships. At December 31, 2021, Southern Power had eight tax equity partnership arrangements where the tax equity investors
receive substantially all of the tax benefits from the facilities, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power holds
controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.
See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions,
dispositions, construction, and development projects.
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners,
based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-
service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the
facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment
coverage ratio at December 31, 2021 was 95% through 2026 and 92% through 2031, with an average remaining contract duration
of approximately 13 years. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 47% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or
equivalent rated counterparties, 42% were with BBB+ to BBB- or equivalent rated counterparties, and 8% were with unrated
entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two
types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all
or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit
or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern
Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from
Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the
requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to
recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on
investment.
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however,
these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable
facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result,
Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy
generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints,
and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the
renewable energy credits.
Southern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues
attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's
current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's
earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through
the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to
the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an
"all other" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including
storage operations and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. Prior to the sale of Sequent on
July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' other businesses also included wholesale gas services. See Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions,
including the sale of Sequent.
Gas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains 76,289
miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential,
commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves approximately 4.3 million customers across four states.
Gas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG
and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of
natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a
7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to
I-3

Fuel Supply
Electric
The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal, as well
as nuclear for Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Southern Company – Electricity Business
– Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION
under "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for
information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2020 and
2021.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the
natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2022, SCS has contracted for 517 Bcf of natural gas supply
under agreements with remaining terms up to 12 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm
natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation,
and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.
The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their
2022 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications,
emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to
remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the
utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to
evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control
equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia
Power – Integrated Resource Plan" and "Mississippi Power – Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for information regarding
plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services,
enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 13 years. Management believes suppliers have
sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the
permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in
rate schedules. See "Rate Matters – Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's
natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.
Natural Gas
Advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural
gas and lower prices for natural gas, which fluctuate over time. Demand increases in 2021 resulted in price increases and high
volatility; however, absent unforeseen developments, forward prices are expected to decline over the next several years.
Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the
regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in
the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas, from Sequent, under
asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Despite the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, the
Atlanta Gas Light and Chattanooga Gas asset management agreements with Sequent remain in place and will expire on March 31,
2023 and March 31, 2025, respectively. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from
interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company
Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset
management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas

Competition
Electric
The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. The competition for
retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological
advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and
environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.
The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973.
Pursuant to standards set forth in this Act, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier.
Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a
connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the
supplier of its choice.
Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to
Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part
by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The
six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas
included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to
certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may
not be made unless the Mississippi PSC grants a CPCN. Areas included in a CPCN that are subsequently annexed to municipalities
may continue to be served by the holder of the CPCN, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On
the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by
the Mississippi PSC.
Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their
respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as
self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors. Further technological
advancements or the implementation of policies in support of alternative energy sources may result in further competition.
Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility
markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success
in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants,
availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.
As of December 31, 2021, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with seven industrial customers. Under the terms of
these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2021, Alabama Power purchased
approximately 83 million KWHs from such companies at a cost of $3 million.
I-8
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2021, Georgia Power had contracts in effect to purchase generation from 36 small IPPs. During 2021, Georgia
Power purchased 4.9 billion KWHs from such companies at a cost of $289 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity
with five cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2021,
Georgia Power purchased 406 million KWHs at a cost of $34 million from these facilities.
As of December 31, 2021, Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the
terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2021, Mississippi Power did not make any such
purchases.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive
franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil
and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are
considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance.
Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation
phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen
energy source for the life of the equipment.
Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:
•changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;
•general economic conditions;
•energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;
•legislation and regulations, including certain city-wide bans on the use of natural gas in new construction;
•the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and
•technological changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.
Southern Company Gas has natural gas-related programs that generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers
and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners
with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances.
Seasonality and Demand
The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. While the electric power
sales of some electric utilities peak in the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, during normal weather conditions,
the Southern Company system's electric power sales peak during both the summer and winter. In most of the areas Southern
Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of the Registrants in the
future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and
natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "General" and – RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS – "Southern Company Gas – Seasonality of Results" in Item 7 herein for information regarding trends in market
demand for electricity and natural gas and the impact of seasonality on Southern Company Gas' business, respectively.
Regulation
States
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their
respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and
regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except
for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See
"Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.
Federal Power Act
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are
all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and
accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at
cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized
to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of
transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.
I-9
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power
Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2021, among the hydroelectric
projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity
of 1.7 million KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially owned by Georgia
Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1.1 million KWs.
In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the
Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting
rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. In 2016, the FERC issued
an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance
also filed multiple appeals of the FERC's 2013 order for the new 30-year license and, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit vacated the order and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. Alabama Power continues to operate the
Coosa River developments under annual licenses issued by the FERC.
In November 2021, Alabama Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa
River. The current Harris Dam project license will expire on November 30, 2023.
In 2018, Georgia Power filed applications to surrender the Langdale and Riverview hydroelectric projects on the Chattahoochee
River upon their license expirations on December 31, 2023. Both projects together represent 1,520 KWs of Georgia Power's hydro
fleet capacity.
In December 2021, Georgia Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project on the Ocmulgee River.
The current Lloyd Shoals project license will expire on December 31, 2023.
Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2026, for the Rocky Mountain project, a pure pumped storage facility of
903,000 KW installed capacity. In December 2021, OPC, as an agent for co-licensees of the project, filed a notice of intent with the
FERC to relicense the project. An application to relicense the project is expected to be filed with the FERC by December 31, 2024.
See PROPERTIES – "Electric – Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2034-2066 for Alabama Power's projects and in the
years 2034-2060 for Georgia Power's projects.
Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may
relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the
original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the
net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other
property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain
requirements that could result in additional costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Regulation
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing
and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as
mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended,
and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment,
protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity
with antitrust laws.
The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. The NRC licenses for
Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and
2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively.
In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs
allowed full construction to begin. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8
herein for additional information.
See Notes 3 and 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Insurance" and "Nuclear Decommissioning," respectively, in Item 8
herein for additional information.

Environmental Laws and Regulations
See "Construction Programs" herein, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
– "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein, and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" and Note 6
to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information concerning environmental laws and regulations impacting the
Registrants.
Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans
Electric
The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout
their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used
and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are
presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill
charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to
encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state
PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final
state PSC approval.
The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate
mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost
recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the
respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi
Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are
recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery
mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at
Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings.
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also
see "Integrated Resource Planning" herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized
by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval
must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC.
The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 14.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021 and are
generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any
changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory
agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction.
These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs,
including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer
consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution
utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption
changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural
gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set
by the Georgia PSC.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility,
allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation,
energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain
cost recovery mechanisms.

Integrated Resource Planning
Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it
maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7
herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of
the traditional electric operating companies, as well as a discussion of the Southern Company system's continued generating fleet
transition.
Alabama Power
Triennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning
process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-
side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric
service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet expected
customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs
any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business.
On October 28, 2021, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC to procure additional generating capacity
through the acquisition of a 743-MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun County,
Alabama. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Georgia Power
Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service
needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must
certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of
actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from
recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. On
January 31, 2022, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP with the Georgia PSC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan" and " – Rate
Plans" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear
Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information on the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the Georgia PSC
certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which allow Georgia Power to recover certain financing costs for construction of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Mississippi Power
In 2019, the Mississippi PSC established the Integrated Resource Planning and Reporting Rule, which requires long-term plans to
best meet the needs of electric utility customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources and considering
transmission needs, including the triennial filing of an IRP, with supply-side updates midway through the three-year cycle, and an
annual report on energy delivery improvements. The IRP filing is not intended to supplant or replace the Mississippi PSC's existing
regulatory processes for petition and approval of CPCNs for new generating resources. On September 9, 2021, the Mississippi PSC
issued an order confirming the conclusion of its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP with no deficiencies identified. See Note 2
to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Human Capital
Southern Company system management is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a sustainable workforce and aims to
foster a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and innovative culture. The Southern Company system's values – safety first, unquestionable
trust, superior performance, and total commitment – guide behavior. The Southern Company system had approximately 27,300
employees on its payroll at December 31, 2021 comprised of the following:
At December 31, 2021
Alabama Power 6,100
Georgia Power 6,500
Mississippi Power 1,000
Southern Power 500
Southern Company Gas 4,500
SCS 3,800
Southern Nuclear 3,800
PowerSecure and other 1,100
Total Southern Company system 27,300
(*)Numbers are rounded to 100s.
All Southern Company system employees are located within the United States. Part-time employees represent less than 1% of total
employees.
Southern Company system management values a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce. Southern Company's subsidiaries
have policies, programs, and processes to help ensure that all groups are represented, included, and fairly treated across all job
levels. The Southern Company Board of Directors and management believe that diversity is important to provide different
perspectives on risk, business strategy, and innovation. Southern Company management leads the Southern Company system's
diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and employee recruitment, retention, and development efforts. The Board, principally
through its Compensation and Management Succession Committee, oversees these efforts. In 2020, Southern Company system
management launched the "Moving to Equity" initiative that focuses on five key areas: talent, workplace environment, community,
political engagement, and supplier diversity. This initiative demonstrates the Southern Company system's commitments, highlights
key results, and tracks progress on long-term goals.
Southern Company system management supports employee resource groups, diversity councils, and inclusion teams to provide
formal networks of colleagues that can help promote belonging, improve employee retention, and support development. At
December 31, 2021, people of color and women represented 29% and 25%, respectively, of the Southern Company system's
workforce.
Southern Company system management recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining an appropriately qualified workforce.
Southern Company system management uses a variety of strategies to attract and retain talent, including working with high schools,
technical schools, universities, and military installations to fill many entry-level positions. The recruiting strategy also includes
partnerships with professional associations and local communities to recruit mid-career talent. The addition of external hires
augments the existing workforce to meet changing business needs, address any critical skill gaps, and supplement and diversify the
Southern Company system's talent pipeline.
The Southern Company system supports the well-being of its employees through a comprehensive total rewards strategy with three
measurable categories: physical, financial, and emotional well-being. The Southern Company system provides competitive salaries,
annual incentive awards for nearly all employees, and health, welfare, and retirement benefits. The Southern Company system has a
qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan and a qualified defined contribution, trusteed 401(k) plan which provides a
competitive company matching contribution. Substantially all Southern Company system employees are eligible to participate in
these plans. There are differences between the pension plan benefit formulas based on when and by which subsidiary an employee
is hired. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. At December 31, 2021, the average age of the Southern
Company system employees was 45 and the average tenure with the Southern Company system was 15 years. Turnover rate,
calculated as the percent of employees that terminated employment with the Southern Company system, including voluntary and
involuntary terminations and retirements, divided by total employees, was 7.7%.
Southern Company system management is committed to developing talent and helping employees succeed by providing
development opportunities along with purposeful people moves as part of individual development plans and succession planning
processes. The Southern Company system has multiple development programs, including programs targeted toward all(*)
I-13
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
employees, high potential employees, first-level managers, managers of managers, and executives. Additionally, Southern
Company system management strives to deliver consistent needs-based training and solutions as workplace needs evolve.
Southern Company system management believes the safety of employees and customers is paramount. The Southern Company
system seeks to meet or exceed applicable laws and regulations while continually improving its safety technologies and processes.
The Southern Company System Safety and Health Council, which includes leaders from each Registrant, works collectively across
the Southern Company system to provide safety leadership, share learning, work collaboratively to address safety-related issues,
and govern the consistency of safety programs. The safety programs are focused on the prevention and elimination of life-altering
events, serious injuries, and fatalities. These programs include continuous process improvements to put critical controls in place to
prevent serious injuries, promote learning, and implement appropriate corrective actions. In 2021, the Southern Company system
had a serious injury rate of 0.05, which represents the number of incidents per 100 employees (calculated by taking the number of
serious injuries multiplied by 200,000 workhours and divided by the total employee workhours during the year). A serious injury is
one that is life-threatening or life-changing for the employee. Serious injury examples, as defined by applicable safety regulators,
include fatalities, amputations, trauma to organs, certain bone fractures, severe burns, and eye injuries.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the Southern Company system has continued to provide essential
services to customers while protecting employees, customers, and communities by implementing applicable business continuity
plans, including teleworking, canceling nonessential business travel, increasing cleaning frequency at business locations,
implementing applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal, state, and local officials, and establishing protocols for
required work on customer premises. To date, these procedures have been effective in maintaining the Southern Company system's
critical operations, while also emphasizing employee, customer, and community safety.
The Southern Company system also has longstanding relationships with labor unions. The traditional electric operating companies,
Southern Nuclear, and the natural gas distribution utilities have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW, which
generally apply to operating, maintenance, and construction employees. These agreements cover wages, benefits, terms of the
pension plans, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and arbitration. The Southern Company system also
partners with the IBEW to provide training programs to develop technical skills and career opportunities.
At December 31, 2021, approximately 32% of Southern Company system employees were covered by agreements with unions,
with agreements expiring between 2023 and 2026.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS –
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries
with the SEC, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries. The risk factors discussed below could
adversely affect a Registrant's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, as well as cause
reputational damage.
UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKS
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial federal, state, and local governmental regulation,
including with respect to rates. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary
approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
Laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services the Southern Company system offers, protection of critical
electric infrastructure assets, transmission planning, reliability, pipeline safety, interaction with wholesale markets, and
relationships with affiliates, among other matters. The Registrants' businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result
in substantial monetary penalties if a Registrant is found to be noncompliant.
The profitability of the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' businesses is largely
dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover their costs and earn a reasonable rate of
return on invested capital. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities seek to recover their
costs, including compliance costs (including a reasonable return on invested capital), through their retail rates, which must be
approved by the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. Such regulators, in a future rate proceeding, may
alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate
refunds may also be required. Additionally, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional electric operating companies
and Southern Power and the rates charged to natural gas transportation customers by Southern Company Gas' pipeline investments
and for some of its storage assets must be approved by the FERC. Changes to Southern Power's and the traditional electric
operating companies' ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC market-based rate authority could affect wholesale rates. Also,
while a small percentage of transmission revenues are collected through wholesale electric tariffs, the majority are collected
through retail rates. Transmission planning could be impacted by FERC policy changes.
The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations
applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries is uncertain. Changes in regulation, the imposition of additional
regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for noncompliance with existing laws or
regulations could influence the operating environment of the Southern Company system and may result in substantial costs.
The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws and satisfying related AROs are significant.
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and
regulations governing air, GHGs, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources.
Compliance with existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs including the settlement of
AROs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates. There is no assurance, however,
that all such costs will be recovered. The Registrants expect future compliance expenditures will continue to be significant.
The EPA has adopted and is implementing regulations governing air and GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act and water quality
under the Clean Water Act. The EPA and certain states have also adopted and continue to propose regulations governing the
disposal and management of CCR at power plant sites. The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on
information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and
discount rates, and the potential compliance methods. The traditional electric operating companies will continue to periodically
update their ARO cost estimates.
Additionally, environmental laws and regulations covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances
could require the Southern Company system to incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites, including certain current and
former operating sites, and locations subject to contractual obligations.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included, but is not limited to,
I-15
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
claims for damages alleged to have been caused by COand other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances, alleged
exposure to regulated substances, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.
Compliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Southern
Company system. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental
expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of
any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may
result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements,
operational changes, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company
system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several
years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the Registrants if such costs cannot continue to
be recovered on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced
demand for electricity and natural gas. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing
and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas.
The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation,
regulation, and emission reduction goals.
Concern and activism about climate change continue to increase and, as a result, demand for energy conservation and sustainable
assets could further increase. Additionally, costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be
significant.
The Southern Company system has robust processes for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks, including a
scenario planning process that is used to inform resource planning decisions in the states in which the traditional electric operating
companies operate. This process relies on information from internal and external sources, which may or may not be accurate in
predicting future outcomes. Each year, the Southern Company system develops scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In
2021, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of
CO emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon.
Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG
emitting economy. However, the ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of
requirements, natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to
recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.
Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future carbon constraints, including, but
not limited to, the imposition of a carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and
direct use in homes and businesses. However, such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain
situations, such as new construction. Additionally, efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors may result in higher
electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand. Future GHG constraints, including those related to methane emissions,
designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and
affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas.
Southern Company has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a
long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural
gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon
concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and
carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continuing to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and
making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing research and development with a
particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and
constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to
a net zero future.

OPERATIONAL RISKS
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are
unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage
technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters,
including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by
environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks,
fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the
Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory
reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system
failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes,
explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar
occurrences.
Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters,
cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by
Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and
contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented
approximately 26% and 28% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended
December 31, 2021. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial
risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive
materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage;
uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives
and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of
insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital
expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.
Damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage,
including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.
The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear
facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security
measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating
and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial
costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world
could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and
existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third
parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.
In addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or
compliance costs that are difficult to predict.
Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks,
such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage
to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near
populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are
subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial
monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.
I-17

Physical attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the Subsidiary Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants face the risk of physical attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation and
storage facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport energy, which could negatively impact their
ability to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities, or, with respect to Southern
Company Gas, its ability to distribute or store natural gas, or otherwise operate its facilities, in the most efficient manner or at all.
In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect on the Southern Company system.
Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized
access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be
physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to
fulfill critical business functions. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of, or inability to remotely access, one or
more key technology systems, networks, or processes could impact the ability of the Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology
systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure
and the technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, denial of service, ransomware,
acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, the Southern Company system faces a heightened risk of
cyberattack. Cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments, have attacked and threatened to attack energy
infrastructure. Various regulators have increasingly stressed that these attacks, including ransomware attacks, and attacks targeting
utility systems and other critical infrastructure, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency.
The Registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain
unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business
operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and
disruption of remote access across the Southern Company system, there has been no material impact on business or operations from
these attacks. However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents,
or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will
not have a material adverse effect in the future.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information,
including personally identifiable information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In
some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third-party service providers. Malicious actors may target
these providers to disrupt the services they provide to the Registrants, or to use those third parties to attack the Registrants. The
Registrants' third-party service providers could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with
respect to their systems.
Internal or external cyber attacks may inhibit the affected Registrant's ability to fulfill critical business functions, including energy
delivery service failures, compromise sensitive and other data, violate privacy laws, and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Any cyber
breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the affected Registrant to penalties and
claims from regulators or other third parties. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses. Additionally, the cost
and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing system protection measures are significant, and they
could materially increase to address ever changing intense, complex, and sophisticated cyber risks.
The Southern Company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required
to operate the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern
Company Gas' natural gas customers.
SCS, on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, purchases fuel for the Southern Company
system's generation fleet from a diverse set of suppliers. Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas
through the natural gas distribution utilities. Natural gas is delivered daily from different regions of the country. This daily supply is
complemented by natural gas supplies stored in both company-owned and third party storage locations. To deliver this daily supply
and stored natural gas, the Southern Company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate
pipelines. Disruption in the supply and/or delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays, weather, labor
relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs, and the
ability of Southern Company Gas to serve its natural gas customers.
The Southern Company system is dependent upon natural gas as a fuel source for its power generation needs, which not only has
the potential to impact the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's costs of generation but the costs
I-18
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
of purchased power as well. The robust growth in supply allowed natural gas prices to moderate and remain below $3 per mmBtu
in recent years; however, demand increases in 2021 resulted in price increases and high volatility. Prices have averaged
approximately $3.75 per mmBtu in 2021, and 2022 prices are expected to be in the same range. Forward prices are expected to
decline over the next several years toward $3 per mmBtu. With the majority of natural gas production being from shale gas
formations, any limitation on shale gas production would be expected to have a material impact on the supply availability as well as
the cost of natural gas. In addition, new demand, in particular exports to Mexico and those from LNG facilities, has grown
significantly and is having greater impact on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's natural gas markets.
The traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal, and related coal supply contracts, for a portion of their
electric generating capacity. The counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of
financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers may be delayed in supplying or may not be required to supply coal under
certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain
their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, and these increased
costs may not be recoverable through rates. The railroad industry is experiencing labor shortages, which could lead to delays in coal
deliveries or increased costs. Additionally, the utility industry is also being impacted by coal delivery challenges associated with
new railroad management systems which favor stable, predictable deliveries and a market trend of shifting railroad capacity away
from coal deliveries to other industries.
In addition to fuel supply, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power also need adequate access to water,
which is drawn from nearby sources, to aid in the production of electricity. Any impact to their water resources could also limit the
ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher
fuel and operating costs.
The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on
sales under PPAs, the success of which depend on PPA counterparties performing their obligations, Southern Company
subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the PPAs, and renewal or replacement of the PPAs for the related
generating capacity.
Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. Southern Power's top three customers,
Southern California Edison, Georgia Power, and Tennessee Valley Authority accounted for 7.4%, 6.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, of
Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The traditional electric operating companies have entered
into PPAs with non-affiliated parties.
The revenues related to PPAs are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations. Although the
credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating
companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater
than predicted or specified in the applicable contract.
Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed
at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If one of these Registrants is unable to replace
expiring PPAs with an acceptable new revenue contract, it may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale
prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. The
failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs, including PPAs related to projects under
construction, could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.
Increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in
customer demand for energy could negatively impact Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers
those investments and earns a return for investors through state regulation. Southern Power's business model is primarily focused
on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy counterparties using a bilateral contract model. A key premise
of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive
cost.
Customers and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the Registrants' ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and
varied products, services, and offerings. Additionally, the risk of global climate change continues to shape customers' and
stakeholders' sustainability goals and energy needs.
New technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for
sustainable assets could change the type of assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery. Advances in these technologies
or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technologies or other alternative methods
of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in
I-19
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self-generation by
customers. Broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions
of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature
may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology,
which may provide for further competition from these alternative sources of generation.
It is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating
facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the
channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power.
Southern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing
similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. Southern Company
Gas competes with natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., where the majority of the existing and proposed high
deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in North America are located.
If new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be
eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution and storage facilities could be
reduced. Additionally, these technology and customer-induced changes to the electric generation business models could change the
risk profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could be
reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets.
The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.
The Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging
workforce without appropriate replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or
unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy
time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with major construction projects and ongoing
operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by
decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer at higher rates as compared to prior years. The Southern
Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure
to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and
expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its
subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses.
The Registrants are subject to risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, disruption to the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for Southern Company and Georgia Power.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most jurisdictions, including in the United States, initially instituted restrictions on travel,
public gatherings, and non-essential business operations. While some jurisdictions, including some in the Southern Company
system's service territory, have relaxed some of these restrictions, some remain and there is no guarantee restrictions will not be
reimposed in the future. These restrictions, as well as changes in individual behavior in response to the pandemic, have
significantly disrupted economic activity in the service territories of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas
distribution utilities and caused volatility in capital markets at certain periods during 2020 and 2021 and could continue to do so in
the future. The Registrants cannot predict the extent or duration of the pandemic, the impact of new variants of COVID-19, the
timing, availability, distribution, or effectiveness of vaccines, anti-virals, or other treatments or preventions for COVID-19,
governmental responsive measures, including vaccine mandates, or the extent of the effects or impacts on the global, national, or
local economy, the capital markets, or the Subsidiary Registrants' customers, suppliers, or operations.
The effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include new or
extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and new or prolonged
reductions in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited
to, new or prolonged reductions in demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of
goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, further increases in costs of necessary equipment,
and further challenges to the development, construction, and/or operation of the Registrants' facilities, including electric generation,
transmission, and distribution assets, the performance of necessary corporate and customer service functions, and access to funds
from financial institutions and capital markets.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities
at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in
Item 8 herein.
I-20
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
CONSTRUCTION RISKS
The Registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities
and may not be able to recover their investments. Also, existing facilities of the Subsidiary Registrants require ongoing
expenditures, including those to meet AROs and other environmental standards and goals.
The businesses of the Registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements,
including transmission, distribution, and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies, generation facilities
for Southern Power, and capital improvements to natural gas distribution facilities for Southern Company Gas. These expenditures
also include those to settle AROs and meet environmental standards and goals. The traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding environmental modifications to certain
existing generating facilities and Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipe in its natural gas distribution system. The
traditional electric operating companies also are in the process of closing ash ponds to comply with the CCR Rule and, where
applicable, state CCR rules. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new
electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems,
and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These projects are long term in nature and in some
cases may include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously
constructed.
The completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have
occurred or may occur, including labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or
vendors; subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of
equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delays; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under
construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety
programs; engineering or design problems; design and other licensing-based compliance matters including, for Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4, inspections and the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related
investigations, reviews, and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel; challenges with start-up
activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or operational performance; and challenges related to the
COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and
geological conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a
result of changes in market interest rates or as a result of project delays.
If a Subsidiary Registrant is unable to complete the development or construction of a project or decides to delay or cancel
construction of a project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that project and may incur substantial cancellation
payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts, as well as other costs associated with the closure and/or
abandonment of the construction project.
In addition, partnership and joint ownership agreements may provide partners or co-owners with certain decision-making authority
in connection with projects under construction, including rights to change ownership allocations and/or cause the cancellation of a
construction project under certain circumstances. Any failure by a partner or co-owner to perform its obligations under the
applicable agreements could have a material negative impact on the applicable project under construction. Southern Power
participates in partnership agreements with respect to a majority of its renewable energy projects and Georgia Power jointly owns
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with other co-owners. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in
Item 8 herein for additional information regarding other jointly-owned facilities.
If construction projects are not completed according to specification, a Registrant may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant
efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income. Furthermore, construction delays associated with renewable projects
could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives.
Even if a construction project (including a joint venture construction project) is completed, the total costs may be higher than
estimated and may not be recoverable through regulated rates, if applicable. In addition, construction delays and contractor
performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern
Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Southern Company and Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of
$3.1 billion ($2.3 billion after tax) through December 31, 2021 to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete construction
and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in
Item 8 herein for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama
Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of
Plant Barry Unit 8.
Once facilities become operational, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant
portions of the traditional electric operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older equipment, even
if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to maintain
I-21
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, to provide safe and reliable operations, and/or to meet related
retirement obligations.
FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS
The electric generation and energy marketing operations of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
Power and the natural gas operations of Southern Company Gas are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs.
The generation, energy marketing, and natural gas operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in energy
prices and fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power, decrease the amount received from the sale of energy,
and/or make electric generating facilities less competitive. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly
over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which could increase the expenses and/or
reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas
distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to
experience underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery
may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including
increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.
The consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the
economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per
customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could
negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.
Outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions
and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the
consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction.
Both federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating
companies and natural gas distribution utilities have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy
efficiency.
Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases
in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.
In addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies
utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can
create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of
changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and
technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.
The operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In
addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary
Registrant.
Electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less
power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
Volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional
electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, and the
natural gas distribution and storage facilities of Southern Company Gas. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in
the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states which
could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can
reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.
In the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any
natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval
of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The traditional electric operating companies from time to
I-22
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
time have experienced and may continue to experience deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances. Additionally, the
applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency may deny or delay recovery of any portion of such costs.
In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events occurring within a Subsidiary Registrant's service territory or
otherwise affecting its customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for energy for extended periods and may
impact customers' ability to perform under existing PPAs.
Acquisitions, dispositions, or other strategic ventures or investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present
risks, including risks not originally contemplated.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions, dispositions, and investments in the past and may
continue to do so. Such actions cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern Company or its subsidiaries. Southern
Company and its subsidiaries continually seek opportunities to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions or
sales of assets. Specifically, Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various
transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new
generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving
entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Additionally, Southern Company Gas has made significant investments in
existing pipelines, most of which are operated by third parties. If one of these agents fails to perform in a proper manner, the value
of the investment could decline and Southern Company Gas could lose part or all of its investment. In addition, Southern Company
Gas is required to fulfill capital obligations to pipeline joint ventures.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for transactional opportunities and anticipated transactions
may not be completed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the
generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk.
These transactions also involve risks, including that they may not result in an increase in income or provide adequate or expected
funds or return on capital or other anticipated benefits; they may result in Southern Company or its subsidiaries entering into new
or additional lines of business, which may have new or different business or operational risks; they may not be successfully
integrated into the acquiring company's operations, internal control processes and/or accounting systems; the due diligence
conducted prior to a transaction may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or may not appropriately
evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks; they may result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash
flow; they may involve retained obligations in connection with transitional agreements or deferred payments related to dispositions
that subject Southern Company or its subsidiaries to additional risk; Southern Company or the applicable subsidiary may not be
able to achieve the expected financial benefits from the use of funds generated by any dispositions; expected benefits of a
transaction may be dependent on the cooperation, performance, or credit risk of a counterparty; minority investments in growth
companies may not result in a positive return on investment; or, for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
Company Gas, costs associated with such investments that were expected to be recovered through regulated rates may not be
recoverable.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and Southern Power owns many of its assets
indirectly through subsidiaries. Each of these companies is dependent on cash flows from their respective subsidiaries to
meet their ongoing and future financial obligations.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and, as such, they have no operations of their own.
Substantially all of Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' and many of Southern Power's respective consolidated assets
are held by subsidiaries. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas' and, to a certain extent, Southern Power's ability to meet
their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and, for
Southern Company, to pay dividends on its common stock, is dependent on the net income and cash flows of their respective
subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Southern
Company, Southern Company Gas, or Southern Power, the respective subsidiaries have financial obligations and, with respect to
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, regulatory restrictions that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service
and preferred stock dividends. In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital
contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their
respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay
dividends on Southern Company's common stock.
A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively
affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain
indebtedness.
There are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas
Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other
I-23
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital,
and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial
risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a
negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or
Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates under applicable term
loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to
below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating
downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness
and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.
Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the
optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a
long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines and storage facilities, replacing
existing pipelines, rewatering storage facilities, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning
processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and
construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution and storage facilities. Inherent risk
exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer
usage patterns, efficiency programs, customer technology adoption, and the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates
to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely
manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated
with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers' rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of
selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully
execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating
companies may not be able to extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at
prices lower than originally intended.
The traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers
under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At
peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available
generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in
the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in
the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or
construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these
costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed
capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed
price PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs.
The businesses of the Registrants and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital through capital
markets and financial institutions.
The Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant
source of liquidity to meet capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the
Registrants or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business
plan will be limited due to weakened capacity to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve
future earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on committed credit facilities as back-up liquidity
for access to low cost money markets. Certain market disruptions, including an economic downturn or uncertainty, bankruptcy or
financial distress at an unrelated utility company, financial institution, or sovereign entity, capital markets volatility and disruption,
either nationally or internationally, changes in tax policy, volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas, actual or
threatened cyber or physical attacks on facilities within the Southern Company system or owned by unrelated utility companies,
future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemic health events, war or threat of war, or the overall health of the utility
and financial institution industries, may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the
issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up
sources of capital. Furthermore, some financial institutions may be limited in their ability to provide capital to the Registrants as a
result of such financial institution's investment criteria, including criteria related to GHG.
Additionally, due to a portion of the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's indebtedness bearing interest at variable
rates based on LIBOR or other floating benchmark rates, the announced phasing out of these rates may adversely affect the
I-24
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
costs of financing. The discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable
impact on contractual relationships in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets and could result in
adverse consequences to the return on, value of, and market for the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's securities and
other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark. Additionally, any replacement benchmark rates may be
relatively new, be fundamentally different from LIBOR, and be more volatile than other benchmark or market rates. The Secured
Overnight Financing Rate has been identified as the current replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR in the United States.
Uncertainty as to the nature of the phase-out of LIBOR and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial markets could
cause interest rates to increase. If sources of capital for the Registrants or Nicor Gas are reduced, capital costs could increase
materially.
Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern
Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings.
The debt and credit agreements of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various
financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of
default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those
covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.
Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning.
The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of
return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan,
changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern
Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences
between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and
other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement
expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts
of cash. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial
statements in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy
obligations to decommission their nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the
funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
"Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.
The financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, natural disasters, and an
increased focus on climate issues, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of
insurance may decrease, and the insurance that the Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums,
and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount
of loss incurred.
The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in
financial losses that negatively impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their
commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in
limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these
contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures,
which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative
contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in
financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of
these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these
instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in
the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.
See Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.
I-25

Future impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' results of
operations.
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value and long-lived assets are assessed for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2021,
goodwill was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, respectively.
In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries have long-lived assets recorded on their balance sheets. To the extent the value
of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, the affected Registrant may be required to incur impairment charges that could
have a material impact on their results of operations. See Notes 7, 9, and 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for
information regarding certain impairment charges at Southern Company and Southern Company Gas.

See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in
Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan" and "Mississippi Power –
Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for information regarding plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired
generating capacity included in the table above.
Except as discussed below under "Titles to Property," the principal plants and other important units of the traditional electric
operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are owned in fee by the respective companies. It is the opinion of management
of each such company that its operating properties are adequately maintained and are substantially in good operating condition, and
suitable for their intended purpose.
Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC.
The line extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana state line. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC is paying a use fee through 2024
covering all expenses and the amortization of the original cost. At December 31, 2021, the unamortized portion was approximately
$5 million.
Mississippi Power owns a lignite mine that was intended to provide fuel for the Kemper IGCC. Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, the
operator of the mine, has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund
all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was
substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2028. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power agreed to seek a restructuring of
their 50% undivided ownership interests in the Plant Daniel coal units such that each of them would, after the restructuring, own
100% of a generating unit. In 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the
coal generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership
interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that
date. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Plant Daniel" in Item 8 herein for
additional information.
In 2021, the maximum demand on the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO was
33,373,000 KWs and occurred on July 29, 2021. The all-time maximum demand of 38,777,000 KWs on the traditional electric
operating companies (including Gulf Power), Southern Power Company, and SEGCO occurred on August 22, 2007. These amounts
exclude demand served by capacity retained by MEAG Power, OPC, and SEPA. The reserve margin for the traditional electric
operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO in 2021 was 36%.

In addition, Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases totaling $42 million, regarding a portion of a 5%
interest in the original cost of Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement
of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under "Commitments" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner holding the
same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein.
Titles to Property
The traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important
units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a
leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron
refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on
these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement
obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided
ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts
relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Assets Subject to Lien" and Note 8 to the
financial statements under "Long-term Debt" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating
companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See "Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein and
Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such
as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way,
which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held
under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not
owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental
entities.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable
for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties
that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the
indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Distribution and Transmission Mains
Southern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas.
These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service
lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 76,289
miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide
for perpetual use.
Storage Assets
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of
approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet
about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of
storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk
associated with seasonal price movements.
Southern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of
approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage
capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas
distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.

other segment. Golden Triangle Storage, Inc. operates a storage facility in Texas consisting of two salt dome caverns. Central
Valley Gas Storage, LLC operates a depleted field storage facility in California.
Jointly-Owned Properties
Southern Company Gas' gas pipeline investments segment has a 50% undivided ownership interest in a 115-mile pipeline facility in
northwest Georgia that was placed in service in 2017. Southern Company Gas also has an agreement to lease its 50% undivided
ownership in the pipeline facility. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
OVERVIEW
Business Activities
Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the
Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the
distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the
traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale
of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements
for additional information.
•The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically
integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale
customers in the Southeast.
•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy
projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks
opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and
sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily
with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as
commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new
generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.
•Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas.
Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee –
and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through
three reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services, which
includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-
reportable segment, all other. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments
also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying
microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications and gas
storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may
pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
Recent Developments
Southern Company
On October 29, 2021, Southern Company completed the sale of assets subject to a domestic leveraged lease to the lessee for
$45 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. On December 13, 2021, Southern Company completed the termination of
its leasehold interest in assets associated with its two international leveraged lease projects and received cash proceeds of
approximately $673 million after the accelerated exercise of the lessee's purchase options. The pre-tax gain associated with the
transaction was approximately $93 million ($99 million gain after tax). See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company" for additional information.
Alabama Power
On September 23, 2021, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Calhoun Power
Company, LLC, which owns and operates a 743-MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun
County, Alabama (Calhoun Generating Station). The completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction and waiver of
certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC. On October 28,
2021, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC to procure additional generating capacity through this
acquisition. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
During 2021, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8. At December 31, 2021, associated project expenditures
included in CWIP totaled approximately $304 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama
Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $181 million. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1,
2022, Alabama Power will apply $126 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $55 million will
be refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
Georgia Power
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status
Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in
which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to complete
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end of the first quarter 2023 and the fourth quarter 2023,
respectively, is $10.4 billion.
Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months
of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4. The continuing effects of the COVID-19
pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
During 2021, Southern Nuclear performed additional construction remediation work necessary to ensure quality and design
standards are met and support system turnovers necessary for Unit 3 hot functional testing, which was completed in July 2021, and
fuel load. As a result of Unit 3 challenges including, but not limited to, construction productivity, construction remediation work,
the pace of system turnovers, spent fuel pool repairs, and the timeframe and duration for hot functional and other testing, at the end
of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for
Unit 3, from those established in January 2021. Through the fourth quarter 2021, the project continued to face these and other
challenges related to the completion of documentation, including inspection records, necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs
and begin fuel load. As a result, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates,
including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan currently targets fuel
load for Unit 3 in the second quarter 2022 and an in-service date during the third quarter 2022 and primarily depends on significant
improvements in overall construction productivity and production levels, the volume of construction remediation work, the pace of
system and area turnovers, and the progression of startup and other testing. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to these
milestone dates, an in-service date during the fourth quarter 2022 or the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 is projected, although any
further delays could result in a later in-service date.
As the result of productivity challenges and temporarily diverting some Unit 4 craft and support resources to Unit 3 construction
efforts, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear also further extended milestone dates for Unit 4
from those established in January 2021. The temporary diversion of Unit 4 resources to support Unit 3 has continued into the first
quarter 2022; therefore, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from
those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan targets an in-service date during the first quarter 2023 for
Unit 4 and primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as
appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electricians and pipefitters, being added and maintained. As the site work plan
includes minimal margin to the milestone dates, an in-service date during the third or fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4 is projected,
although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.
The latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition,
if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE
may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See
Note 8 to the financial statements under "Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" for additional information.
During 2021, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $1.3 billion were assigned to the base capital cost
forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, and
support resources for Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power also increased its total capital cost forecast as of December 31, 2021 by
$99 million to replenish construction contingency.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate
outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in
future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021,
the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021 of $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax),
$264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project
capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during the
prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described in Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters." In addition, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax
charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax), and may be required to record
additional pre-tax charges to income of up to $460 million, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint
ownership agreements based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental costs associated with these provisions will
not be recovered from retail customers. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint
Owner Contracts" for additional information.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors on the construction schedule and budget for Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for
additional information.
Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding
On November 2, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's application to adjust retail base rates to include a portion of
costs related to its investment in Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the common facilities shared between Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
(Common Facilities), as well as the related costs of operation, as modified pursuant to a stipulated agreement between Georgia
Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC. The related increase in annual retail base rates of approximately $302 million includes
recovery of all projected operations and maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of
operation, partially offset by the related production tax credits, and will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in
service. This increase is partially offset by a decrease in the NCCR tariff of approximately $78 million that became effective
January 1, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate
Proceeding" for additional information.
Rate Plans
On November 18, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective
January 1, 2022 resulting in a net increase in annual retail base rates of $157 million. Georgia Power is required to file its next
general base rate case by July 1, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP" for
additional information.
Integrated Resource Plan
On January 31, 2022, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2022 IRP), including a request to decertify and retire Plant Wansley
Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership) by August 31, 2022; Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) by December
31, 2027; and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on
50% ownership through SEGCO) by December 31, 2028.
In the 2022 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2
(approximately $611 million at December 31, 2021), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (approximately $937 million at December 31,
2021), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (approximately $612 million at December 31, 2021) and any remaining unusable materials and
supplies inventories upon each unit's respective retirement dates to a regulatory asset, with recovery periods to be determined in
future base rate cases.
The 2022 IRP also included a request for approval of the capital, operations and maintenance, and CCR ARO costs associated with
ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. The recovery of these costs is expected to be determined in future base rate
cases.
A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2022 IRP is expected in July 2022. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan" for additional
information.

Mississippi Power
During the first half of 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved the following non-fuel rate changes related to Mississippi Power's
annual rate filings for 2021:
•an increase in revenues related to the ad valorem tax adjustment factor of approximately $28 million annually, which became
effective with the first billing cycle of May 2021,
•an increase in revenues related to PEP of approximately $16 million annually, which became effective with the first billing
cycle of April 2021 in accordance with the PEP rate schedule, and
•a decrease in revenues related to the ECO Plan of approximately $9 million annually, which became effective with the first
billing cycle of July 2021.
On September 9, 2021, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the conclusion of its review of Mississippi Power's 2021
IRP with no deficiencies identified. The 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Mississippi
Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (103 MWs each) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026,
respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the
schedule reflects the early retirement of Mississippi Power's 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502
MWs) by the end of 2027.
In accordance with an accounting order issued by the Mississippi PSC on October 14, 2021, Mississippi Power reclassified $49
million of retail costs associated with Hurricanes Zeta and Ida to a regulatory asset to be recovered through PEP over a period to be
determined in Mississippi Power's 2022 PEP proceeding. In addition, on December 7, 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved
Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which requested an increase in retail revenues of approximately $9 million annually
effective with the first billing cycle of March 2022 to restore the property damage reserve.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
On July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent to Williams Field Services Group for a total cash
purchase price of $159 million, including final working capital adjustments. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was
approximately $121 million ($92 million after tax). As a result of the sale, changes in state apportionment rates resulted in $85
million of additional tax expense. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional
information.
During the second and third quarters of 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling $84 million
($67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. On September 27, 2021, PennEast
Pipeline announced that further development of the project is no longer supported, and, as a result, all further development of the
project has ceased. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Key Performance Indicators
In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.7 million electric and
gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on
several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric
and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary
Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – "Southern
Company Gas – Operating Metrics" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating
Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.
The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer
satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices.
The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top
quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" and "Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan" for additional
information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms
that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.
Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced
outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to
customers.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Southern Company
Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $2.4 billion in 2021, a decrease of $726 million, or 23.3%, from
2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.0 billion increase in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 and higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by an increase in natural gas revenues associated
with colder weather in the first quarter 2021 as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 and infrastructure replacement
programs and base rate changes, higher retail electric revenues primarily associated with rates and pricing and sales growth, a
decrease in impairment charges and a gain on termination related to leveraged leases at Southern Holdings, and higher wholesale
electric capacity revenues. See Notes 2, 9, and 15 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction,"
"Southern Company Leveraged Lease," and "Southern Company," respectively, for additional information.
Basic EPS was $2.26 in 2021 and $2.95 in 2020. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based
compensation, was $2.24 in 2021 and $2.93 in 2020. EPS for 2021 and 2020 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.03 per
share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under
"Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Southern Company" for additional information.
Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.62 in 2021 and $2.54 in 2020. In January 2022, Southern Company declared a
quarterly dividend of 66 cents per share. For 2021, the dividend payout ratio was 116% compared to 86% for 2020.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Retail electric revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 8.9%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The significant factors driving this change
are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2021 was primarily due to an increase effective January 1,
2021 in Alabama Power's Rate RSE, net of a related customer refund, and increases at Georgia Power resulting from higher
contributions by commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, fixed residential customer bill
programs, the effects of higher KWH sales on ECCR tariff revenues, and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP,
partially offset by a decrease in Georgia Power's NCCR tariff, both effective January 1, 2021.
Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs,
including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses,
including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have
one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new
plants, and PPA capacity costs.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" for additional information. Also see "Energy
Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and
weather.
Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from
PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the
greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy
revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's
generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern
Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an
increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do
not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy
charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and
maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather
conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power
include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at
market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.
Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:
2021 2020
 (in millions)
Capacity and other $ 550 $ 476 
Energy 1,905 1,469
Total $ 2,455 $ 1,945 
In 2021, wholesale electric revenues increased $510 million, or 26.2%, as compared to 2020 due to increases of $436 million in
energy revenues and $74 million in capacity revenues. Energy revenues increased $292 million at Southern Power primarily from a
$247 million net increase in the price of energy and a $45 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold. Energy revenues increased
$144 million at the traditional electric operating companies primarily due to higher energy prices. The increase in capacity revenues
primarily resulted from a power sales agreement at Alabama Power that began in September 2020 and a net increase in natural gas
PPAs at Southern Power.
Other Electric Revenues
Other electric revenues increased $46 million, or 6.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases
of $28 million in transmission revenues primarily related to new PPAs at Southern Power and increased open access transmission
tariff sales at Alabama Power, $27 million in customer fees largely resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary
suspensions of disconnections and late fees in 2020 for the traditional electric operating companies, $11 million from outdoor
lighting sales at Georgia Power, and $10 million in cogeneration steam revenue associated with higher natural gas prices at
Alabama Power, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in pole attachment revenues at Georgia Power.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2021 and
the percent change from 2020 were as follows:
2021
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted
Percent Change
(in billions)
Residential 47.4 (0.2)% 0.5 %
Commercial 46.7 2.7 3.2 
Industrial 48.7 3.7 3.7 
Other 0.6 (5.1) (5.1)
Total retail 143.4 2.0 2.4 %
Wholesale 50.0 9.5 
Total energy sales 193.4 3.8 %
(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the
estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service
territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of
weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy sales increased 3.4 billion KWHs in 2021 as compared to 2020. Weather-adjusted
residential usage increased primarily due to customer growth, largely offset by decreased customer usage resulting from shelter-in-
place orders in effect during 2020. Weather-adjusted commercial and industrial usage increased primarily due to the negative
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy sales being more severe in 2020.
See "Electric Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price
and KWH sales.
Other Revenues
Other revenues increased $38 million, or 16.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases in
unregulated sales of products and services of $29 million at Alabama Power and $9 million at Georgia Power.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale
market.(*)

Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
In 2021, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 32.4%, as compared to 2020. The
increase was primarily the result of a $1.1 billion increase in the average cost of fuel generated and purchased and a $170 million
increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues
and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses
incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net
income.
Fuel
In 2021, fuel expense was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 35.2%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due
to a 51.2% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 25.7% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by
coal, and a 12.2% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 4.9% decrease in the volume of
KWHs generated by natural gas.
Purchased Power
In 2021, purchased power expense was $978 million, an increase of $179 million, or 22.4%, as compared to 2020. The increase
was primarily due to a 25.8% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas prices.
Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the
market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.
Cost of Other Sales
Cost of other sales increased $15 million, or 16.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in unregulated power
delivery construction and maintenance projects at Georgia Power.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $559 million, or 13.2%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. A portion of the
increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary
economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily associated with increases of $174
million in transmission and distribution expenses, including $37 million of reliability NDR credits applied in 2020 at Alabama(a)

Power, $133 million in scheduled generation outage and maintenance expenses, and $63 million in compensation and benefit
expenses, as well as a $40 million loss on sales-type leases associated with PPAs at Southern Power's Garland and Tranquillity
battery energy storage facilities. Also contributing to the increase was a $19 million increase in compliance and environmental
expenses at the traditional electric operating companies and an $18 million decrease in nuclear property insurance refunds at
Alabama Power and Georgia Power. See Notes 2 and 9 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate NDR" and
"Lessor," respectively, for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $12 million, or 0.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was due to an increase of
$111 million in depreciation associated with additional plant in service, partially offset by a net decrease of $90 million in
amortization of regulatory assets primarily associated with CCR AROs under the terms of Georgia Power's 2019 ARP. See Note 2
to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $38 million, or 3.7%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase primarily reflects a $25
million increase in municipal franchise fees at Georgia Power and a $21 million increase in property taxes primarily resulting from
higher assessed values, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in utility license taxes at Alabama Power.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
Estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 increased $1.4 billion in 2021 as compared to 2020. The losses in each year
were recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional
information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
Gain on dispositions, net increased $17 million, or 40.5%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase primarily reflects $41 million
in gains at Southern Power primarily due to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in the
first quarter 2021 and $14 million in gains at Alabama Power primarily from property sales, partially offset by a $39 million gain at
Southern Power related to the sale of Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Power" for additional information.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $41 million, or 29.7%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase
was primarily associated with Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements
under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $8 million, or 0.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a
decrease of approximately $30 million due to lower interest rates at the traditional electric operating companies and an $11 million
net increase in capitalized interest, partially offset by an increase of approximately $33 million due to an increase in average
outstanding long-term borrowings. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $112 million, or 35.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily related to a $135 million
increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income, partially offset by a $12 million gain recorded by Southern Power
in the third quarter 2020 associated with the Roserock solar facility litigation and an $8 million decrease in interest income. See
Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes decreased $298 million, or 57.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax
earnings primarily resulting from higher charges in 2021 associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at Georgia
Power and changes in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in February
2021 at Southern Power, partially offset by an increase in a valuation allowance on certain state tax credit carryforwards

Substantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling
interests increased $68 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increased loss was primarily due to loss allocations to Southern
Power's partners in the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, including $26 million allocated from the loss on
sales-type leases. In addition, the increased loss was due to higher HLBV loss allocations to Southern Power's wind tax equity
partners, including new partnerships entered into during 2020 and 2021, and lower income allocations to Southern Power's solar
equity partners, totaling $29 million. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power,"
respectively, for additional information.
Gas Business
Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary
businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services (until the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021), and gas marketing
services.
A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows:

Other income (expense), net (53) (94)
Income taxes 275 102 
Net income $ 539 $ (51)
Seasonality of Results
During the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating
Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods
of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services' operating revenues were occasionally impacted due to peak
usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding
cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year.
Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2021, the percentage of
operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through
December) were 70% and 102%, respectively. For 2020, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the
Heating Season were 68% and 86%, respectively.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues in 2021 were $4.4 billion, reflecting a $946 million, or 27.5%, increase compared to 2020. Details of operating
revenues were as follows:
2021
(in millions)
Operating revenues – prior year $ 3,434 
Estimated change resulting from –
Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes 146 
Gas costs and other cost recovery 675 
Wholesale gas services 114 
Other 11 
Operating revenues – current year $ 4,380 
Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to rate increases and continued investment
in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas
cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution
utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption
changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs
recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income
from the natural gas distribution utilities. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2021 primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas sold and higher
commercial activities as a result of Winter Storm Uri, partially offset by derivative losses, all prior to the sale of Sequent. See Note
15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in
Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities charge their
utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory
agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup,
subject to regulatory review. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural
gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to
customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets
and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues
generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.
Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 86.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2021.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost
of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market
value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Cost of natural gas was $1.6 billion, an increase of $647 million, or 66.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020, which reflects higher gas
cost recovery in 2021 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 91.2% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2020.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $106 million, or 11.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility
costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to
continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15
million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly
to customers and have no impact on net income.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
Gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121
million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern
Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
Earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily
due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net decreased $94 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in
charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $102 million, or 59.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to $114 million in
additional tax expense resulting from the sale of Sequent, including changes in state tax apportionment rates, and higher pre-tax
earnings at the natural gas distribution utilities, partially offset by $18 million of tax benefit resulting from the PennEast Pipeline
project impairment charges in the second and third quarters of 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Business Activities
Southern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to
business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial,
industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which
provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public
and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.

Operating Revenues
Southern Company's operating revenues for these other business activities decreased $11 million, or 2.5%, in 2021 as compared to
2020 primarily due to a decrease at Southern Linc related to a contract for the design and construction of a fiber optic system
completed in 2020.
Cost of Other Sales
Cost of other sales for these other business activities increased $15 million, or 6.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to
distributed infrastructure projects at PowerSecure.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses for these other business activities increased $11 million, or 5.6%, in 2021 as compared
to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $16 million increase at the parent company primarily related to director compensation
expenses and an $11 million increase at PowerSecure primarily associated with higher bad debt expense, partially offset by a $17
million decrease at Southern Linc primarily related to the design and construction of a fiber optic system completed in 2020.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
Earnings from equity method investments for these other business activities increased $14 million in 2021 as compared to 2020
primarily due to an increase in investment income at Southern Holdings.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for these other business activities increased $17 million, or 2.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an
increase of approximately $64 million related to higher average outstanding long-term borrowings, partially offset by decreases of
approximately $34 million due to lower interest rates and $6 million due to a reduction in losses associated with the extinguishment
of debt at the parent company. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Impairment of Leveraged Leases
Impairment charges related to leveraged lease investments at Southern Holdings decreased $199 million, or 96.6%, in 2021 as

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net for these other business activities increased $103 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to
a $93 million pre-tax gain ($99 million gain after tax) recorded at Southern Holdings in 2021 related to the termination of leveraged
leases and a $12 million decrease in charitable donations at the parent company. See Note 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company" for additional information.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
The income tax benefit for these other business activities decreased $70 million, or 23.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily
due to the tax impacts related to the 2020 charges associated with leveraged lease investments and the 2021 leveraged lease
dispositions at Southern Holdings, partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings at the parent company. See Notes 9, 10, and 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Leveraged Lease," "Effective Tax Rate," and "Southern Company," respectively, for
additional information.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power's 2021 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $1.24 billion, representing an $88 million, or 7.7%,
increase from 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with an adjustment effective in
January 2021 to Rate RSE, net of a related customer refund, and higher customer usage. Also contributing to the increase were
additional wholesale capacity revenues related to a power sales agreement that began in September 2020 and increased sales of
unregulated products and services. These increases to income were partially offset by increases in operations and maintenance
expenses and depreciation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" for additional information.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues for 2021 were $6.4 billion, reflecting a $583 million, or 10.0%, increase from 2020. Details of operating
revenues were as follows:
2021 2020
(in millions)
Retail — prior year $ 5,213 
Estimated change resulting from —

Affiliates 171 46 
Total wholesale revenues 548 315 
Other operating revenues 366 302 
Total operating revenues $ 6,413 $ 5,830 
Retail revenues increased $286 million, or 5.5%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The significant factors driving this change are
shown in the preceding table. The increase was primarily due to a Rate RSE increase effective January 1, 2021, increases in fuel
and other cost recovery, and increases in commercial and industrial sales primarily due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on energy demand being more severe in 2020. These increases were offset by an increase in the accrual for a Rate RSE
customer refund and milder weather in 2021 when compared to 2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama
Power – Rate RSE" for additional information.
See "Energy Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth and
weather.
Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama
PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and
other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for
additional information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:
2021 2020
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 173 $ 127 
Energy 204 142 
Total non-affiliated $ 377 $ 269 
In 2021, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $108 million, or 40.1%, as compared to 2020 due to a $46
million increase in capacity revenues primarily related to a power sales agreement that began in September 2020 and a $62 million
increase in energy revenues primarily due to higher natural gas prices. See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under
"Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" and "Alabama Power," respectively, for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared
to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company
system's electric service territory, and availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy
revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-
term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce
the energy.
In 2021, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $125 million, or 271.7%, as compared to 2020. The revenue increase
reflects a 110.0% increase in 2021 KWH sales due to higher demand for Alabama Power's available lower cost generation and a
75.8% increase in the price of energy, primarily natural gas.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy
purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.
In 2021, other operating revenues increased $64 million, or 21.2%, as compared to 2020 primarily due to a $29 million increase in
unregulated sales of products and services, a $13 million increase in customer fees largely resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-
related temporary suspensions of disconnections and late fees in 2020, a $10 million increase in cogeneration steam revenue
associated with higher natural gas prices, and an $8 million increase in transmission revenues primarily related to open access
transmission tariff sales.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2021 and
the percent change from 2020 were as follows:
2021
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted
Percent Change(*)
(in billions)
Residential 17.5 (0.9)% (0.7)%
Commercial 12.7 2.3 2.9 
Industrial 20.8 2.2 2.2 
Other 0.1 (13.8) (13.8)

Wholesale
Non-affiliates 9.8 53.8 
Affiliates 5.2 110.0 
Total wholesale 15.0 69.6 
Total energy sales 66.1 11.3 %
(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the
estimated effect of deviations from the normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Alabama Power's
service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence
of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2021 when compared to 2020. In 2021, weather-adjusted
residential KWH sales decreased 0.7% primarily due to safer-at-home guidelines in effect during 2020. Weather-adjusted
commercial KWH sales increased 2.9% and industrial KWH sales increased 2.2% primarily due to the negative impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic on energy sales being more severe in 2020.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and
wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the
availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the
provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $314 million, or 24.4%, compared to 2020. The
increase was primarily due to a $196 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $117 million net
increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC,
continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2
to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate ECR" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense was $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $265 million, or 27.3%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to
a 35.7% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 25.1% increase in the
volume of KWHs generated by coal, and an 8.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 6.7%
decrease in the average cost of nuclear fuel per KWH generated and a 3.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural
gas.
Purchased Power – Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $221 million in 2021, an increase of $30 million, or 15.7%, compared to 2020.
The increase was primarily due to a 19.4% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to a new PPA that began in September
2020 and a 10.6% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas prices.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the
Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the
availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power – Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $147 million in 2021, an increase of $19 million, or 14.8%, compared to 2020. The
increase was primarily due to an 87.4% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas
prices, partially offset by a 38.8% decrease in the volume of KWH purchased as Alabama Power's units generally dispatched at a
lower cost than other available Southern Company system resources.(a)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual
agreements, as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $116 million, or 7.2%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. A portion of the
increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary
economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to a $59 million increase in
generation expenses associated with scheduled outages and Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses primarily related to the
addition of new environmental systems in 2021. Also contributing to the increase were increases of $55 million in transmission and
distribution line maintenance expenses related to reliability NDR credits applied in 2020 and vegetation management expenses, $22
million in compensation and benefit expenses, and $11 million related to unregulated products and services, as well as a $10
million decrease in nuclear property insurance refunds. The increase was partially offset by a $36 million decrease in bad debt
expense and a net decrease of $35 million to the NDR accrual in 2021 when compared to 2020. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Alabama Power – Rate NDR" and " – Rate CNP Compliance" for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $47 million, or 5.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to additional plant in
service, including the purchase of the Central Alabama Generating Station in August 2020. See Notes 5 and 15 to the financial
statements for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $2 million, or 0.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an
increase of approximately $17 million associated with higher average outstanding borrowings, largely offset by a decrease of
approximately $16 million related to lower interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $7 million, or 7.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in non-
service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $35 million, or 10.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 10
to the financial statements for additional information.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's 2021 net income was $584 million, representing a $991 million, or 62.9%, decrease from the previous year. The
decrease was primarily due to a $1.0 billion increase in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Also contributing to the decrease were higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by higher retail revenues
associated with sales growth. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional
information on the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Operating Revenues
Operating revenues for 2021 were $9.3 billion, reflecting a $951 million, or 11.4%, increase from 2020. Details of operating
revenues were as follows:
2021 2020
(in millions)
Retail — prior year $ 7,609

Wholesale revenues 197 115 
Other operating revenues 585 585 
Total operating revenues $ 9,260 $ 8,309 
Retail revenues increased $869 million, or 11.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The significant factors driving this change are
shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to higher contributions from commercial and
industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, fixed residential customer bill programs, the effects of higher KWH sales
on ECCR tariff revenues, and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, partially offset by a decrease in the NCCR
tariff, both effective January 1, 2021. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional
information.
See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales growth in
2021.
Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power
costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Wholesale revenues from power sales were as follows:
2021 2020
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 63 $ 51 
Energy 134 64 
Total $ 197 $ 115 
In 2021, wholesale revenues increased $82 million, or 71.3%, as compared to 2020 largely due to increases of $52 million related
to the average cost of fuel primarily due to higher natural gas prices, $12 million in capacity revenues primarily from shared
Southern Company power pool sales in accordance with the IIC, and $10 million in KWH sales associated with higher market
demand.
Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of
fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the
market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation,
demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company
system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or
decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based
rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions
do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.
Other operating revenues were flat in 2021 compared to 2020. Increases of $33 million in unregulated sales associated with power
delivery construction and maintenance projects and outdoor lighting and $13 million in customer fees, largely resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary suspension of disconnections and late fees in 2020, were largely offset by decreases of $26
million in pole attachment revenues, $9 million associated with the timing of certain unregulated energy conservation projects, and
$5 million from retail solar programs.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2021 and
the percent change from 2020 were as follows:
2021
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted
Percent Change

Other 0.5 (2.3) (2.4)
Total retail 82.9 2.6 3.3 %
Wholesale 3.2 18.1 
Total energy sales 86.1 3.1 %
(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the
estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Georgia Power's service
territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of
weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2021 when compared to 2020. In 2021, weather-adjusted
residential KWH sales increased 1.3% compared to 2020 primarily due to customer growth, partially offset by decreased customer
usage largely due to shelter-in-place orders in effect during 2020. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 3.4% and(*)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased 5.7% primarily due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
energy sales being more severe in 2020.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated
companies.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
Fuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is
determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia
Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.
Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:
2021 2020
Total generation (in billions of KWHs) 58.1 56.8 
Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs) 31.7 30.5 
Sources of generation (percent) —

Nuclear 28 27 
Coal 20 16 
Hydro and other 4 5 
Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)  —
Gas 3.05 2.19 
Nuclear 0.79 0.80

Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) 2.39 1.96 
Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH) 5.07 3.69 
(*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.9 billion in 2021, an increase of $750 million, or 34.2%, compared to 2020. The
increase was due to an increase of $651 million related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an increase of $99
million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally
offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense was $1.4 billion in 2021, an increase of $308 million, or 27.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to
a 39.3% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated and a 27.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by
coal, partially offset by a 7.4% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated and a decrease of 5.2% in the volume of
KWHs generated by natural gas.
Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $632 million in 2021, an increase of $92 million, or 17.0%, compared to 2020.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of 23.4% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas
prices, partially offset by a decrease of 3.5% in the volume of KWHs purchased as Georgia Power units and Southern Company
system resources generally dispatched at a lower cost than available market resources.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the
Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and
the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.(*)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Purchased Power - Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $859 million in 2021, an increase of $350 million, or 68.8%, compared to 2020. The
increase was primarily due to an increase of 53.4% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas
prices and an increase of 8.4% in the volume of KWHs purchased due to lower cost Southern Company system resources as
compared to available Georgia Power-owned generation and market resources.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual
agreements, all as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $260 million, or 13.3%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. A portion of the
increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary
economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to increases of $104 million in
transmission and distribution expenses associated with vegetation and asset management activities, $63 million in generation
expenses associated with outage and non-outage maintenance costs and environmental projects, $28 million in certain
compensation and benefit expenses, and $8 million in maintenance costs at corporate and field support facilities, as well as an $8
million decrease in nuclear property insurance refunds.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased $54 million, or 3.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an $88 million
decrease in amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs under the terms of the 2019 ARP, partially offset by a $39
million increase in depreciation associated with additional plant in service. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia
Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $32 million, or 7.2%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a $25 million increase
in municipal franchise fees largely related to higher retail revenues and a $9 million increase in property taxes primarily resulting
from an increase in the assessed value of property.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
Estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 increased $1.4 billion in 2021 as compared to 2020. The losses in each year
were recorded to reflect revisions to the total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $36 million, or 39.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due
to a higher AFUDC base largely associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $4 million, or 0.9%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an
increase of $16 million in amounts capitalized largely associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, partially offset
by an $11 million increase in interest expense primarily associated with higher average outstanding borrowings. See FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for
additional information on borrowings and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for
additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $53 million, or 59.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a $50 million increase
in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on
Georgia Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.

Income Taxes (Benefit)
In 2021, income tax benefit was $168 million compared to income tax expense of $152 million for 2020, a change of $320 million.
The change was primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings resulting from higher charges in 2021 associated with the construction of
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, partially offset by an increase in a valuation allowance on certain state tax credit carryforwards. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" and Note 10 to the financial statements for
additional information.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's net income was $159 million in 2021 compared to $152 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to
revenues resulting from an increase in base rates that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2021 and higher customer
usage, as well as an increase in other income (expense), net, partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses.

statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.
See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.
Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy
component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy
component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power
expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi
Power's service territory. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional
information.
Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically,
these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be
followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-
affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's
variable cost to produce the energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $77 million, or 69.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily
due to an $86 million increase associated with higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a $10 million decrease associated with
lower KWH sales.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $496 million in 2021, an increase of $124 million, or 33.3%, as compared to 2020. The
increase was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of natural gas.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" and Note 1 to the financial statements under "Fuel Costs" for additional information.
Fuel expense increased $120 million, or 34.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a 44.7% increase in the average cost of
natural gas per KWH generated, partially offset by a 4.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.
Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $29 million, or 10.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. A portion of the increase
in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy
resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to increases of $7 million associated with
the Kemper County energy facility (primarily related to increases in dismantlement activities and less salvage proceeds in 2021), $7
million in generation expenses associated with outage and non-outage maintenance, $6 million in distribution operations and
maintenance, and $6 million in compensation and benefit expenses.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $18 million, or 105.9%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9
million decrease in charitable donations and increases of $6 million in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and $3
million in interest associated with a sales-type lease. See Notes 9 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $7 million, or 50.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher pre-tax earnings and an increase associated
with lower flowback of excess deferred income taxes associated with new PEP rates that became effective for the first billing cycle
of April 2021. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan" and Note 10 to the

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Southern Power
Net income attributable to Southern Power for 2021 was $266 million, a $28 million increase from 2020. The increase was
primarily due to a net increase in revenues associated with new PPAs and a tax benefit due to changes in state apportionment
methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in February 2021, partially offset by an increase in
other operations and maintenance expenses primarily associated with scheduled outages and maintenance and a gain recorded in

Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural
gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not
contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of
the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.
Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue
Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed
costs plus a return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the
energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy
compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start
charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied
by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.
Solar and Wind Energy Revenue
Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have
capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a
fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to
recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these
facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

Total operating revenues $ 2,216 $ 1,733 
Operating revenues for 2021 were $2.2 billion, a $483 million, or 28% increase from 2020. The increase in operating revenues was
primarily due to the following:
•PPA capacity revenues increased $24 million, or 6%, primarily due to a net increase in sales associated with new natural gas
PPAs and increased capacity sales under existing natural gas PPAs.
•PPA energy revenues increased $292 million, or 29%, primarily due to an increase in sales under existing natural gas PPAs
resulting from a $206 million increase in the price of fuel and purchased power and a $79 million net increase in sales
associated with new natural gas PPAs. Also contributing to the increase was $15 million related to new wind PPAs which began
during 2020 and 2021, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in sales under existing wind PPAs.
•Non-PPA revenues increased $151 million, or 48%, due to a $197 million increase in the market price of energy, partially offset
by a $46 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales.
•Other revenues increased $16 million, or 114%, primarily due to transmission revenues related to new PPAs.

Total generation and purchased power 47 —% 47
Total generation and purchased power (excluding solar , wind, fuel cells, and tolling agreements) 28 —% 28
Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel
(tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under
such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues
and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are
not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power
pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.
Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the
Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on
an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate
company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Details of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows:
2021 2020
(in millions)
Fuel $ 802 $ 470 
Purchased power 139 74 
Total fuel and purchased power expenses $ 941 $ 544 
In 2021, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $397 million, or 73%, compared to 2020. Fuel expense increased $332
million, or 71%, primarily due to an increase in the average cost of fuel. Purchased power expense increased $65 million, or 88%,
due to an increase associated with the average cost of purchased power.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $70 million, or 20%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily
due to increases of $21 million in scheduled outage and maintenance expenses, $15 million in transmission expenses primarily
related to new PPAs, $10 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $8 million in expenses associated with new wind facilities
placed in service during 2020 and 2021, and $5 million related to the allocation of uncollected settlements by the Energy Reliability
Council of Texas market as a result of Winter Storm Uri.
Depreciation and Amortization
In 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 5%, compared to 2020 primarily due to new wind facilities placed
in service during 2020 and 2021.
Loss on Sales-Type Leases
In 2021, a $40 million loss on sales-type leases was recorded upon commencement of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy
storage facilities' PPAs, $26 million of which was allocated through noncontrolling interests to Southern Power's partners in the
projects. The loss was due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners. See Notes 9 and 15 to
the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $2 million, or 5%, compared to 2020. Gains on dispositions totaled $41 million in 2021
primarily due to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in the first quarter 2021. A $39
million gain was also recorded in the first quarter 2020 related to the sale of Plant Mankato. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Power" and "Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants," respectively, for additional
information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
In 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $9 million, or 47%, compared to 2020 primarily due to a $12 million gain recorded
in the third quarter 2020 associated with the Roserock solar facility litigation.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
In 2021, income tax benefit was $13 million compared to income tax expense of $3 million for 2020, a change of $16 million. The
change was primarily due to changes in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of
Alabama in February 2021 and the tax impact from the sale of Plant Mankato in January 2020. See Notes 1, 10, and 15 to the
financial statements under "Income Taxes," "Effective Tax Rate," and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
In 2021, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $68 million compared to 2020. The increased loss was primarily
due to loss allocations to the partners in the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, including $26 million
allocated from the loss on sales-type leases. In addition, the increased loss was due to higher HLBV loss allocations to wind tax
equity partners, including new partnerships entered into during 2020 and 2021, and lower income allocations to solar equity
partners, totaling $29 million. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively,
for additional information.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Southern Company Gas
Operating Metrics
Southern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and
volumes of natural gas sold.
Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating
Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has
various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its
exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also
utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.
The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices,
economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are
primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.
Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects
of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural
gas volumes sold to its customers.
Seasonality of Results
During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the
gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021,
wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to
summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and
certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of
certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable.
However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas'
operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.
Percent Generated During
Heating Season
Operating RevenuesNet
Income
2021 70 % 102 %
2020 68 % 86 %
Net Income
Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2021 was $539 million, a decrease of $51 million, or 8.6%, compared to
2020. The decrease was primarily due to $85 million of deferred income taxes and an $80 million decrease at gas pipeline
investments primarily due to impairment charges related to the PennEast Pipeline project, partially offset by a $93 million increase
at wholesale gas services primarily due to the gain on the sale of Sequent and a $22 million increase at gas distribution operations
primarily due to base rate increases and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 7 to the financial statements
under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information on the PennEast Pipeline project and Note 15 to the financial statements
under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information on the sale of Sequent.

Operating revenues – current year $ 4,380 
Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2021 due to rate increases and continued investment in infrastructure
replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a
result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather
or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas
distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through
natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution
operations. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2021 primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas sold and higher
commercial activities as a result of Winter Storm Uri, partially offset by derivative losses, all prior to the sale of Sequent. See
"Segment Information – Wholesale Gas Services" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas"
for additional information.
Heating Degree Days
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that limit their exposure to weather
changes. Southern Company Gas also uses hedges for any remaining exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas

(*)Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. December 31, 2020 also includes approximately 50,000 customers in Ohio
contracted through an annual auction process to serve for 12 months beginning April 1, 2020.
Southern Company Gas anticipates customer growth and uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers
and to retain existing customers.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility
customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies.
Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to
regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount
of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers
prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued
natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal
the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas
distribution operations represented 86.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2021.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost
of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market
value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
In 2021, cost of natural gas was $1.6 billion, an increase of $647 million, or 66.6%, compared to 2020, which reflects higher gas
cost recovery in 2021 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 91.2% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2020.(*)

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $106 million, or 11.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility
costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.
Depreciation and Amortization
In 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to
continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
In 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15
million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly
to customers and have no impact on net income.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121
million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern
Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
In 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily

Gas Distribution Operations
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight
by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern
Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed
and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a
reasonable return on its investments.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas
market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the
earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather
conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas
consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization
mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather
changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories.
In 2021, net income increased $22 million, or 5.6%, compared to 2020. Operating revenues increased $727 million primarily due to
higher gas cost recovery, rate increases, and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. Gas costs recovered through
natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses increased $674 million
primarily due to a $540 million increase in cost of gas as a result of higher natural gas prices and higher volumes sold, largely as a
result of colder weather in the first quarter 2021 compared to 2020, higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in
service, higher taxes other than income taxes due to higher pass through taxes, and higher compensation expenses. Other income
and expense decreased $10 million primarily due to a decrease in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. Interest
expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $15 million primarily due to additional debt issued to finance continued investments.
Income taxes increased $6 million primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings" and " – Infrastructure Replacement
Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information. Also see Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information
on retirement benefits.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Gas Pipeline Investments
Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, PennEast Pipeline,
Dalton Pipeline, and Atlantic Coast Pipeline (until its sale on March 24, 2020). In 2021, net income decreased $80 million, or
80.8%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax)
related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information
regarding the September 2021 cancellation of the PennEast Pipeline project.
Wholesale Gas Services
Prior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services was involved in asset management and optimization, storage, transportation,
producer and peaking services, natural gas supply, natural gas services, and wholesale gas marketing. Southern Company Gas
positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings on an annual basis even under low volatility market conditions that
can result from a number of factors. When market price volatility increased, wholesale gas services was positioned to capture
significant value and generate stronger results. Operating expenses primarily reflected employee compensation and benefits. See
Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.
In 2021, net income increased $93 million compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $114 million increase in
operating revenues due to higher commercial activity driven by natural gas price volatility that was generated by cold weather,
partially offset by unfavorable storage and transportation derivatives due to widening transportation spreads, as well as a $121
million gain on the sale of Sequent, partially offset by a $14 million increase in other operating expenses primarily related to an
increase in variable compensation, a $101 million decrease in other income and (expense) related to higher charitable contributions,
and a $29 million increase in income tax expense due to higher pre-tax earnings.
Gas Marketing Services
Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice
programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas
supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is
weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools,
to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.
In 2021, net income decreased $1 million, or 1.1%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in operating
expenses primarily related to a $73 million increase in the cost of gas in 2021 resulting from higher natural gas prices, largely offset
by a $67 million increase in operating revenues due to higher natural gas prices and increased retail price spreads.
All Other
All other includes natural gas storage businesses, including Jefferson Island through its sale on December 1, 2020, fuels operations
through the sale of Southern Company Gas' interest in Pivotal LNG on March 24, 2020, AGL Services Company, and Southern
Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest
income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements.
In 2021, net loss increased $85 million compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to additional tax expense due to changes
in state apportionment rates as a result of the sale of Sequent. See Note 10 to the financial statements and Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
General
Prices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distributed by the natural gas
distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based
regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and may be
adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and
appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the traditional
electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale electricity sales,
interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to
focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility
Regulation" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities
described in Note 15 to the financial statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants'
future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary
businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.
For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments
that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected
long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel,
restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding
and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trend of reduced electricity usage per
customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 and the related cost recovery proceedings is another major factor.
Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the
adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce
transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.
Global and U.S. economic conditions have been significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that caused a global
and national economic recession in 2020. Most prominently, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted global supply
chains and business operations as suppliers continue to experience difficulties keeping up with strong demand for factory goods,
which is being driven by low business inventories. In addition, rising inflation in 2021 and 2022 has resulted in increasing costs for
many goods and services. The combination of rising inoculation rates in the U.S. population and the federal COVID-19 relief
package contributed to increased economic recovery in 2021; however, fiscal support of business and personal incomes is
declining. The drivers, speed, and depth of the 2020 economic contraction were unprecedented and have reduced energy demand
across the Southern Company system's service territory, primarily in the commercial and industrial classes. Retail electric revenues
attributable to changes in sales increased in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily due to the normalization of economic activity;
however, retail electric sales continued to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to pre-pandemic
trends. Recovery is expected to continue in 2022, but the impacts of new COVID-19 variants, as well as responses to the COVID-
19 pandemic by both customers and governments, could significantly affect the pace of recovery. The ultimate extent of the
negative impact on revenues depends on the depth and duration of the economic contraction in the Southern Company system's
service territory and cannot be determined at this time. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on COVID-19-
related impacts on energy demand in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2021.
The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including
the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to
execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while
containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's
market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards;
availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of
generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and operational limitations. See "Income Tax Matters" herein,
Note 10 to the financial statements, and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary
businesses in the gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include
the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of
prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resilience,
natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and
subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; certain city-wide bans
on the use of natural gas in new construction; and Southern Company Gas' ability to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices.
The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position
against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from
locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies and diminished
gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. Additional economic factors may
contribute to this environment. If current economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which
may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a
significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas
production.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather,
competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale
customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, government incentives
to reduce overall energy usage, the prices of electricity and natural gas, and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity
and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be
affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC.
The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 14.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021 and are
generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any
changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide
array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving
other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal
restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from
competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may
significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and
Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of
businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
Environmental Matters
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and
regulations governing air, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern
Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and upcoming
requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised environmental laws
and regulations could further affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required to comply with
environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs,
and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are
subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows,
and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and
monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the
Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is
expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate
impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will
depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed
technology, fuel prices, the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges, and the ability to continue recovering the related
costs, through rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term
wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.
Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP
Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of
environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental
remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a
result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and
renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than
for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns,
including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the
availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about
potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future facility. The impact of
such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be
determined at this time.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural
gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and
industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which may have the potential to
affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.
Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or
modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital
expenditures through 2026 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the
traditional electric operating companies are as follows:
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Total
(in millions)
Southern Company $ 98 $ 111 $ 146 $ 72 $ 58 $ 485 
Alabama Power 49 35 50 33 28 195 
Georgia Power 37 75 91 34 25 262 
Mississippi Power 12 1 5 5 5 28 
These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See "Global Climate Issues"
herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond
closure and groundwater monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants'
ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements" herein and Note 6 to the financial
statements for additional information.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Air Quality
The Southern Company system reduced SO and NO air emissions by 99% and 93%, respectively, from 1990 to 2020. The
Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by 98% from 2005 to 2020.
The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states and various federal agencies to
develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of
restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States were required to submit
state implementation plans for the second 10-year planning period (2018 through 2028) by July 31, 2021; however, plans have not
yet been submitted by the applicable states in the Southern Company system's service territory. These plans could require further
reductions in particulate matter, SO, and/or NO, which could result in increased compliance costs at affected electric generating
units.
Water Quality
In 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake
structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants. The regulation requires plant-
specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms. The results of these plant-specific studies, which are
ongoing within the Southern Company system, are being submitted with each plant's next National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit cycle. The Southern Company system anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly
CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. The impact of this rule will
depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each
plant's NPDES permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.
In October 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (ELG Reconsideration Rule), a
reconsideration of the 2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extends
the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The ELG Reconsideration Rule also updates the voluntary
incentive program and provides new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will
permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. As required by the ELG Reconsideration Rule, on October 13, 2021, Alabama Power
and Georgia Power each submitted initial notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these
subcategories.
Alabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire
Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (3502 X

MWs) and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1
through 4 (1,000 MWs). These plans are expected to be completed on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. The
NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. Retirement of Plant Barry Unit 5 could occur as early as 2023, subject to
completion of the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station and certain operating conditions. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial
statements under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" and "SEGCO," respectively, for additional
information.
The assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net
book values totaling approximately $1.5 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate
CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2021. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory
asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs,
associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the Environmental
Accounting Order, the regulatory asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful life, as
established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements
under "Alabama Power – Rate CNP Compliance" and " – Environmental Accounting Order" for additional information.
Georgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant
Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3
(614 MWs based on 75% ownership) on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to pursue
compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership) through the
voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to comply with the ELG Rules for Plant
Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025; therefore, no NOPP submission was
required for these units. The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are subject to the review of the Georgia EPD.
The units for which Georgia Power has indicated early retirement plans have net book values totaling approximately $2.2 billion
(excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through the ECCR tariff) at December 31, 2021. A final decision
regarding the future operation of Georgia Power's impacted units and the timing of any retirements are subject to review by the
Georgia PSC as a part of Georgia Power's 2022 IRP proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power –
Integrated Resource Plan" for additional information.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
The ELG Reconsideration Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs for the traditional
electric operating companies and SEGCO. However, the ultimate impact of the ELG Reconsideration Rule will depend on the
Southern Company system's final assessment of compliance options, the incorporation of these assessments into each of the
traditional electric operating company's IRP process, the incorporation of these new requirements into each plant's NPDES permit,
and the outcome of legal challenges. The ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations
and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while
the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule is expected in the fall of 2022. Any
revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance strategies.
Coal Combustion Residuals
In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and
gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires
landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met.
Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with
the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the
management and disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the
EPA for its state CCR permitting program. The State of Mississippi has not developed a state CCR permit program.
The Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in August 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR
wastes to unlined surface impoundments to April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the
deadline. The traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments
prior to April 11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. On January 11, 2022, the EPA proposed
determinations on deadline extension requests for other non-affiliated facilities, which reflected its positions on a variety of CCR
Rule compliance requirements including closure standards, groundwater monitoring, and corrective action. The traditional electric
operating companies are in the process of reviewing these determinations to determine how the EPA's current positions may

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
impact their closure plans and groundwater monitoring efforts. The ultimate impact of the EPA's announced positions on the
traditional electric operating companies cannot be determined at this time, but may be material.
Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules,
the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related
cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to closure methodologies, schedules, and/or
costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs
and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued
recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and
the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
"Cash Requirements," Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans," and Note 6 to the financial
statements for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of
waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur
substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies
to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their
financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional
electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of
Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable
state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory
mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory
agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup
costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental
Remediation" for additional information.
Global Climate Issues
In 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule), which would have required states to develop unit-
specific CO emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. On January 19, 2021,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE Rule back to the EPA. On October
29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted four petitions for writs of certiorari asking the court to review the District of Columbia
Circuit's decision. The U.S. Supreme Court's review will focus on the extent of the EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions
from the power sector under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.
On February 19, 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding
universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in
place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years. On April 22, 2021 President Biden announced a new target
for the United States to achieve a 50% to 52% reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The target
was accepted by the United Nations as the United States' nationally determined emissions reduction contribution under the Paris
Agreement.
Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG
emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an
electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 22% coal and 48% natural gas in 2021. This transition
has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 5,600 MWs of coal-fired generating capacity since 2010
and converting over 3,400 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015, as well as constructing and/or acquiring
over 11,000 MWs of renewable resource capacity since 2010. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations – Water Quality" herein
for information on plans to retire or convert to natural gas additional coal-fired generating capacity. In addition, Southern Company
Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe),
resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3 million metric tons of CO equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.2

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
The following table provides the Registrants' 2020 and preliminary 2021 GHG emissions based on equity share of facilities:
2020 Preliminary 2021
(in million metric tons of CO equivalent)

Southern Company Gas 1 1
(*)Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the
applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007
levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2021 emissions, the Southern
Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 47% since 2007. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic
resulted in reduced electricity usage by customers, which led to a higher than expected decline in GHG emissions. In 2021,
increased customer demand combined with increased utilization of the coal generating fleet due to higher natural gas prices resulted
in an increase in GHG emissions from 2020 levels. Southern Company system management expects to achieve sustained GHG
emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025. Southern Company system management, working with applicable regulators,
plans to transition its generating fleet in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders.
Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and
deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management plans
to continue to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue
to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and make the necessary related investments in transmission and
distribution systems; continue its research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions,
including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage with policymakers, regulators, investors,
customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.
Regulatory Matters
See OVERVIEW – "Recent Developments" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters
related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the
applicable registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
Construction Programs
The Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads
on their respective systems. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new
electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems,
and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.
For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to
be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for information
regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.
See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's
construction of renewable energy facilities.
Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas
distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The
natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their
regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and
Capital Projects" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.2

See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information regarding the
Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.
Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements
General
Southern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs,
municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide
Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.
Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable
substitute guarantee if (i) S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating,
(ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.
Southern Power is working to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale markets. During 2021, Southern Power continued to
be successful in remarketing up to 2,025 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several
PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase
contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.
Natural Gas
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of
agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a
portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or
block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power
serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from
Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the
requirements customers' resources when economically viable.
As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling
agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy
delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated
in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern
Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating
facility.
Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs
based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs,
Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Long-Term Service Agreements" for additional
information.
Solar and Wind
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however,
these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable
facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result,
Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy
generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints,
and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the
renewable energy credits.
Income Tax Matters
Consolidated Income Taxes
The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to
utilize certain tax credits. See "Tax Credits" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Accounting for Income Taxes" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Tax Credits
The Tax Reform Legislation, as modified by the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law in December 2020, retained
solar energy incentives as described in the following table:
ITC Percentage Date Project Commenced Construction
30% Prior to December 31, 2019
26% From 2020 through 2022
22% During 2023
A permanent 10% ITC will remain for projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2024 and any projects placed in
service after December 31, 2025, regardless of when construction began.
In addition, various tax legislation has retained or extended wind energy incentives as described in the following table:
PTC Percentage Year Project Commenced Construction
100% 2016
80% 2017
60% 2018
40% 2019
60% 2020 or 2021
0% 2022 and after
Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell facilities, and battery
energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.
Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing
solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind
facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At
December 31, 2021, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.2 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of
unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2024, but could be further delayed. Since
2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax
partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern
Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the
financial statements under "Income Taxes" and Note 10 to the financial statements under "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax
Credit Carryforwards" and "Effective Tax Rate" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the
tax benefit related to associated basis differences.
General Litigation and Other Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings,
cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any
subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not
specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate
liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial
statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being
litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the
notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein).
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the
II-47

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with
the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.
Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their
respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory
agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge
customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate
regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than
when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of
liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities
also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These
estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution
utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants
than they would on a non-regulated company.
Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2021 for the applicable Registrants
were as follows: 88% for Southern Company, 98% for Alabama Power, 96% for Georgia Power, 99.7% for Mississippi Power, and
84% for Southern Company Gas.
As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management
reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on
applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact
the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable
Registrants.
Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
(Southern Company and Georgia Power)
In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection
with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which
included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project
manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement
Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3
billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement
was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be
disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be
reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of
proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3
billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer
refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur
subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4. In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions
upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to
reconsider the decision to continue construction.
As of December 31, 2021, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to $10.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received
under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes
construction contingency of $150 million and is based on projected in-service dates at the end of the first quarter 2023 and the
fourth quarter 2023 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. Since 2018, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling
$2.2 billion have been assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are
reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically
states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery for
the $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia
Power in the second quarter 2018 and has not sought rate recovery for the construction contingency costs. After considering the
significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these
II-48

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory
proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter
2018; $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176 million ($131 million after tax) in the second quarter and the fourth quarter
2020, respectively; and $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax), $264 million ($197 million after
tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax) in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the
fourth quarter 2021, respectively.
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases
subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts") or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the
calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion
and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other Vogtle Owners have asserted that
the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global
Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440
million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project
capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately
$460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated
with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle
Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a
decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February
14, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts" for
additional information on the Global Amendments.
As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to
incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers
and related test results, and workforce statistics. Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and
Unit 4.
As Unit 3 completes system turnover from construction and moves to testing and transition to operations, ongoing and potential
future challenges include completion of construction remediation work, completion of work packages, including inspection records,
and other documentation necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load, and final component and pre-operational
tests. As Unit 4 progresses through construction and continues to transition into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges
include the pace and quality of electrical installation, availability of craft and supervisory resources, including the temporary
diversion of such resources to support Unit 3 construction efforts, and the pace of work package closures and system turnovers. As
construction, including subcontract work, continues on both Units 3 and 4, ongoing or future challenges include management of
contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the
installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or
related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into
initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or
components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global
nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and
estimated cost. In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and
testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal
and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the
requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses,
including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. Findings resulting from such
inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests
have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters,
including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and
approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, have arisen or may arise, which may result in
additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance
issues, including inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that
could result in increased costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the
first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4, including the current level of cost sharing described in Note
II-49
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million
per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs.
While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the
amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will
ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be
recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.
Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of
any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and
Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia
Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and
valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data,
reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the
statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.
Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of
which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to
that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined
level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of
these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of
Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available
information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.
Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income
to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the
apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies
that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner
inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for
all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.
Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company
Gas)
AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of
future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the
timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future
removal activities.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule
and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations
related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as
obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term
assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these
assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is
indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these
retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the
ARO.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure
and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the
CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue
periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these
assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial
statements for additional information, including increases to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2021 by certain
Registrants.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be
critical accounting estimates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and
Southern Company Gas)
The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of
assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan
assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement
benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are
accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in
future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.
Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the
discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of
determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company
discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of
market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The
discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the
projected benefit obligations.
The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, as described
in Note 11 to the financial statements, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents
the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments.
Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the
LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs
component of net periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.

Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)
The acquisition method of accounting requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at
their respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a
residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on
an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur,
including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a
planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level
below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management.
Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.
As part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is
more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative
goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and
circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial
performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative
assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its
carrying value.
Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.
For its 2021 annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas performed the quantitative assessment and confirmed that the
II-52
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. For its 2020 and 2019 annual impairment tests,
Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of
all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative assessment was required. For
its annual impairment tests for PowerSecure, Southern Company performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair
value of goodwill at PowerSecure exceeding its carrying value in all years presented. However, Southern Company recorded
goodwill impairment charges totaling $34 million in 2019 as a result of its decision to sell certain PowerSecure business units. See
Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company" for additional information. The COVID-19 pandemic and the
related impacts on the worldwide economy have disrupted supply chains, reduced labor availability and productivity, and reduced
economic activity in the United States. These effects have had a variety of adverse impacts on Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including PowerSecure. If these factors continue to negatively affect the operating results of PowerSecure and its
businesses, a portion of the associated goodwill of $263 million may become impaired. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
be determined at this time.
The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as
well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are
determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset,
and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain
estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be
recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities" for additional information
regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.
Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the
asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual
disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is
determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. In addition,
when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets or asset
group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these
evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years. Impairments
of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory
disallowances.
Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities,
Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets, whether
in service or under construction.
For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period
losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to
remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract, or the inability of a
customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include,
but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses
combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew
or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability
to deploy a development project.
As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves
management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an
impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
During 2021 and 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling $7 million ($6 million after tax) and $206 million
($105 million after tax), respectively, related to its leveraged lease investments. During 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded
total pre-tax charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project.
During 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $91 million ($69 million after-tax) related to a
natural gas storage facility and approximately $24 million ($17 million after tax) related to the sale of Pivotal LNG. See Notes 7
and 9 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Leveraged Lease," respectively, and
Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent asset impairments.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Revenue Recognition (Southern Power)
Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-
derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges.
Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification,
which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern
Power are described further below.
Lease Transactions
Southern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or
contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in
exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine
whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, Southern Power's power sales contracts that are
determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are
recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. For those contracts that are determined to be sales-type
leases, capacity revenues are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment in the lease and are included in
Southern Power's operating revenues. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.
Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative Transactions
If the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of
a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a
normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment,
including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating
capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.
Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts.
For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues
related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to
the financial statements for additional information.
Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)
Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power
will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, the
purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the
definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on
the relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may
engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions,
and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts,
discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for
potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional
information on recent acquisitions.
Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)
Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern
Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to
the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.
If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of
operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in
membership interests.
Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing
arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these
arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV
method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the
end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.
Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)
The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that
subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the
financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their
exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus,
the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the
Registrants.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for
reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The
amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions
that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses
under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging
relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities
classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments
prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the
amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.
The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at
Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these
agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no
material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to continue,
the Registrants will continue to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2020–04 and the impacts of transitioning to an alternative rate, and
the ultimate outcome of the transition cannot be determined at this time. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
"Overview" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements under "Interest Rate Derivatives" for
additional information.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Overview
The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2021. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily
consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital
expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital
expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to build new
generation facilities to meet projected long-term demand requirements and to replace units being retired as part of the generation
fleet transition, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental
modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution
facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may
include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's
performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected
long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these
systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information.
Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2021, Southern Power utilized tax credits,
which provided $288 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2022 through 2024, each Registrant's

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
projected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities, as well as distributions to noncontrolling interests for Southern
Power, are expected to exceed its operating cash flows. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its
operating cash flows through one or more of the following: accessing borrowings from financial institutions, issuing debt and
hybrid securities in the capital markets, and/or through its stock plans. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its future cash
needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions,
and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions.
The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital
needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to
meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information.
To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), the Registrants have established an initiative to
assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark
rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated and implemented. Substantially all of the Registrants' credit facilities allow for
LIBOR to be phased out and replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR
transition through the adoption of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and subsequent amendments. None of the Registrants
expects the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact.
The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their
nuclear decommissioning trust funds increased in value at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. No
contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2021 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans
are anticipated during 2022. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" and "Pension Plans,"
respectively, for additional information.
At the end of 2021, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $68.58 per share (based on the closing price as
reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $26.30 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 261%, compared to
$61.43, $26.48, and 232%, respectively, at the end of 2020.
Cash Requirements
Capital Expenditures
Total estimated capital expenditures, including LTSA and nuclear fuel commitments, for the Registrants through 2026 based on
their current construction programs are as follows:
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
(in billions)

financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
(b)Includes expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $0.9 billion for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
(c)Excludes approximately $0.3 billion in 2022, $0.5 billion in 2023, and $0.8 billion per year for 2024 through 2026 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions
and placeholder growth, which may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.
These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential
compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and
landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO
liabilities. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost
estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others.
These anticipated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are
refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2026 are provided in the table below. Material
expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power
and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the
financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and
Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein.

Georgia Power 317 307 368 489 555 
Mississippi Power 16 20 23 30 16 
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in
environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating
plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to
meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected
environmental compliance program; changes in legislation and/or regulation; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction
labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or
regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impair the
ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance
that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern
Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and
construction projects.
The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new
technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be
subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction
expenditures.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Construction Programs" herein for additional information.
Other Significant Cash Requirements
Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the
Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2021,
the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the
next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Fuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Commitments" for information on
Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and
purchased power commitments at December 31, 2021 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs
include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions
for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on
various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at
December 31, 2021. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the
applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2022 through 2026. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2021
that extend beyond 2026 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for
various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the
financial statements.

Georgia Power's 2022 IRP filing included a request for six PPAs, which are expected to be accounted for as leases, that are
contingent upon approval by the Georgia PSC. Five of the six PPAs are with Southern Power and are also contingent upon approval
by the FERC. The expected capacity payments associated with the PPAs total $6 million in 2024, $79 million in 2025, $86 million
in 2026, and $908 million thereafter, of which $5 million in 2024, $68 million in 2025, $75 million in 2026, and $748 million
thereafter relate to the affiliate PPAs with Southern Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power –

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Sources of Capital
Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings from financial institutions,
and debt and equity issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private
placements, or public offerings. Southern Company does not expect to issue any equity in the capital markets through 2026 but may
issue equity through its stock plans during this time. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Equity Units" for information on
stock purchase contracts associated with Southern Company's equity units.
The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the
past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and
equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as
discussed further herein).
The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2022, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment
opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals
(for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information.
Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the
federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for
using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2021, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for
the Deuel Harvest wind facility, the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, and existing tax equity partnerships
totaling $299 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under "General" and "Southern Power," respectively, for
additional information.
The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the
applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term
securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public
offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its
subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration
statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the
appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate
filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.
The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial
statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a
centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the
Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.
The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are
loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these
arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial
paper program.
Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas,
which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper
programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital
needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries
benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to
affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2021, the amount of subsidiary retained
earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.3 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash
obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently
anticipated cash obligations.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic
use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan
to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see "Financing
Activities" herein for information on financing activities that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2021. The following table

The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as
commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances,
the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.

Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b)Includes $1.047 billion and $700 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.
Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit
arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the
maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of the unused credit with banks is
allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper
programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric
operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2021 was approximately $1.5 billion (comprised of
approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $672 million at Georgia Power, and $34 million at Mississippi Power). In addition,
at December 31, 2021, Georgia Power had approximately $157 million of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to
be remarketed within the next 12 months. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional

Financing activities (576) 16 676 (222) (1,372) 180 
Fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of
securities.
Southern Company
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $0.5 billion in 2021 as compared to 2020 largely due to decreased fuel cost
recovery at the traditional electric operating companies and under recovered natural gas costs at the natural gas distribution utilities,
partially offset by customer bill credits issued in 2020 at Georgia Power and the timing of customer receivable collections.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to the Subsidiary Registrants' construction
programs.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term and short-term debt,
partially offset by common stock dividend payments. The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to
common stock dividend payments and net repayments of short-term bank debt and commercial paper, partially offset by net
issuances of long-term debt and issuances of common stock.
Alabama Power
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $311 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in
retail revenues associated with a Rate RSE adjustment effective in January 2021 and higher customer usage, as well as the timing
of fossil fuel stock purchases and receivable collections, partially offset by decreased fuel cost recovery.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to capital contributions from Southern
Company and net long-term debt issuances, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.
Georgia Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $37 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to decreased fuel cost
recovery, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections and vendor payments and customer bill credits issued in
2020 associated with Tax Reform and 2018 and 2019 earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions, including
approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information on construction of Plant Vogtle

contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by debt redemptions, common stock dividend payments, and a decrease in
commercial paper borrowings. The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to debt repayments and
redemptions and a return of capital and common stock dividends paid to Southern Company, partially offset by debt issuances and
capital contributions from Southern Company.
Southern Power
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $50 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the timing of
vendor payments.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2021 was primarily related to the acquisition of the Deuel Harvest wind facility and
ongoing construction activities. The net cash provided from investing activities in 2020 was primarily related to proceeds from the
disposition of Plant Mankato, partially offset by ongoing construction activities and the acquisition of the Beech Ridge II wind
facility. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
The net cash used for financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to a return of capital to Southern Company and common
stock dividend payments, partially offset by net capital contributions from noncontrolling interests and net issuances of senior
notes. The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to the repayment of senior notes at maturity, common
stock dividend payments, and net repayments of short-term bank debt and commercial paper, partially offset by net contributions
from noncontrolling interests.
Southern Company Gas
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $544 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to natural gas cost
under recovery, reflecting an increase in the cost of gas purchased during Winter Storm Uri, as well as the timing of vendor
payments.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to construction of transportation and distribution
assets recovered through base rates and infrastructure investment recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution
operations, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term and short-term debt and
capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by common stock dividend payments. The net cash provided from

(*)Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require
credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade.
Southern Power had $105 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2021.
The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements
that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade.
Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating
downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they
do so.
Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, have agreements under which Mississippi Power provides retail service
to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through at least 2038. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the
co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain
bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of
Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.
On October 27, 2021, S&P downgraded the Southern Company issuer credit rating to BBB+ from A-. Due to S&P's consolidated
rating methodology, the downgrade of Southern Company's issuer credit rating resulted in the downgrade of the senior unsecured
long-term debt rating of Alabama Power and the long-term issuer rating of Nicor Gas to A- from A, the senior unsecured long-term
debt ratings of Atlanta Gas Light, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas Capital to BBB+ from A-, and
the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Southern Company and Southern Power to BBB from BBB+. S&P revised its credit
rating outlook for Southern Company and its subsidiaries to stable from negative.
Market Price Risk
As a result of the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' market risk exposure decreased significantly. The other
Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2020. See Note 14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well
as Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional information. See Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.
Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric
operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the
guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in
natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its
wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling
agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has
been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating
capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of
contracts are priced at market.
Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations (primarily Sequent until its sale on July 1, 2021) routinely utilize
various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas
industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures
contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business also actively(*) (*)

manages storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing
natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale
and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining earnings. Some of these economic
hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas purchased (sold) at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas were as follows:
Southern
CompanySouthern
Company Gas
mmBtu Volume (in millions)
At December 31, 2021:
Commodity – Natural gas swaps 57 — 
Commodity – Natural gas options 253 68

At December 31, 2020:
Commodity – Natural gas swaps 262 — 
Commodity – Natural gas options 574 523 
Total hedge volume 836 523 
Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a
contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern
Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 6 million
mmBtu at December 31, 2021 and the net of long natural gas positions of 4.42 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of
3.90 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2020.
For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was approximately $0.74 per mmBtu
below market prices at December 31, 2021 and was equal to market prices at December 31, 2020. The change in option fair
value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all
of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost
recovery clauses.
The Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market
observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-
observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value
measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at
December 31, 2021 were as follows:

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
The Registrants are exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative
contracts, as applicable. The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have
investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit
exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note 14 to the financial statements.
Credit Risk
Southern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed
to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.
Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which
consist of the 16 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the
non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of
natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit
security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.
For 2021, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 15% of Southern Company
Gas' operating revenues and 17% of operating revenues for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment.
Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted
from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to
Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of
credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas
reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each
Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and
report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.
Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage
capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the
interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.
Wholesale Gas Services
Following the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas no longer has exposure to counterparty credit risk for
wholesale gas services. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for information on the sale of
Sequent.
Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit
reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company
Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements
and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns
physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch
ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (Southern
Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern
Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
Southern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility
subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 88% of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2021 and 86% of its consolidated total assets at December 31, 2021, are subject to rate regulation by their respective
state Public Service Commissions or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that the regulated utility subsidiaries meet
the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to
account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate
regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and
equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits
related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance
expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and
approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility
service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an
impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by
rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of
return on invested capital. While Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through
regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or
(2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and
remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future
regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future
rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a
refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future
decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the
rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the
subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates
that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the regulated utility subsidiaries, regulatory statutes,
interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the
likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of
similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded
regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
II-75
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Southern Company's regulated utility
subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that
might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Southern Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.
Disclosure of Uncertainties – Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction – Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment
in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact
of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by
the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its
ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and
schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery, including ongoing or future challenges
with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity,
particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain
craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units
3 and 4 move into initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant
systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial
operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the
projected schedule and estimated cost.
In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and
support activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future
regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these
costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as
Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $1.692 billion in
2021.
In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1)
the status of construction; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners
of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project.
We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties
that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit
matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate
regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the
ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the
construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the projected in-service dates for Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule and to
assess the disclosures of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of these
units.
•We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors),
independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and
schedule challenges.
II-76
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
•We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of
construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties
impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the
construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential
risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
•We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and
cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs
and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any
potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
•We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to
the licensing and commercial operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all
our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of
construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact
the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alabama Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Alabama Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Alabama Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Alabama Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Alabama Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Alabama Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Alabama Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Alabama Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income
taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and
depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Alabama Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory
proceedings based on an analysis of Alabama Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its
investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of
return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is
premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Alabama Power
expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1)
II-84
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a
reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs and the remaining net book
values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on
the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs,
(2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers.
Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the
Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting
process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of
audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates
that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Alabama Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Alabama Power and other interested parties
that may impact Alabama Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Georgia Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Georgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Georgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income
taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and
depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory
proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment
in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned
on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on
the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power expects to
recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1)
II-92
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a
reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and
remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future
regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future
rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a
refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future
decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the
rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the
subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates
that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Georgia Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Georgia Power and other interested parties
that may impact Georgia Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Georgia Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.
Disclosure of Uncertainties – Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction – Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in the construction of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by
Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the
Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover
its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject
to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery, including ongoing or future challenges with management of
contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the
installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or
related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into
initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or
components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global
nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and
estimated cost.
In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and
support activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in
II-93
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
future regulatory proceedings. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of
these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as
Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $1.692 billion in
2021.
In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1)
the status of construction; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners
of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project.
We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties
that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit
matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate
regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the
ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the
construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the projected in-service dates for Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule and to
assess the disclosures of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of these
units.
•We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors),
independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and
schedule challenges.
•We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of
construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties
impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the
construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential
risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
•We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and
cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs
and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any
potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
•We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to
the licensing and commercial operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all
our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of
construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact
the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Mississippi Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Mississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets – asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations;
deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues;
operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in
regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of,
its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate
of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates
is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi
Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not
II-101
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business
and a reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and
the remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of
future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in
future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, and/or (3) a refund to customers.
Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the
Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting
process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of
audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Mississippi Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Mississippi Power and other interested parties
that may impact Mississippi Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Mississippi Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and subsidiary companies (Southern
Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Power as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Southern Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Southern Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which is relates.
Income/Loss Allocation to Noncontrolling Interests – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Power has entered into a number of tax equity partnership arrangements, wherein they agree to sell 100% of a class of
membership interests (e.g. Class A) in an entity to a noncontrolling investor in exchange for cash contributions, while retaining
control of the entity through a separate class of membership interests (e.g. Class B). The agreements for these partnerships give
different rights and priorities to their owners in terms of cash distributions, tax attribute allocations, and partnership income or loss
allocations. These provisions make the conventional equity method of accounting where an investor applies its "percentage
ownership interest" to the investee's net income under generally accepted accounting principles to determine the investor's share of
earnings or losses difficult to apply. Therefore, Southern Power uses the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV)
accounting method to account for these partnership arrangements. The HLBV accounting method calculates each partner's share of
income or loss based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim at the end of the reporting period compared to the
beginning of the reporting period. The application of the HLBV accounting method by Southern Power required significant
consideration of the allocations between Southern Power and the noncontrolling investors over the life of the agreement and the
liquidation provisions of the agreement to determine the appropriate allocation of income or loss between the parties.
The determination of the appropriate amount of allocated partnership income or loss to noncontrolling interests using the HLBV
accounting method required increased audit effort and specialized skill and knowledge, including evaluation of the terms of the
agreement and consideration of the appropriateness of the HLBV model based on the provisions of the agreement.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures included the following, among others:
•For agreements that result in potentially material allocations of partnership income or loss, we read the agreements to
understand the liquidation provisions and the provisions governing the allocation of benefits.
•We evaluated the HLBV models utilized by management to determine whether the models accurately reflect the allocation of
income or loss and tax attributes in accordance with the liquidation provisions and allocation terms defined in the agreements,
as well as whether the inputs in the models are accurate and complete.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Company Gas and subsidiary companies (Southern
Company Gas) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company Gas as of December 31,
2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We did not audit the financial statements of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), Southern Company Gas' investment
which is accounted for by the use of the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Southern Company
Gas include its equity investment in SNG of $1,129 million and $1,167 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
respectively, and its earnings from its equity method investment in SNG of $127 million, $129 million, and $141 million for the
years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose reports
(which express unqualified opinions on SNG's financial statements and contain an emphasis of matter paragraph calling attention to
SNG's significant transactions with related parties) have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for SNG, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Company Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on Southern Company Gas' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
Southern Company Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Southern Company Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Company Gas' internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Southern Company Gas) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 84%
of Southern Company Gas' consolidated revenues, are subject to rate regulation in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia by
their respective state Public Service Commission or other applicable state regulatory agencies (collectively, the "Commissions").
Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of regulation. Accounting for the
economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to,
II-117
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred
charges and credits related to income taxes; operating revenues; other operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and
amortization.
The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and
approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility
service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an
impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by
rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of
return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers
through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility
service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the
impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1)
recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under
construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the
outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate
regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management
estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates
that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in
Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by
intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction
in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the
external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other
interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict
management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future
reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Members
Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C.
Houston, Texas
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Natural Gas Company, LLC (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, members' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial
statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
II-119
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Postretirement Benefit Obligation
At December 31, 2021, the Company's postretirement benefit obligation was $19 million and the Company's plan assets were $73
million, resulting in a net asset position of $54 million. As described in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the
postretirement benefit obligation is primarily based on actuarial calculations, which include various significant assumptions.
We identified the Company's estimate of the postretirement benefit obligation as a critical audit matter. Auditing the postretirement
benefit obligation required complex auditor judgment due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions used in the
calculation, which include the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions had a significant effect on
the postretirement benefit obligation calculation.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
•Comparing the actuarial assumptions used by management with historical trends and evaluating the change in the
postretirement benefit obligation from prior year due to changes in assumptions.
•Evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity
and duration of the benefit payments.
•Evaluating the expected return on plan assets by assessing whether management's assumptions were consistent with a
range of returns for a portfolio of comparative investments that was determined based on publicly available information.
Emphasis of Matter – Significant Transactions with Related Parties
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into significant transactions with related
parties.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General
Southern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern
Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated
utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages
power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.
Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas
Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other
complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1,
2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized
services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by
Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services
within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides
services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,
which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids
for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.
The Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant
influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary.
Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing
arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these
arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV
method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the
end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See "Variable Interest Entities" herein and Note 7 for additional
information.
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other
subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution
utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the
respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and
comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ
from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for
reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The
amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions
that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses
under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging
relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities
classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments
prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the
amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.
The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at
Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these
agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no
material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to

continue, the Registrants will continue to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2020–04 and the impacts of transitioning to an alternative
rate, and the ultimate outcome of the transition cannot be determined at this time. See Note 14 under "Interest Rate Derivatives" for
additional information.

from SCS totaled $28 million, $15 million, and $15 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and were charged to other
operations and maintenance expenses in Southern Power's consolidated statements of income.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural
gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally
liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 14 under "Contingent Features" for additional information.
Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above transactions on a
monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the purchase or sale of electricity. See "Revenues –
Southern Power" herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas provide incidental services to and
receive such services from other Southern Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. Except as
described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas neither provided nor
received any material services to or from affiliates in any year presented.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to accounting requirements for the
effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent costs recovered that are expected to be
incurred in the future or probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process.
In the event that a portion of a traditional electric operating company's or a natural gas distribution utility's operations is no longer
subject to applicable accounting rules for rate regulation, such company would be required to write off to income or reclassify to

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
AOCI related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the
traditional electric operating company or the natural gas distribution utility would be required to determine if any impairment to
other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities
are to be reflected in rates. See Note 2 for additional information including details of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the
balance sheets for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas.
Revenues
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources which are accounted for under various revenue accounting guidance,
including revenue from contracts with customers, lease, derivative, and regulatory accounting. See Notes 4, 9, and 14 for additional
information.
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The majority of the revenues of the traditional electric operating companies are generated from contracts with retail electric
customers. These revenues, generated from the integrated service to deliver electricity when and if called upon by the customer, are
recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over time, at a tariff rate, and as electricity is delivered to the customer
during the month. Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Retail rates may include
provisions to adjust revenues for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered from or returned to
customers, respectively, through adjustments to the billing factors. See Note 2 for additional information regarding regulatory
matters of the traditional electric operating companies.
Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms. Energy and other revenues are
generally recognized as services are provided. The contracts for capacity and energy in a wholesale PPA have multiple performance
obligations where the contract's total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling
price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services
transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, the traditional electric operating companies recognize revenue as the
performance obligations are satisfied over time as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is available to
the customer.
For both retail and wholesale revenues, the traditional electric operating companies have elected to recognize revenue for their sales
of electricity and capacity using the invoice practical expedient as they generally have a right to consideration in an amount that
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date and that may be invoiced. Payment for
goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of the Registrants' performance
obligation.
Southern Power
Southern Power sells capacity and energy at rates specified under contractual terms in long-term PPAs. These PPAs are accounted
for as leases, non-derivatives, or normal sale derivatives. Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as operating leases are recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Energy revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered.
Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as sales-type leases are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment
in the lease.
Southern Power's non-lease contracts commonly include capacity and energy which are considered separate performance
obligations. In these contracts, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling
price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services
transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Power recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are
satisfied over time, as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is made available to the customer.
Southern Power generally has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the
performance completed to date and may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. Payment for
goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of Southern Power's performance
obligation.
When multiple contracts exist with the same counterparty, the revenues from each contract are accounted for as separate
arrangements.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Southern Power may also enter into contracts to sell short-term capacity in the wholesale electricity markets. These sales are
generally classified as mark-to-market derivatives and net unrealized gains and losses on such contracts are recorded in wholesale
revenues. See Note 14 and "Financial Instruments" herein for additional information.
Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas records revenues when goods or services are provided to customers. Those revenues are based on rates
approved by the state regulatory agencies of the natural gas distribution utilities. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated natural
gas market whereby Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle
customer billing functions. As required by the Georgia PSC, Atlanta Gas Light bills Marketers in equal monthly installments for
each residential, commercial, and industrial end-use customer's distribution costs as well as for capacity costs utilizing a seasonal
rate design for the calculation of each residential end-use customer's annual straight-fixed-variable charge, which reflects the
historic volumetric usage pattern for the entire residential class.
The majority of the revenues of Southern Company Gas are generated from contracts with natural gas distribution customers.
Revenues from this integrated service to deliver gas when and if called upon by the customer are recognized as a single
performance obligation satisfied over time and are recognized at a tariff rate as gas is delivered to the customer during the month.
The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred
with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Company Gas recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are
satisfied over time as natural gas is delivered to the customer. The performance obligations related to wholesale gas services are
satisfied, and revenue is recognized, at a point in time when natural gas is delivered to the customer.
Southern Company Gas has elected to recognize revenue for sales of gas using the invoice practical expedient as it generally has a
right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date
and that may be invoiced. Payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction
of Southern Company Gas' performance obligation.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities have rate structures that include volumetric rate
designs that allow the opportunity to recover certain costs based on gas usage. Revenues from sales and transportation services are
recognized in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers. Revenues from residential and certain
commercial and industrial customers are recognized on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Additionally, unbilled revenues are
recognized for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers, from the last bill date to the end of the accounting
period. For other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries
through the end of the period.
The tariffs for the natural gas distribution utilities include provisions which allow for the recognition of certain revenues prior to the
time such revenues are billed to customers. These provisions are referred to as alternative revenue programs and provide for the
recognition of certain revenues prior to billing, as long as the amounts recognized will be collected from customers within 24
months of recognition. These programs are as follows:
•Weather normalization adjustments – reduce customer bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increase
customer bills when weather is warmer than normal and are included in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas and
Chattanooga Gas;
•Revenue normalization mechanisms – mitigate the impact of conservation and declining customer usage and are contained
in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas and Nicor Gas (effective November 1, 2019); and
•Revenue true-up adjustment – included within the provisions of the GRAM program in which Atlanta Gas Light
participates as a short-term alternative to formal rate case filings, the revenue true-up feature provides for a positive (or
negative) adjustment to record revenue in the amount of any variance to budgeted revenues, which are submitted and
approved annually as a requirement of GRAM. Such adjustments are reflected in customer billings in a subsequent
program year.
Wholesale Gas Services
Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas netted revenues from energy and risk management activities
with the associated costs. Profits from sales between segments were eliminated and recognized as goods or services sold to end-use
customers. Southern Company Gas recorded wholesale gas services' transactions that qualified as derivatives at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change and characterized as unrealized gains or losses. Gains
II-132
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
and losses on derivatives held for energy trading purposes were presented on a net basis in revenue. See Note 15 under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information on the sale of Sequent.
Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues from natural gas sales and transportation services in the same period in which the
related volumes are delivered to customers and recognizes sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial
customers on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Southern Company Gas also recognizes unbilled revenues for estimated
deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers from the most recent meter reading date to the end of the accounting period. For
other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries during the
period.
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues on 12-month utility-bill management contracts as the lesser of cumulative earned or
cumulative billed amounts.
Concentration of Revenue
Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power (with the exception of its full requirements cost-based
MRA electric tariffs described below), Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas each have a diversified base of customers and
no single customer or industry comprises 10% or more of each company's revenues.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based MRA electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the
FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 14.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021
and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and
any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Fuel Costs
Fuel costs for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense
generally includes fuel transportation costs and the cost of purchased emissions allowances as they are used. For Alabama Power
and Georgia Power, fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel. For the traditional electric operating
companies, fuel costs also include gains and/or losses from fuel-hedging programs as approved by their respective state PSCs.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, Southern Company Gas charges its utility
customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies.
Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to
regulatory review. Southern Company Gas defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of
commodity revenue earned in a given period such that no operating income is recognized related to these costs. The deferred or
accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred and
accrued natural gas costs are included in the balance sheets as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, respectively.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services' customers are charged for actual or estimated natural gas consumed. Within cost of
natural gas, Southern Company Gas also includes costs of lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of
inventories to market value, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Income Taxes
The Registrants use the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all
significant income tax temporary differences. In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional
electric operating companies are deferred and amortized over the average life of the related property, with such amortization
normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation and amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural
gas distribution utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are deferred and amortized to income
tax expense over the life of the respective asset.
Under current tax law, certain projects at Southern Power related to the construction of renewable facilities are eligible for federal
ITCs. Southern Power estimates eligible costs which, as they relate to acquisitions, may not be finalized until the allocation of the
purchase price to assets has been finalized. Southern Power applies the deferred method to ITCs, whereby the ITCs are recorded as
a deferred credit and amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. Furthermore, the tax basis of the asset is
reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation.
State ITCs are recognized as an income tax benefit in the period in which the credits are generated. In addition, certain projects are
eligible for federal and state PTCs, which are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production.
Federal ITCs and PTCs, as well as state ITCs and other state tax credits available to reduce income taxes payable, were not fully
utilized in 2021 and will be carried forward and utilized in future years. In addition, Southern Company is expected to have various
state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for certain of its subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power and Southern Power, which
would result in income tax benefits in the future, if utilized. See Note 10 under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes – Tax Credit
Carryforwards" and " – Net Operating Loss Carryforwards" for additional information.
The Registrants recognize tax positions that are "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination by the appropriate
taxing authorities. See Note 10 under "Unrecognized Tax Benefits" for additional information.
Other Taxes
Taxes imposed on and collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies are presented net on the Registrants'
statements of income and are excluded from the transaction price in determining the revenue related to contracts with a customer.
Southern Company Gas is taxed on its gas revenues by various governmental authorities, but is allowed to recover these taxes from
its customers. Revenue taxes imposed on the natural gas distribution utilities are recorded at the amount charged to customers,
which may include a small administrative fee, as operating revenues, and the related taxes imposed on Southern Company Gas are
recorded as operating expenses on the statements of income. Revenue taxes included in operating expenses were $119 million,
$104 million, and $114 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities record AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not
realized currently, AFUDC increases the revenue requirement and is recovered over the service life of the asset through a higher
rate base and higher depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not taxable.
Interest related to financing the construction of new facilities at Southern Power and new facilities not included in the traditional
electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' regulated rates is capitalized in accordance with standard interest
capitalization requirements.
Total AFUDC and interest capitalized for the Registrants in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was as follows:

(*)Excludes AFUDC related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional
information.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment
has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's
carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value
of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of
regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair
value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to
determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when
circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under "Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Leveraged Lease,"
respectively, and Note 15 under "Southern Company" and "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding impairment charges
recorded during the periods presented.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities
Southern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective
PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by
Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016
acquisition of PowerSecure.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2021
and determined no impairment was required. See Note 15 under "Southern Company" for information regarding impairments to
goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in 2019.

Acquisition Accounting
At the time of an acquisition, management will assess whether acquired assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For
acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, operating results from the date of acquisition are included in the acquiring
entity's financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition
of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the
relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and management may engage
independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and
typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts,
discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred for potential or
successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
Historically, contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once an acquired construction project is
placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, management fair values the arrangement with any changes
recorded in the statements of income. See Note 13 for additional fair value information.
Development Costs
For Southern Power, development costs are capitalized once a project is probable of completion, primarily based on a review of its
economics and operational feasibility, as well as the status of power off-take agreements and regulatory approvals, if applicable.
Southern Power's capitalized development costs are included in CWIP on the balance sheets. All of Southern Power's development
costs incurred prior to the determination that a project is probable of completion are expensed as incurred and included in other
operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income. If it is determined that a project is no longer probable of
completion, any of Southern Power's capitalized development costs are expensed and included in other operations and maintenance
expense in the statements of income.
Long-Term Service Agreements
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance
support for certain of their generating facilities. The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment,(a)

which generally includes the cost of all labor and materials. The LTSAs also obligate the counterparties to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in each contract.
Payments made under the LTSAs for the performance of any planned inspections or unplanned capital maintenance are recorded in
the statements of cash flows as investing activities. Receipts of major parts into materials and supplies inventory prior to planned
inspections are treated as noncash transactions in the statements of cash flows. Any payments made prior to the work being
performed are recorded as prepayments in other current assets and noncurrent assets on the balance sheets. At the time work is
performed, an appropriate amount is accrued for future payments or transferred from the prepayment and recorded as property,
plant, and equipment or expensed.
Transmission Receivables/Prepayments
As a result of Southern Power's acquisition and construction of generating facilities, Southern Power has transmission receivables
and/or prepayments representing the portion of interconnection network and transmission upgrades that will be reimbursed to
Southern Power. Upon completion of the related project, transmission costs are generally reimbursed by the interconnection
provider within a five-year period and the receivable/prepayments are reduced as payments or services are received.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments
are securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Storm Damage Reserves
Each traditional electric operating company maintains a reserve to cover or is allowed to defer and recover the cost of damages
from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and, for Mississippi Power, the cost of uninsured damages to its
generation facilities and other property. Alabama Power also has authority from the Alabama PSC to accrue certain additional
amounts as circumstances warrant. Alabama Power recorded additional accruals of $65 million, $100 million, and $84 million in
2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In accordance with their respective state PSC orders, the traditional electric operating
companies accrued the following amounts related to storm damage recovery in 2021, 2020, and 2019:

(a)Includes $39 million applied in 2019 to Alabama Power's NDR from its remaining excess deferred income tax regulatory liability balance in accordance with an
Alabama PSC order.
(b)Mississippi Power's net accrual includes carrying costs, as well as amortization of related excess deferred income tax benefits.
See Note 2 under "Alabama Power – Rate NDR," "Georgia Power – Storm Damage Recovery," and "Mississippi Power – System
Restoration Rider" for additional information regarding each company's storm damage reserve.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies for the traditional electric operating companies generally includes the average cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes propane gas
inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average
cost of generating plant materials.
Materials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as
appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and
then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.
Fuel Inventory
Fuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and
emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil,
natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost,
as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating
companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.
Natural Gas for Sale
With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. In Georgia's
deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly
basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along with a
corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related
natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.
Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored
prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not
restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of
natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for
differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or
Southern Company Gas' net income. At December 31, 2021, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $166 million. Based on the
average cost of gas purchased in December 2021, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2021
was $470 million.(a)(b) (a) (b)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services, wholesale gas services (until the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021), and all other
segments record inventory at LOCOM, with cost determined on a WACOG basis. For these segments, Southern Company Gas
evaluates the weighted average cost of its natural gas inventories against market prices to determine whether any declines in market
prices below the WACOG are other than temporary. For any declines considered to be other than temporary, Southern Company
Gas records LOCOM adjustments to cost of natural gas to reduce the value of its natural gas inventories to market value. LOCOM
adjustments for wholesale gas services were $1 million, $1 million, and $21 million during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and
were immaterial for all of Southern Company Gas' other segments.
Energy Marketing Receivables and Payables
Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services provided services to retail gas
marketers, wholesale gas marketers, utility companies, and industrial customers. These counterparties utilized netting agreements
that enabled wholesale gas services to net receivables and payables by counterparty upon settlement. Southern Company Gas'
wholesale gas services also netted across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral
agreements included such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, wholesale gas services' counterparties were settled
net, they were recorded on a gross basis in the balance sheets as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables.
Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services used established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of
counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral.
Collateral or credit security was most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution,
but could also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. When more than one derivative transaction with the
same counterparty was outstanding and a legally enforceable netting agreement existed with that counterparty, the "net" mark-to-
market exposure represented a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk with that counterparty. Southern
Company Gas' wholesale gas services also used other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducted
significant transactions.
Provision for Uncollectible Accounts
The customers of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are billed monthly. For the
majority of receivables, a provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on historical collection experience and other
factors. For the remaining receivables, if the company is aware of a specific customer's inability to pay, a provision for
uncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If
circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could
affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions.
Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts
averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.
Credit risk exposure at Nicor Gas is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides
for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis
and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.
See Note 2 for information regarding recovery of incremental bad debt expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic at certain of the
traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which
consist of 16 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the
lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for
the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of
natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to
obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from
Atlanta Gas Light.
Financial Instruments
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency
exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices,
weather, interest rates, and commodity prices. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheets (included in "Other" or shown separately as "Risk Management Activities") and are measured at
II-140

fair value. See Note 13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating
companies' and Southern Power's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are excluded
from fair value accounting requirements because they qualify for the "normal" scope exception, and are accounted for under the
accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the
traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of
related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other
derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net
basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category
as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.
The Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under
netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising
from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2021.
The Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The
Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties
in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of
warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in
natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic
value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.
Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services purchased natural gas for storage when the market price paid to
buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas was less than the market price that could be received
in the future, resulting in positive net natural gas revenues. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts were used to sell natural gas at that
future price to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that would ultimately be realized when the stored natural gas was sold.
Southern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its
customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the
locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical
flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at
fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in natural gas revenues on the statements of income in the
period of change. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
The purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as
appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with
the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation
capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements, and these demand charges and payments are recognized on
the statements of income in the period they are incurred. This difference in accounting methods can result in volatility in reported
earnings, even though the economic margin is substantially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.
Comprehensive Income
The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
from transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
net income attributable to the Registrant, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts
included in net income. Comprehensive income also consists of certain changes in pension and other postretirement benefit plans
for Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas.

Variable Interest Entities
The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required
to consolidate the VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE. See Note 7 for additional information regarding VIEs.
At December 31, 2020, Alabama Power had a wholly-owned trust to issue preferred securities; however, since Alabama Power was
not considered the primary beneficiary of the trust, the related investment at December 31, 2020 is reflected as other investments
and the related loan from the trust is reflected as long-term debt in Alabama Power's balance sheet. See Note 8 under "Long-term
Debt" for additional information.(*)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Georgia Power: Related amounts at December 31, 2021 include $145 million of deferred income tax assets related to CWIP for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and
approximately $220 million of deferred income tax liabilities. The recovery of deferred income tax assets related to CWIP for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is
expected to be determined in a future regulatory proceeding. Effective January 1, 2020, the deferred income tax liabilities are being amortized through 2022.
Mississippi Power: Related amounts at December 31, 2021 include $46 million of retail deferred income tax liabilities generally being amortized over three
years (through 2023). See "Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case" herein for additional information.

Alabama Power
Alabama Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight
of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE,
Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting
Alabama Power.
Certificates of Convenience and Necessity
In August 2020, the Alabama PSC issued its order regarding Alabama Power's 2019 petition for a CCN, which authorized Alabama
Power to (i) construct an approximately 720-MW combined cycle facility at Alabama Power's Plant Barry (Plant Barry Unit 8) that
is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2023, (ii) complete the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station,
which occurred in August 2020, (iii) purchase approximately 240 MWs of combined cycle generation under a long-term PPA,
which began in September 2020, and (iv) pursue up to approximately 200 MWs of cost-effective demand-side management and
distributed energy resource programs. Alabama Power's petition for a CCN was predicated on the results of Alabama Power's 2019
IRP provided to the Alabama PSC, which identified an approximately 2,400-MW resource need for Alabama Power, driven by the
need for additional winter reserve capacity. See Note 15 under "Alabama Power" for additional information on the acquisition of
the Central Alabama Generating Station.
The Alabama PSC authorized the recovery of actual costs for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 up to 5% above the estimated
in-service cost of $652 million. In so doing, it recognized the potential for developments that could cause the project costs to
exceed the capped amount, in which case Alabama Power would provide documentation to the Alabama PSC to explain and justify
potential recovery of the additional costs. At December 31, 2021, project expenditures associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 included
in CWIP totaled approximately $304 million.
The Alabama PSC further directed that additional solar generation of approximately 400 MWs proposed in the 2019 CCN petition,
coupled with battery energy storage systems (solar/battery systems), be evaluated under an existing Renewable Generation
Certificate (RGC). The contracts originally proposed expired in July 2020. See "Renewable Generation Certificate" herein for
additional information.
Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 pursuant to its Rate CNP New Plant. Alabama Power is
recovering all costs associated with the Central Alabama Generating Station through the inclusion in Rate RSE of revenues from
the existing power sales agreement and, on expiration of that agreement, expects to recover costs pursuant to Rate CNP New Plant.
The recovery of costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry are expected to be
recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. Alabama Power expects to recover the capacity-related costs associated with the PPAs
through its Rate CNP PPA. In addition, fuel and energy-related costs are expected to be recovered through Rate ECR. Any
remaining costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 and the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station are expected to
be recovered through Rate RSE.
On September 23, 2021, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Calhoun Power
Company, LLC, which owns and operates a 743-MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun
County, Alabama (Calhoun Generating Station). The total purchase price associated with the acquisition is approximately
$180 million, subject to working capital adjustments. The completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction and waiver of
certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC.
On October 28, 2021, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC to procure additional generating capacity
through this acquisition. Completion of the acquisition and certain operating conditions would enable Alabama Power to retire
Plant Barry Unit 5 as early as 2023. A decision from the Alabama PSC is expected by the third quarter 2022. Pending certification,
Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with the Calhoun Generating Station through its existing rate structure,
primarily Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.
Alabama Power expects to complete the transaction by September 30, 2022; however, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.
Renewable Generation Certificate
Through the issuance of a RGC, the Alabama PSC has authorized Alabama Power to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity
and energy by September 16, 2027 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third
parties. Through December 31, 2021, Alabama Power has procured approximately 250 MWs through five projects approved
II-146

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
under the RGC. Alabama Power owns two of the projects, totaling 18 MWs, with the remaining MWs expected to be served
through three PPAs, two of which will commence in the first quarter 2024.
Rate RSE
The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected
weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking
information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together,
cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is
an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting
point if Alabama Power (i) has an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top
one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.
Alabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances,
thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of
2025. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 51.6%.
Effective for January 2019, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE. These modifications reduced the top of the
allowed WCER range from 6.21% to 6.15% and modified the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results to allow
Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range. These
modifications were designed to position Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax
Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term.
Generally, during a year without a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%,
customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of
the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%. During a year
with a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER exceeds 6.15%, customers receive 50% of the amount
between 6.15% and 6.90% and all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 6.90%. There is no provision for additional customer
billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range.
In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward adjustments under
Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and to return $50 million to customers through bill credits in 2019. Retail rates under Rate RSE
remained unchanged for 2019 and 2020 and increased by 4.09%, or approximately $228 million annually, effective with the billing
month of January 2021.
At December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, Alabama Power's WCER exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a
current regulatory liability of $53 million, $50 million, and $181 million, respectively, for Rate RSE refunds. The 2019 and 2020
refunds were issued to customers through bill credits in April of the following year. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order
issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power will apply $126 million of the 2021 refund to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered
balance and the remaining $55 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022. See "Rate ECR" herein for
additional information.
On December 1, 2021, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for
calendar year 2022. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged
for 2022.
Rate CNP New Plant
Rate CNP New Plant allows for recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with newly developed or acquired certificated
generating facilities placed into retail service. No adjustments to Rate CNP New Plant occurred during the period 2019 through
2021. See "Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" herein for additional information.
Rate CNP PPA
Rate CNP PPA allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with certificated PPAs. Revenues for Rate CNP
PPA, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama
Power's revenues or net income but will affect annual cash flow. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2019
through 2021 and no adjustment is expected for 2022. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Alabama Power had an under recovered
Rate CNP PPA balance of $84 million and $58 million, respectively, which is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the
balance sheet.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Rate CNP Compliance
Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such
mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar
considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information
and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama PSC by December
1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance
expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial
statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly,
changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or net income, but
will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation
generally will have no effect on net income.
In November 2019, 2020, and 2021, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with
governmental mandates for the following calendar year, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The 2019 filing reflected a
projected over recovered retail revenue requirement, which resulted in a rate decrease of approximately $68 million that became
effective for the billing month of January 2020. Both the 2020 and 2021 filings reflected a projected under recovered retail revenue
requirement of approximately $59 million. In December 2020 and on December 7, 2021, the Alabama PSC issued consent orders
that Alabama Power leave the 2020 Rate CNP Compliance factors in effect for 2021 and 2022, respectively, with any prior year
under collected amount deemed recovered before any current year amounts are recovered. Any remaining under recovered amount
will be reflected in the 2022 filing.
At December 31, 2021, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $16 million included in other
regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, Alabama Power had an over recovered Rate CNP
Compliance balance of $28 million included in other regulatory liabilities, current on the balance sheet.
Rate ECR
Rate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under
recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in
actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts
billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the
Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is
required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but
will impact operating cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.
In 2019, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 2.353 cents per KWH to 2.160 cents per KWH, equal to 1.82%,
or approximately $102 million annually, that became effective for the billing month of January 2020.
In October 2020, Alabama Power reduced its over-collected fuel balance by $94 million in accordance with an August 2020
Alabama PSC order and returned that amount to customers in the form of bill credits.
In December 2020, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 2.160 cents per KWH to 1.960 cents per KWH, equal
to 1.84%, or approximately $103 million annually, that became effective for the billing month of January 2021.
On December 7, 2021, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order that Alabama Power leave the 2021 Rate ECR factors in effect for
2022. The rate will adjust to 5.910 cents per KWH in January 2023 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC.
At December 31, 2021, Alabama Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled $126 million and is included in other regulatory assets,
deferred on the balance sheet. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power will apply
$126 million of its 2021 Rate RSE refund to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance. See "Rate RSE" herein for additional
information. At December 31, 2020, Alabama Power's over recovered fuel costs totaled $18 million and is included in other
regulatory liabilities, current on the balance sheet. These classifications are based on estimates, which include such factors as
weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these factors could have a significant
impact on the timing of any recovery or return of fuel costs.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Software Accounting Order
In 2019, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for
operations and maintenance costs associated with software implementation projects. The regulatory asset will be amortized ratably
over the life of the related software. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the regulatory asset balance totaled $35 million and
$17 million, respectively, and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet.
Plant Greene County
Alabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership
Agreements" for additional information. On September 9, 2021, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the conclusion of
its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP with no deficiencies identified. Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP included a schedule to
retire Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 in December 2025 and 2026, respectively,
consistent with each unit's remaining useful life. The Plant Greene County unit retirements identified by Mississippi Power require
the completion of transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will
continue to monitor the status of the transmission and system reliability improvements. Currently, Alabama Power plans to retire
Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 at the dates indicated. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Rate NDR
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover
the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate
NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve
balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below $50 million, a reserve
establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve
balance reaches $75 million.
The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and
maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a 24-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority
to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent further Alabama
PSC approval, the maximum total Rate NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month per non-residential customer
account and $5 per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama
PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. The order allows for reliability-related expenditures to be
charged against the additional accruals when the NDR balance exceeds $75 million. Alabama Power may designate a portion of the
NDR to reliability-related expenditures as a part of an annual budget process for the following year or during the current year for
identified unbudgeted reliability-related expenditures that are incurred. Accruals that have not been designated can be used to offset
storm charges. Additional accruals to the NDR enhance Alabama Power's ability to mitigate the financial effects of future natural
disasters, promote system reliability, and offset costs retail customers would otherwise bear. Alabama Power made additional
accruals of $65 million, $100 million, and $84 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Alabama Power collected approximately $6 million, $5 million, and $16 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, under Rate
NDR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the NDR balance was $103 million and $77 million, respectively, and is included in other
regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheets. Beginning with June 2022 billings, the reserve establishment charge will be
suspended and the reserve maintenance charge will be activated as a result of the NDR balance exceeding $75 million. Alabama
Power expects to collect $8 million in 2022 and approximately $3 million annually beginning in 2023 under Rate NDR unless the
NDR balance falls below $50 million.
As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR
will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash
flows.
Environmental Accounting Order
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is authorized to establish a
regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered
costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The
regulatory asset is amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision
regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of
the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2019 ARP, which
includes traditional base tariffs, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, the ECCR tariff, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF)
tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the
NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a fuel cost recovery tariff, both under separate regulatory proceedings.
See "Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding" herein for information regarding the approved recovery through
retail base rates of certain costs related to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the common facilities shared between Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
(Common Facilities) that will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. As costs are included in retail base rates,
the related financing costs will no longer be recovered through the NCCR tariff. See "Nuclear Construction" herein for additional
information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Rate Plans
2019 ARP
In 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2019 ARP, under which Georgia Power increased its rates on January 1, 2020. In
December 2020 and on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective January 1, 2021 and 2022,
respectively. Details of tariff adjustments are provided in the table below:
Tariff 2020 2021 2022

MFF 12 4 2 
Total $ 342 $ 111 $ 157 
(*)    Effective January 1, 2020, CCR AROs are being recovered through the ECCR tariff.
In 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's modified triennial IRP (Georgia Power 2019 IRP), including Georgia
Power's proposed environmental compliance strategy associated with ash pond and certain landfill closures and post-closure care in
compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery of the estimated
under recovered balance of these compliance costs at December 31, 2019 over a three-year period ending December 31, 2022 and
recovery of estimated compliance costs for 2020, 2021, and 2022 over three-year periods ending December 31, 2022, 2023, and
2024, respectively, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditure. The ECCR tariff
is revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through annual compliance filings. Effective January 1, 2021 and 2022,
Georgia Power adjusted its amortization of costs associated with CCR AROs by an approximate decrease of $90 million and
increase of $10 million, respectively, as approved by the Georgia PSC in conjunction with Georgia Power's annual compliance
filings. See "Integrated Resource Plan" herein for additional information.
In February 2020, the Georgia PSC denied a motion for reconsideration filed by the Sierra Club regarding the Georgia PSC's
decision in the 2019 ARP allowing Georgia Power to recover compliance costs for CCR AROs. The Superior Court of Fulton
County subsequently affirmed the Georgia PSC's decision and, on October 25, 2021, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the
Superior Court of Fulton County's order. On December 6, 2021, the Sierra Club filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Georgia
Supreme Court. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 6 for additional information
regarding Georgia Power's AROs.
Under the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.50%, and earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of
9.50% to 12.00%. Any retail earnings above 12.00% will be shared, with 40% being applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40%
directly refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings
shortfall below 9.50% on an actual basis. However, if at any time during the term of the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power projects that its
retail earnings will be below 9.50% for any calendar year, it could petition the Georgia PSC for implementation of the Interim Cost
Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Power's retail rates to achieve a 9.50% ROE. The Georgia PSC would have 90 days to rule
on Georgia Power's request. The ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2023 or the end of the calendar year in which
the ICR tariff becomes effective. In lieu of requesting implementation of an ICR tariff, or if the Georgia PSC chooses not to
implement the ICR tariff, Georgia Power may file a full rate case. In 2020, Georgia Power's retail ROE was within the allowed(*)

retail ROE range. In 2021, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by
approximately $5 million and accrued approximately $5 million to refund to customers in 2022, subject to review and approval by
the Georgia PSC.
Additionally, under the 2019 ARP and pursuant to the sharing mechanism approved in the 2013 ARP whereby two-thirds of any
earnings above the top of the allowed ROE range are shared with Georgia Power's customers, (i) Georgia Power used 50%
(approximately $50 million) of the customer share of earnings above the band in 2018 to reduce regulatory assets and refunded
50% (approximately $50 million) to customers in 2020 and (ii) Georgia Power agreed to forego its share of 2019 earnings in excess
of the earnings band so 50% (approximately $60 million) of all earnings over the 2019 band were refunded to customers in 2020
and 50% (approximately $60 million) were used to reduce regulatory assets.
Georgia Power is required to file a general base rate case by July 1, 2022, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected
to determine whether the 2019 ARP should be continued, modified, or discontinued.
2013 ARP
Georgia Power's retail ROE under the 2013 ARP was set at 10.95% and earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of
10.00% to 12.00%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.00% were to be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-
third retained by Georgia Power. In 2019 and 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00% and, under the modified sharing
mechanism pursuant to the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by a total of approximately $110 million and
accrued approximately $110 million for retail customer refunds through bill credits that were completed in 2020. See "2019 ARP"
herein for additional information.
Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding
On June 15, 2021, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia PSC to adjust retail base rates to include the portion of costs
related to its investment in Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities previously deemed prudent by the Georgia PSC, as well as
the related costs of operation. On November 2, 2021, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's application as filed, with
the following modifications pursuant to a stipulated agreement between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC. Georgia
Power will include in rate base an allocation of $2.1 billion to Unit 3 and Common Facilities from the $3.6 billion of Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4 previously deemed prudent by the Georgia PSC and will recover the related depreciation expense through retail base
rates effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. Financing costs on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the
Common Facilities construction costs will continue to be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power will defer
as a regulatory asset the remaining depreciation expense (approximately $38 million annually) until Unit 4 costs are placed in retail
base rates. In addition, the stipulated agreement clarified that following the prudency review, the remaining amount to be placed in
retail base rates will be net of the proceeds from the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and will not be used to offset imprudent
costs, if any.
The related increase in annual retail base rates of approximately $302 million also includes recovery of all projected operations and
maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related
production tax credits, and will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. This increase is partially offset by a
decrease in the NCCR tariff of approximately $78 million effective January 1, 2022. As approved by the Georgia PSC, the increase
in annual retail base rates will be adjusted based on the actual in-service date of Plant Vogtle Unit 3.
See "Nuclear Construction" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Integrated Resource Plan
In 2021, as authorized in its 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested and received certification from the Georgia PSC for 970 MWs of
utility-scale PPAs for solar generation resources, which are expected to be in operation by the end of 2023.
On January 31, 2022, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2022 IRP). The filing included a request to decertify and retire Plant
Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership) by August 31, 2022; Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) by
December 31, 2027; and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs
based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) by December 31, 2028. See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for additional information.
In the 2022 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2
(approximately $610 million at December 31, 2021), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (approximately $937 million at December 31,
2021), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (approximately $622 million at December 31, 2021) and any remaining unusable materials and
supplies inventories upon each unit's respective retirement dates to a regulatory asset, with recovery periods to be determined in
future base rate cases.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
In addition, the 2022 IRP includes requests for approval of the following:
•Capital, operations and maintenance, and CCR ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care.
The recovery of these costs is expected to be determined in future base rate cases;
•Installation of environmental controls at Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 (1,760 MWs) and Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs
based on 8.4% ownership) for compliance with ELG rules;
•Investments related to the hydro operations of Plants Sinclair (45 MWs), North Highlands (30 MWs), and Burton (6 MWs);
•Establishment of a request for proposals (RFP) process for 2,300 MWs of renewable resources by 2029. Georgia Power
expects to request an additional 3,700 MWs by 2035 through future IRP proceedings;
•Procurement of 1,000 MWs of Georgia Power-owned storage resources by 2030, including the development of a 265-MW
battery energy storage facility beginning in 2026;
•Related transmission costs necessary to support the proposed retirements and renewable resources previously described;
•Certification of six PPAs (including five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power that are also subject to approval by the FERC)
with capacities of 1,567 MWs beginning in 2024, 380 MWs beginning in 2025, and 228 MWs beginning in 2028, procured
through RFPs approved through the 2019 IRP; and
•Certification of approximately 88 MWs of wholesale capacity to be placed in retail rate base between January 1, 2024 and
January 1, 2025.
A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2022 IRP is expected in July 2022. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time.
Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs
In April 2020 and June 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Georgia Power
to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections through July 14, 2020 and to defer the resulting
incremental bad debt as a regulatory asset. In June 2020 and July 2020, the Georgia PSC approved orders establishing a
methodology for identifying incremental bad debt and allowing the deferral of other incremental costs associated with the COVID-
19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, the incremental costs deferred totaled approximately $38 million (including approximately
$23 million of incremental bad debt costs and $15 million of other incremental costs). Since June 2021, Georgia Power has
continued a review of bad debt amounts deferred under the Georgia PSC-approved methodology, including consideration of actual
amounts repaid by customers from arrears and installment plans after the disconnection moratorium period ended. As a result,
Georgia Power's incremental costs deferred at December 31, 2021 totaled approximately $21 million, including an immaterial
amount of incremental bad debt costs. The period over which these costs will be recovered is expected to be determined in Georgia
Power's next base rate case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In May 2020, the Georgia PSC approved a
stipulation agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors to lower total fuel billings by
approximately $740 million over a two-year period effective June 1, 2020. In addition, Georgia Power further lowered fuel billings
by approximately $44 million under an interim fuel rider effective June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During the second
half of 2021, the price of natural gas rose significantly and resulted in an under recovered fuel balance exceeding $200 million.
Therefore, on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's interim fuel rider, which increased fuel rates
by 15%, or approximately $252 million annually, effective January 1, 2022. Georgia Power continues to be allowed to adjust its
fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the over recovered fuel balance exceeds $200
million. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its next fuel case no later than February 28, 2023.
Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled $410 million at December 31, 2021 and is included in other deferred charges
and assets on Southern Company's balance sheet and deferred under recovered fuel clause revenues on Georgia Power's balance
sheet. At December 31, 2020, Georgia Power's over recovered fuel balance totaled $113 million and is included in other current
liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheet and over recovered fuel clause revenues on Georgia Power's balance sheet.
Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and
approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 36-month time horizon.
Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and
amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern
Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.

Storm Damage Recovery
Georgia Power defers and recovers certain costs related to damages from major storms as mandated by the Georgia PSC. Beginning
January 1, 2020, Georgia Power is recovering $213 million annually under the 2019 ARP. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was $48 million and $262 million, respectively, with $48 million and $213
million, respectively, included in other regulatory assets, current on Southern Company's balance sheets and regulatory assets –
storm damage on Georgia Power's balance sheets and $49 million at December 31, 2020 included in other regulatory assets,
deferred on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be
adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not
expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements.
Nuclear Construction
In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, in which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership
interest. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the
two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin.
Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a
substantially fixed price agreement.
In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing in March 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the
other Vogtle Owners, entered into several transitional arrangements to allow construction to continue. In July 2017, Georgia Power,
acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement, whereby Westinghouse
provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and
materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the
Vogtle Owners upon 30 days' written notice.
In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost
reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is
subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not
jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel
Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle
Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the
base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may
terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain
breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events.
See Note 8 under "Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" for information on the Amended and Restated Loan
Guarantee Agreement, including applicable covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events.
Cost and Schedule
Georgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,
including contingency, through the end of the first quarter 2023 and the fourth quarter 2023, respectively, is as follows:
(in millions)
Base project capital cost forecast $ 10,251 
Construction contingency estimate 150 
Total project capital cost forecast 10,401 
Net investment at December 31, 2021 (8,442)
Remaining estimate to complete $ 1,959 
(a)Includes approximately $590 million of costs that are not shared with the other Vogtle Owners and approximately $440 million of incremental costs under the
cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below. Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of
approximately $375 million, of which $195 million had been accrued through December 31, 2021.
(b)Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds.
Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $3.4 billion,
of which $2.9 billion had been incurred through December 31, 2021.(a)(b)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to
incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers
and related test results, and workforce statistics. Southern Nuclear establishes aggressive target values for monthly construction
production and system turnover activities, which are reflected in the site work plans.
In mid-March 2020, Southern Nuclear began implementing policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of transmission of
COVID-19 at the construction site, including worker distancing measures; isolating individuals who tested positive for COVID-19,
showed symptoms consistent with COVID-19, were being tested for COVID-19, or were in close contact with such persons;
requiring self-quarantine; and adopting additional precautionary measures. Since March 2020, the number of active cases at the site
has fluctuated consistent with the surrounding area and impacted productivity levels and pace of activity completion, with the site
experiencing peaks in the number of active cases in January 2021, August 2021, and January 2022. Georgia Power estimates the
productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin
previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4. Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental
cost associated with COVID-19 mitigation actions and impacts on construction productivity is currently estimated to be between
$160 million and $200 million and is included in the total project capital cost forecast. The continuing effects of the COVID-19
pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
During 2021, Southern Nuclear performed additional construction remediation work necessary to ensure quality and design
standards are met and support system turnovers necessary for Unit 3 hot functional testing, which was completed in July 2021, and
fuel load. As a result of Unit 3 challenges including, but not limited to, construction productivity, construction remediation work,
the pace of system turnovers, spent fuel pool repairs, and the timeframe and duration for hot functional and other testing, at the end
of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for
Unit 3, from those established in January 2021. Through the fourth quarter 2021, the project continued to face these and other
challenges related to the completion of documentation, including inspection records, necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs
and begin fuel load. As a result, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates,
including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan currently targets fuel
load for Unit 3 in the second quarter 2022 and an in-service date during the third quarter 2022 and primarily depends on significant
improvements in overall construction productivity and production levels, the volume of construction remediation work, the pace of
system and area turnovers, and the progression of startup and other testing. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to these
milestone dates, an in-service date during the fourth quarter 2022 or the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 is projected, although any
further delays could result in a later in-service date.
As the result of productivity challenges and temporarily diverting some Unit 4 craft and support resources to Unit 3 construction
efforts, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear also further extended milestone dates for Unit 4
from those established in January 2021. The temporary diversion of Unit 4 resources to support Unit 3 has continued into the first
quarter 2022; therefore, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from
those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan targets an in-service date during the first quarter 2023 for
Unit 4 and primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as
appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electricians and pipefitters, being added and maintained. As the site work plan
includes minimal margin to the milestone dates, an in-service date during the third or fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4 is projected,
although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.
During 2021, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $1.3 billion were assigned to the base capital cost
forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, and
support resources for Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power also increased its total capital cost forecast as of December 31, 2021 by
$99 million to replenish construction contingency.
After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate
outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in
future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021,
the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021 of $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax),
$264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project
capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during the
prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described below. In addition,
Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after
tax) for incremental costs, which will not be recovered from retail customers, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions
of the joint ownership agreements described below.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
As Unit 3 completes system turnover from construction and moves to testing and transition to operations, ongoing and potential
future challenges include completion of construction remediation work, completion of work packages, including inspection records,
and other documentation necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load, and final component and pre-operational
tests. As Unit 4 progresses through construction and continues to transition into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges
include the pace and quality of electrical installation, availability of craft and supervisory resources, including the temporary
diversion of such resources to support Unit 3 construction efforts, and the pace of work package closures and system turnovers. As
construction, including subcontract work, continues on both Units 3 and 4, ongoing or future challenges include management of
contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the
installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or
related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into
initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or
components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global
nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and
estimated cost.
There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal
and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the
requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses,
including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. In connection with the additional
construction remediation work described above, Southern Nuclear reviewed the project's construction quality programs and, where
needed, is implementing improvement plans consistent with these processes. On November 17, 2021, the NRC issued the final
significance report on its special inspection to review the root cause of this additional construction remediation work and the
corresponding corrective action plans with two findings of low to moderate safety significance. Southern Nuclear had already
identified and self-reported many of the issues in this report to the NRC and implemented corrective-action plans to resolve these
issues. The NRC will conduct a follow-up inspection on these findings at a future date. Findings resulting from this or other
inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests
have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC.
The site work plan currently targets fuel load for Units 3 and 4 in the second quarter 2022 and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively.
Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC
documentation for each unit and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load
fuel, have arisen or may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license
amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely
manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the
first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4, including the current level of cost sharing described below, is
estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per
month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While
Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts
related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below, management will ultimately
determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable
through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.
Joint Owner Contracts
In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective in August 2018, the Vogtle
Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint
ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle
Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against
Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners
is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements
In connection with a September 2018 vote by the Vogtle Owners to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding
term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power
SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take
certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments
to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and
(ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide up to $300 million of funding with respect
to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. In January 2019, Georgia Power,
MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February
2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and
MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the
Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).
Pursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia
Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in
the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners
responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be
responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM
(resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible
for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC
in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the
project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's
agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth
VCM plus $2.1 billion.
In addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii)
the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement,
or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate
recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's
costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional
amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the
first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which
Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more from the
seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The
latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the
holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may
require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8
under "Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" for additional information.
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases
subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact
the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is
$18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other Vogtle Owners have
asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the
Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately
$440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project
capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately
$460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated
with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle
Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a
decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February
14, 2022.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%; however, it could increase if one or more
of the other Vogtle Owners exercise the option to tender a portion of their ownership interest to Georgia Power and require Georgia
Power to pay 100% of the remaining share of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's
incremental ownership interest would be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in
service.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Regulatory Matters
In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of $4.418 billion.
In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and
the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR
tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power had recovered approximately $2.7
billion of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion are being recognized through AFUDC and
are expected to be recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; however, Georgia Power is not
recording AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently $7.3 billion)
and not requested for rate recovery. On November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to decrease the
NCCR tariff by $78 million annually, effective January 1, 2022.
Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In
2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of
the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009
certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia
Power.
In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency
matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related
order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The
Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth
VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was
reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed
from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable
and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that
any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact
of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related customer refunds) was found reasonable; (iv)
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as
primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in
service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost
cap and that a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur following Unit 4 fuel load, consistent with applicable Georgia law;
(vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia
PSC in the 2013 ARP) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from 10.00% to 8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from
8.30% to 5.30%, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of
long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's
average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that effective the first month after Unit 3 reaches
commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include the costs related to Unit 3 and common facilities deemed
prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement (see "Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding" herein for
additional information). The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational
by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis
points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially
operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $270 million, $150 million, and $75 million in
2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $300 million and $265
million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and
assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right
to reconsider the decision to continue construction.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
The Georgia PSC has approved 24 VCM reports covering periods through December 31, 2020, including total construction capital
costs incurred through December 31, 2020 of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement
Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). In the August 24, 2021 order approving the twenty-fourth
VCM report, the Georgia PSC also approved a stipulation addressing the following matters: (i) beginning with its twenty-fifth
VCM report, Georgia Power will continue to report to the Georgia PSC all costs incurred during the period for review and will
request for approval costs up to the $7.3 billion determined to be reasonable in the Georgia PSC's seventeenth VCM order and (ii)
Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery of the $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth
VCM report and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter 2018. In addition, the stipulation confirms Georgia
Power may request verification and approval of costs above $7.3 billion for inclusion in rate base at a later time, but no earlier than
the prudence review contemplated by the seventeenth VCM order described previously. The Georgia PSC is scheduled to vote on
the twenty-fifth VCM report on February 17, 2022. Georgia Power also expects to file its twenty-sixth VCM report with the
Georgia PSC on February 17, 2022, which will reflect the revised capital cost forecast described above.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC.
Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs.
These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the
costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses
are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates.
2019 Base Rate Case
In March 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff related to Mississippi Power's base rate case filed in 2019 (Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement).
Under the terms of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement, annual retail rates decreased approximately
$16.7 million, or 1.85%, effective for the first billing cycle of April 2020, based on a test year period of January 1, 2020 through
December 31, 2020, a 53% average equity ratio, an allowed maximum actual equity ratio of 55% by the end of 2020, and a 7.57%
return on investment.
Additionally, the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement: (i) established common amortization periods of four years
for regulatory assets and three years for regulatory liabilities included in the approved revenue requirement, including those related
to unprotected deferred income taxes; (ii) established new depreciation rates reflecting an annual increase in depreciation of
approximately $10 million; and (iii) excluded certain compensation costs totaling approximately $3.9 million. It also eliminated
separate rates for costs associated with Plant Ratcliffe and energy efficiency initiatives and includes such costs in the PEP, ECO
Plan, and ad valorem tax adjustment factor, as applicable.
Performance Evaluation Plan
Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. In recognition
that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, PEP includes
performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi
Power's performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to
prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric
service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Typically, two PEP filings are made
for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing and the PEP lookback filing. In July 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved
Mississippi Power's revisions to the PEP compliance rate clause as agreed to in the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement
Agreement. These revisions include, among other things, changing the filing date for the annual PEP rate projected filing from
November of the immediately preceding year to March of the current year, utilizing a historic test year adjusted for "known and
measurable" changes, using discounted cash flow and regression formulas to determine base ROE, and moving all embedded ad
valorem property taxes currently collected in PEP to the ad valorem tax adjustment clause. The PEP lookback filing will continue to
be filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement.
Pursuant to a Mississippi PSC-approved settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the MPUS, Mississippi Power was
not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2019 and 2020. On June 8, 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved
Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing for 2021, resulting in an annual increase in revenues of approximately $16 million, or
1.8%, which became effective with the first billing cycle of April 2021.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Integrated Resource Plan
In 2019, Mississippi Power updated its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP), originally filed in 2018, as required by the
Mississippi PSC. In 2018, Mississippi Power had proposed alternatives to reduce its reserve margin and lower or avoid operating
costs. In December 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order concluding the RMP docket and requiring Mississippi Power to
incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027
to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin. The order stated that Mississippi Power will be allowed to defer any
retirement-related costs as regulatory assets for future recovery.
On September 9, 2021, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the conclusion of its review of Mississippi Power's 2021
IRP with no deficiencies identified. The 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Mississippi
Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (103 MWs each) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026,
respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the
schedule reflects the early retirement of Mississippi Power's 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502
MWs) by the end of 2027. The Plant Greene County unit retirements require the completion by Alabama Power of transmission and
system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power.
The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately $515 million at December 31, 2021 and Mississippi
Power is continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates through the end of 2027. Mississippi Power expects
to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement, which is expected to total approximately $386 million, to a regulatory asset
to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings, consistent with the December 2020
order. The Plant Watson and Greene County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement. The ultimate outcome of
these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under "Other Matters – Mississippi Power" for additional information
on Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2.
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan
In accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory
asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations.
In accordance with a Mississippi PSC-approved settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the MPUS, Mississippi
Power was not required to make any ECO Plan filings for 2019 and 2020, and any necessary adjustments were reflected in
Mississippi Power's 2019 base rate case.
In 2019, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's request for a CPCN to complete certain environmental compliance
projects, primarily associated with the Plant Daniel coal units co-owned 50% with Gulf Power. The total estimated cost is
approximately $125 million, with Mississippi Power's share of approximately $67 million being proposed for recovery through its
ECO Plan. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $20 million of Mississippi Power's share is included in plant in service,
approximately $14 million is included in CWIP, and approximately $13 million associated with ash pond closure is reflected in
Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. See Note 6 for additional information on AROs and Note 3 under "Other Matters – Mississippi
Power" for additional information on Gulf Power's ownership in Plant Daniel.
On June 8, 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2021, resulting in a decrease in revenues
of approximately $9 million annually, primarily due to a change in the amortization periods of certain regulatory assets and
liabilities. The rate decrease became effective with the first billing cycle of July 2021.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Mississippi Power annually establishes and is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost recovery factor that is
approved by the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC approved decreases of $35 million and $24 million effective in February
2019 and 2020, respectively, and increases of $2 million and $43 million effective in February 2021 and 2022, respectively. At
December 31, 2021, under recovered retail fuel costs totaled approximately $4 million and were included in other customer
accounts receivable on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, over recovered retail
fuel costs totaled $24 million and were included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheet and over
recovered regulatory clause liabilities on Mississippi Power's balance sheet.
Mississippi Power has wholesale MRA and Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factors. Effective with the first billing cycles for
January 2020, 2021, and 2022, annual revenues under the wholesale MRA fuel rate increased $1 million, decreased $5 million, and
increased $11 million, respectively. The wholesale MB fuel rate did not change materially in any period presented. At December
31, 2021, under recovered wholesale fuel costs were immaterial. At December 31, 2020, over recovered

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
wholesale fuel costs totaled approximately $10 million and were included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's
balance sheet and over recovered regulatory clause liabilities on Mississippi Power's balance sheet.
Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance
with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on
Mississippi Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.
Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment
Mississippi Power establishes annually an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC to collect the
ad valorem taxes paid by Mississippi Power. In 2020 and 2019, the annual revenues collected through the ad valorem tax
adjustment factor increased by $10 million and decreased by $2 million, respectively. On April 6, 2021, the Mississippi PSC
approved Mississippi Power's annual ad valorem tax adjustment filing for 2021, which requested an annual increase in revenues of
approximately $28 million, including approximately $19 million of ad valorem taxes previously recovered through PEP in
accordance with the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement. The rate increase became effective with the first billing
cycle of May 2021.
System Restoration Rider
Mississippi Power carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and general property. However,
Mississippi Power is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured casualty damage to its property, including
transmission and distribution facilities. As permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, Mississippi Power accrues for the cost
of such damage through an annual expense accrual which is credited to regulatory liability accounts for the retail and wholesale
jurisdictions. The cost of repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed $50,000 is charged to the
reserve. Every year, the Mississippi PSC, the MPUS, and Mississippi Power agree on SRR revenue level(s).
Mississippi Power's net retail SRR accrual, which includes carrying costs and amortization of related excess deferred income tax
benefits, was $(1.8) million in 2021, $0.8 million 2020, and $1.4 million in 2019. At December 31, 2020, the retail property
damage reserve balance was $4 million. On October 14, 2021, the Mississippi PSC issued an accounting order giving Mississippi
Power the authority to reclassify the retail costs associated with Hurricanes Zeta and Ida (approximately $49 million) to a
regulatory asset to be recovered through PEP over a period to be determined in Mississippi Power's 2022 PEP proceeding. At
December 31, 2021, the retail property damage reserve balance was $31 million, which reflects the impact of the reclassification.
On December 7, 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which requested an increase in retail
revenues of approximately $9 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of March 2022. The Mississippi PSC also
established $8 million as the minimum annual accrual amount until a target property damage reserve balance of $75 million is met.
In the event the expected annual charges exceed the annual accrual or the target balance has been met, Mississippi Power and the
Mississippi PSC will determine the appropriate change to the annual accrual. Additionally, if PEP earnings are above a certain
threshold, Mississippi Power has the ability to apply any required PEP refund as an additional accrual to the property damage
reserve in lieu of customer refunds.
Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff
Mississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the
City of Collins, all located in southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term, cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff.
In 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed, and the FERC accepted, a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part
of the MRA tariff, under which Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy share in providing electricity to the Cooperative Energy
delivery points under the tariff. The SSA may be cancelled by Cooperative Energy with 10 years notice. Cooperative Energy has
the option to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually, with required
notice, with a remaining total reduction of 8%, or approximately $8 million in cumulative annual base revenues.
In June 2020, the FERC accepted Mississippi Power's requested $2 million annual increase in MRA base rates effective June 1,
2020, as agreed upon in a settlement agreement reached with its wholesale customers.
Southern Company Gas
Utility Regulation and Rate Design
The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates
charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These
II-160
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a
return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based
primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed
charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta
Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer
consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer
demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas
has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit
exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility,
allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation,
energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer
service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception of
Chattanooga Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes
encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by
customers. See "Rate Proceedings" herein for additional information. Also see "Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital
Projects" herein for additional information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural gas distribution
utilities.

Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects
In addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and
Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure
replacement programs. Total capital expenditures incurred during 2021 for gas distribution operations were $1.5 billion.

Nicor Gas
Illinois legislation allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system and
stipulates that rate increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average
of 4.0% or, in any given year, 5.5% of base rate revenues. In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the nine-year regulatory
infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. In accordance with orders from the Illinois Commission,
Nicor Gas recovers program costs incurred through a separate rider and base rates. The Illinois Commission's approval of Nicor
Gas' rate case on November 18, 2021 included recovery of program costs through December 31, 2021. See "Rate Proceedings –
Nicor Gas" herein for additional information. Nicor Gas' capital expenditures related to qualifying projects under the Investing in
Illinois program totaled $389 million and $396 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Virginia Natural Gas
In 2019, the Virginia Commission approved amendments to and extension of the Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE)
program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program. The extension allows Virginia Natural Gas to continue replacing aging
pipeline infrastructure through 2024 and increases its authorized investment under the previously-approved plan from $35 million
to $40 million in 2019 with additional annual investments of $50 million in 2020, $60 million in 2021, $70 million in each year
from 2022 through 2024, and a total potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a maximum total
investment over the six-year term (2019 through 2024) of $365 million. Virginia Natural Gas' capital expenditures under the SAVE
program totaled $49 million and $45 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In accordance with the base rate case approved by the
Virginia Commission in 2021, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to November 1, 2020 through base
rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to November 1, 2020 are currently being recovered through a separate rider and are
subject to future base rate case proceedings.
Atlanta Gas Light
In 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the continuation of GRAM as part of Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order. Various
infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program
to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system
and LNG facilities in Georgia, continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments are
included in annual base rate adjustments. The amounts to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs have
been recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. These allowed costs are
primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the infrastructure programs in place prior to GRAM and are being
recovered through GRAM and base rates until the earlier of the full recovery of the related under recovered amount or December
31, 2025. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2021 was $91 million, including $47 million of unrecognized equity
return. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See "Unrecognized Ratemaking
Amounts" herein for additional information.(*)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to
extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in
Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by
the Georgia PSC.
See "Rate Proceedings – Atlanta Gas Light" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021
approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new
System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to
recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.
Chattanooga Gas
In June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace
approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million,
which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.
Natural Gas Cost Recovery
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in
the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost
of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas
distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue
earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through
adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are
reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern
Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use
customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural
gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At
December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under
recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern
Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other
regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.
Rate Proceedings
Nicor Gas
In 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate
increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a
ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a
revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.
On November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021.
The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and
was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.
Atlanta Gas Light
In 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25%
and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings
above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously
authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited
to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate
adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates.
The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.
In July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of
$37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation
established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case
order.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
On February 16, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a
long-range comprehensive planning process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light was required to develop and file
at least triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each i-CDP will include a 10-year forecast of interstate and
intrastate capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the first three years consistent with Atlanta Gas Light's current
capacity supply plan, and a 10-year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the
related revenue requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for
authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects.
On April 28, 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first i-CDP with the Georgia PSC, which includes a series of ongoing and proposed
pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next 10 years (2022 through 2031), as well as the required capital
investments and related costs to implement the programs. The i-CDP reflected capital investments totaling approximately
$0.5 billion to $0.6 billion annually.
On November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an October 14, 2021 joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and
the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its
combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, or $5 million
for 2022. The stipulation agreement also provides for $1.7 billion of total capital investment for the years 2022 through 2024.
Also on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an
annual rate increase of $43 million effective January 1, 2022.
Virginia Natural Gas
On September 14, 2021, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation agreement related to Virginia Natural Gas' June 2020
general rate case filing, which allows for a $43 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $14 million related to the
recovery of investments under the SAVE program, based on a ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 51.9%. Interim rate adjustments
became effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an increase of
approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were
completed during the fourth quarter 2021.
Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs
As discussed under "Utility Regulation and Rate Design," the natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms
to recover bad debt expense, which helped mitigate potential increases in bad debt expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Deferred incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic were immaterial for Virginia Natural Gas.
Atlanta Gas Light
In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Atlanta Gas Light to continue its
previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections. In June 2020, the Georgia PSC ordered Atlanta Gas Light to resume
customer disconnections beginning July 2020, with exceptions for customers still covered by a shelter-in-place order. All
suspensions for customer disconnections were lifted in October 2020. The orders provide the Marketers, including SouthStar, with
a mechanism to receive credits from Atlanta Gas Light for the base rates it charged to the Marketers of non-paying customers
during the suspension. Atlanta Gas Light will begin recovering these credits through GRAM rates effective January 1, 2023.
Nicor Gas
In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Illinois Commission issued an order directing utilities to cease
disconnections for non-payment and to suspend the imposition of late payment fees or penalties. In June 2020, the Illinois
Commission approved a stipulation pursuant to which Nicor Gas and other utilities in Illinois would provide more flexible credit
and collection procedures to assist customers with financial hardship and which authorizes a special purpose rider for recovery of
the following COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts: incremental costs directly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the
offset for COVID-19 pandemic-related credits received, foregone late fees, foregone reconnection charges, and the costs associated
with a bill payment assistance program. Nicor Gas resumed late payment fees in July 2020 and, on October 1, 2020, began
recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts through the special purpose rider, which will continue over a 24-month
period. On March 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a phased-in schedule for disconnections related to non-payment.
Nicor Gas began certain disconnections in late April 2021 and resumed normal disconnections in June 2021. At December 31, 2021
and 2020, Nicor Gas' related regulatory asset was $5 million and $9 million, respectively.

General Litigation Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory matters. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation or regulatory matters against each Registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time; however,
for current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising
from such current proceedings would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements.
The Registrants believe the pending legal challenges discussed below have no merit; however, the ultimate outcome of these
matters cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Company
In February 2017, Jean Vineyard and Judy Mesirov each filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. Each of these lawsuits names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its
current and former officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. In 2017, these two shareholder derivative lawsuits were
consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaints allege that the defendants caused
Southern Company to make false or misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility cost and schedule. Further,
the complaints allege that the defendants were unjustly enriched and caused the waste of corporate assets and also allege that the
individual defendants violated their fiduciary duties.
In May 2017, Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County,
Georgia that names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its current and former officers, and certain
former Mississippi Power officers. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants, among other things, breached their
fiduciary duties in connection with schedule delays and cost overruns associated with the construction of the Kemper County
energy facility. The complaint further alleges that the individual defendants authorized or failed to correct false and misleading
statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility schedule and cost and failed to implement necessary internal controls to
prevent harm to Southern Company. In August 2019, the court granted a motion filed by the plaintiff in July 2019 to substitute a
new named plaintiff, Martin J. Kobuck, in place of Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust.
The plaintiffs in each of these cases seek to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and, on each
plaintiff's own behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. The plaintiffs also seek certain changes to Southern
Company's corporate governance and internal processes. On January 21, 2022, the plaintiffs in the federal court action filed a
motion for preliminary approval of settlement, together with an executed stipulation of settlement, which applies to both the federal
and state actions. The terms of the settlement are not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's financial
statements.
Georgia Power
In 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative class action against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia alleging that
Georgia Power's collection in rates of amounts for municipal franchise fees (which fees are paid to municipalities) exceeded the
amounts allowed in orders of the Georgia PSC and alleging certain state law claims. This case has been ruled upon and appealed
numerous times over the last several years. In October 2019, the Georgia PSC issued an order that found Georgia Power

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
has appropriately implemented the municipal franchise fee schedule. On March 16, 2021, the Superior Court of Fulton County
granted class certification and Georgia Power's motion for summary judgment. On March 22, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal, and, on April 2, 2021, Georgia Power filed a notice of cross appeal on the issue of class certification. On December 1, 2021,
the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior Court's ruling that granted summary judgment to Georgia Power and dismissed
Georgia Power's cross appeal on the issue of class certification as moot. On December 21, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a petition for
writ of certiorari to the Georgia Supreme Court. The amount of any possible losses cannot be estimated at this time because, among
other factors, it is unknown whether any losses would be subject to recovery from any municipalities.
In July 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia against Georgia
Power alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater, surface water, and air, resulting in alleged personal
injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages, a
medical monitoring fund, and injunctive relief. Georgia Power has filed multiple motions to dismiss the complaint. On October 8,
2021, three additional complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that
releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries and property damage. The
plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages. On November 11, 2021, Georgia Power
filed a notice to remove the three cases pending in the Superior Court of Monroe County to the U.S. District Court in the Middle
District of Georgia. On February 7, 2022, four additional complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia
against Georgia Power seeking damages for alleged personal injuries or property damage. The amount of any possible losses from
these matters cannot be estimated at this time.
Mississippi Power
In 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the
three then-serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was
amended in March 2019 to include four additional plaintiffs. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to
charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC
prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi
Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the
initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and
intentional wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to $23.5 million in the refund process
by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual
damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The district court dismissed
the amended complaint; however, in March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of the Mississippi
PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against all
defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for
leave to file a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the proposed second amended complaint, as
well as several additional state law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to disclose the annual percentage
rate of interest applicable to refunds. In November 2020, the court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending motions and entered final
judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. On January 22, 2021, the court denied further motions by the plaintiffs to vacate the
judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. On February 19, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. An adverse outcome in this proceeding could have a material impact on Mississippi
Power's financial statements.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of
waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur
substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities
conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known
impacted sites in the financial statements. A liability for environmental remediation costs is recognized only when a loss is
determined to be probable and reasonably estimable and is reduced as expenditures are incurred. The traditional electric operating
companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have each received authority from their respective state
PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory
mechanisms. Any difference between the liabilities accrued and costs recovered through rates is deferred as a regulatory asset or
liability. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other
applicable state regulatory agencies.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site
Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and assessment and
potential cleanup of such sites is expected. For 2021, 2020, and 2019, Georgia Power recovered approximately $12 million, $12
million, and $2 million, respectively, through the ECCR tariff for environmental remediation.
Southern Company Gas is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with 40 former MGP sites in four different
states. Southern Company Gas' accrued environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was based on the
estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with these sites.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the environmental remediation liability and the balance of under recovered environmental
remediation costs were reflected in the balance sheets of Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern Company Gas as shown
in the table below. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Alabama Power did not have environmental remediation liabilities and
Mississippi Power's balance was immaterial.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of the regulatory treatment for
environmental remediation expenses described above, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material
impact on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
Acting through the DOE and pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. government entered into contracts with
Alabama Power and Georgia Power that required the DOE to dispose of spent nuclear fuel generated at Plants Farley, Hatch, and
Vogtle Units 1 and 2 beginning no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE has yet to commence the performance of its contractual
and statutory obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Consequently, Alabama Power and Georgia Power pursued and continue to
pursue legal remedies against the U.S. government for its partial breach of contract.
In 2014, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed lawsuits against the U.S. government for the costs of continuing to store spent
nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. The
damage period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2014. In 2019, the Court of Federal Claims granted Alabama Power's
and Georgia Power's motion for summary judgment on damages not disputed by the U.S. government, awarding those undisputed
damages to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. However, those undisputed damages are not collectible until the court enters final
judgment on the remaining damages.
In 2017, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed additional lawsuits against the U.S. government in the Court of Federal Claims
for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. In August 2020, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed amended complaints in each of the
lawsuits adding damages from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 to the claim period.
The outstanding claims for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019 total $110 million and $132 million for Alabama
Power and Georgia Power (based on its ownership interests), respectively. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is
resolved, the U.S. government disposes of Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's spent nuclear fuel pursuant to its contractual
obligations, or alternative storage is otherwise provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial statements as of
December 31, 2021 for any potential recoveries from the pending lawsuits.
The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect to credit
any recoveries for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from their respective PSC; therefore, no material impact on
Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income is expected.
On-site dry spent fuel storage facilities are operational at all three plants and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through
the expected life of each plant.
Nuclear Insurance
Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements of indemnity with the
NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies'
nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $13.5 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear
incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $450 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI),
with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear
incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $138 million per incident for each
licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $20 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor.
Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its
ownership and buyback interests in all licensed reactors, is $275 million and $267 million, respectively, per incident, but not more
than an aggregate of $41 million and $40 million, respectively, to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum
assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years. The next scheduled
adjustment is due no later than November 1, 2023. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information on
joint ownership agreements.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to
provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $1.5 billion for members' operating nuclear generating facilities.
Additionally, both companies have NEIL policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature
decommissioning coverage up to $1.25 billion for nuclear losses and policies providing coverage up to $750 million for non-
nuclear losses in excess of the $1.5 billion primary coverage.
NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage
at a member's nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a
maximum per occurrence per unit limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase limits based on
the projected full cost of replacement power, subject to ownership limitations, and have each elected a 12-week deductible waiting
period for each nuclear plant.
A builders' risk property insurance policy has been purchased from NEIL for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This
policy provides the Vogtle Owners up to $2.75 billion for accidental property damage occurring during construction.
Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments each year if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to
the insurer. The maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power as of December 31, 2021 under the NEIL
policies would be $52 million and $83 million, respectively.
Claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to normal policy
limits). The maximum aggregate that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events in any 12-month
period is $3.2 billion each, plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.
For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such
policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any
remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the NRC,
and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the applicable company or to its debt trustees as may be appropriate
under the policies and applicable trust indentures. In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to
cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not

recovered from customers, would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, and could have a material effect on
Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, and Georgia Power's financial condition and results of operations.
All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable state
premium taxes.
Other Matters
Mississippi Power
Kemper County Energy Facility
In 2019, 2020, and 2021, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income associated with abandonment and related closure costs and
ongoing period costs, net of salvage proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. These
charges, including related tax impacts, totaled $24 million pre-tax and after tax in 2019, $4 million pre-tax ($3 million after tax) in
2020, and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after tax) in 2021. The pre-tax charges are included in other operations and maintenance
expenses on the statements of income.
Dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities are expected to be completed by 2026.
Additional pre-tax period costs associated with dismantlement and site restoration activities, including related costs for compliance
and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes, net of salvage, are estimated to total $10 million to $20 million annually through
2025.
Mississippi Power owns the lignite mine located around the Kemper County energy facility site. As a result of the abandonment of
the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to
continue through 2028.
As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation,
has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation
activities. See Note 6 for additional information.
In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $270 million of the Kemper County energy facility
through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. In 2016, additional DOE
grants in the amount of $137 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the
DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the $387 million of total grants received. In
September 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's
request, which enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site
restoration activities. The expected impact of the closeout agreement was accrued in 2019. In connection with the DOE closeout
discussions, in 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of an
investigation related to the grants received. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could
have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.
Plant Daniel
In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, NextEra Energy held back $75 million of the purchase price pending
Mississippi Power and Gulf Power negotiating a mutually acceptable revised operating agreement for Plant Daniel. In addition,
Mississippi Power and Gulf Power agreed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in the Plant Daniel
coal units such that each of them would, after the restructuring, own 100% of a generating unit. In 2019, Gulf Power provided
notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the coal generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15,
2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that
Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential
operational and economic effects of Gulf Power's notice. Mississippi Power and Gulf Power are continuing negotiations on a
mutually acceptable revised operating agreement. The impacts of operating the units on an individual basis continue to be evaluated
by Mississippi Power and any transfer of ownership would be subject to approval by the FERC and the Mississippi PSC. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 under "Mississippi Power – Integrated Resource
Plan" for additional information on Plant Daniel and Note 15 under "Southern Company" for information regarding the sale of Gulf
Power.
Commitments
To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the Southern Company system's electric generating plants, the Southern Company
system has entered into various long-term commitments not recognized on the balance sheets for the procurement and delivery of
II-169

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
fossil fuel and, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, nuclear fuel. The majority of the Registrants' fuel expense for the periods
presented was purchased under long-term commitments. Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its future fuel needs
will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.
Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of
Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether
or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2
investment relate to costs in excess of Georgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these
portions at the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in
Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power, non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income.
Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $6 million, $5 million, and $6 million in 2021, 2020, and
2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $42
million, consisting of $4 million for 2022, $3 million annually for 2023 through 2025, $1 million for 2026, and $28 million
thereafter.
See Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.
Southern Company Gas has commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply, including charges recoverable

Guarantees
SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power may be jointly and severally liable. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements with
each of the traditional electric operating companies to ensure they will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses,
liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these agreements.
Alabama Power has guaranteed a $100 million principal amount long-term bank loan SEGCO entered into in 2018 and
subsequently extended in 2021. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the portion of such obligation
corresponding to Georgia Power's proportionate ownership of SEGCO's stock if Alabama Power is called upon to make such
payment under its guarantee. At December 31, 2021, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $82 million of equity and $100
million of long-term debt that matures in November 2024, on which the annual interest requirement is derived from a variable rate
index. In addition, SEGCO had short-term debt outstanding of $20 million. See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for additional information.
As discussed in Note 9, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees related to railcar
leases.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Georgia Power had contract assets primarily related to retail customer fixed bill programs, where
the payment is contingent upon Georgia Power's continued performance and the customer's continued participation in the program
over a one-year contract term, and unregulated service agreements, where payment is contingent on project completion. Contract
liabilities for Georgia Power relate to cash collections recognized in advance of revenue for unregulated service agreements.
Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business had contract assets of $50 million and $81 million at
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and contract liabilities of $39 million and $27 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, for outstanding performance obligations.
Revenues recognized in 2021 and 2020, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
respectively, were $29 million and $33 million, respectively, for Southern Company and immaterial for the other Registrants.
Remaining Performance Obligations
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have long-term contracts with customers in which revenues are
recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over the contract term. These contracts primarily relate to PPAs whereby the
traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power provide electricity and generation capacity to a customer. The revenue
recognized for the delivery of electricity is variable; however, certain PPAs include a fixed payment for fixed generation capacity
over the term of the contract. Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business also has partially satisfied
performance obligations related to certain fixed price contracts. Revenues from contracts with customers related to these
performance obligations remaining at December 31, 2021 are expected to be recognized as follows:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and
replacement of minor items of property is charged to other operations and maintenance expenses as incurred or performed with the
exception of nuclear refueling costs and certain maintenance costs including those described below.
In accordance with orders from their respective state PSCs, Alabama Power and Georgia Power defer nuclear refueling outage
operations and maintenance expenses to a regulatory asset when the charges are incurred. Alabama Power amortizes the costs over
a subsequent 18-month period with Plant Farley's fall outage cost amortization beginning in January of the following year and
spring outage cost amortization beginning in July of the same year. Georgia Power amortizes its costs over each unit's operating
cycle, or 18 months for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and 24 months for Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power's amortization
period begins the month the refueling outage starts.

A portion of Mississippi Power's railway track maintenance costs is charged to fuel stock and recovered through Mississippi
Power's fuel clause.
The portion of Southern Company Gas' non-working gas used to maintain the structural integrity of natural gas storage facilities
that is considered to be non-recoverable is depreciated, while the recoverable or retained portion is not depreciated.
See Note 9 for information on finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, net, which are included in property, plant, and equipment.
The Registrants have deferred certain implementation costs related to cloud hosting arrangements. Once a hosted software is placed
into service, the related deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected hosting arrangement term,
including any renewal options that are reasonably certain of exercise. The amortization is reflected with the associated cloud
hosting fees, which are generally reflected in other operations and maintenance expenses on the Registrants' statements of income.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred cloud implementation costs, which are generally included in other deferred charges and
assets on the Registrants' balance sheets, are as follows:

Depreciation and Amortization
The traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service
is provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates. The approximate rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:
2021 2020 2019
Alabama Power 2.7 % 2.6 % 3.1 %
Georgia Power 3.3 % 3.0 % 2.6 %
Mississippi Power 3.6 % 3.7 % 3.7 %
Southern Company Gas 2.8 % 2.8 % 2.9 %
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are filed with the respective state PSC
and/or other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas
distribution utilities. During 2020, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Atlanta Gas Light revised their depreciation rates in
accordance with base rate case approvals by their respective PSCs. The revised rates were effective January 1, 2020 for Georgia
Power and Atlanta Gas Light and April 1, 2020 for Mississippi Power. See Note 2 for additional information.
When property, plant, and equipment subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other
property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet accounts, and a gain or
loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the asset are retired when the related property unit is
retired.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, accumulated depreciation for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas consisted of utility
plant in service totaling $33.1 billion and $31.6 billion, respectively, for Southern Company and $4.8 billion and $4.6 billion,
respectively, for Southern Company Gas, as well as other plant in service totaling $930 million and $817 million, respectively, for
Southern Company and $219 million and $195 million, respectively, for Southern Company Gas. Other plant in service includes
the non-utility assets of Southern Company Gas, as well as, for Southern Company, certain other non-utility subsidiaries.
Depreciation of the original cost of other plant in service is provided primarily on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.
Useful lives for Southern Company Gas's non-utility assets range from five to 12 years for transportation equipment, 30 to 75 years
for storage facilities, and up to 75 years for other assets. Useful lives for the assets of Southern Company's other non-utility
subsidiaries range up to 37 years.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Southern Power
Southern Power applies component depreciation, where depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of the asset. Certain of Southern Power's generation assets related to natural gas-fired facilities are depreciated
on a units-of-production basis, using hours or starts, to better match outage and maintenance costs to the usage of, and revenues
from, these assets. The primary assets in Southern Power's property, plant, and equipment are generating facilities, which generally
have estimated useful lives as follows:
Southern Power Generating Facility Useful life
Natural gas Up to 50 years
Solar Up to 35 years
Wind Up to 30 years
When Southern Power's depreciable property, plant, and equipment is retired, or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed and a gain or loss is recognized in the statements of income.
Southern Power reviews its estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could result
in changes which could have a material impact on Southern Power's net income.

which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of
future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the
timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future
removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance
from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for
long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations
are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as
regulatory assets.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule
and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations
related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See "Nuclear Decommissioning" herein for additional information. Other significant
AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum
cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind
facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as
obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term
assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these
assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is
indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these
retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the
ARO.
Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of
income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance
with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as
either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
During 2020, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling approximately $501 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the
related state rule primarily as a result of management's completion of the closure design for the remaining ash pond and the
addition of a water treatment system to the design of another ash pond. The additional estimated costs to close these ash ponds
under the planned closure-in-place methodology primarily relate to inputs from contractor bids, design revisions, and changes in
the expected volume of ash handling. During 2021, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling approximately $406 million to its
AROs primarily related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule based on updated estimates for post-closure costs at its ash ponds
and inflation rates.
During the third quarter 2020, Georgia Power refined the cost estimates related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its
generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule, including updates to long-term post-closure care
requirements, market pricing, and timing of future cash outlays and recorded an increase of approximately $411 million to its AROs
related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In September 2021, Georgia Power recorded a further increase of approximately
$435 million to these AROs based on updated estimates for inflation rates and the timing of closure activities.
In September 2021, Mississippi Power recorded an increase of approximately $31 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule
based on updated estimates for the timing of closure activities, post-closure costs at one of its ash ponds, and inflation rates.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2021 using various
assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential
methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have
periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR
unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates
may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by
environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash
flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted.
See Note 2 under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time.
Nuclear Decommissioning
The NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds
for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's
regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the
IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers,
neither Southern Company nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to
mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated third-
party managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers are authorized,
within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on
the Funds' investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities
and are reported as trading securities.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power record the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note 13, as
management believes that fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, are
recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs in the balance sheets and are not included in net income or OCI. Fair value
adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.
The Funds at Georgia Power participate in a securities lending program through the managers of the Funds. Under this program,
Georgia Power's Funds' investment securities are loaned to institutional investors for a fee. Securities loaned are fully collateralized
by cash, letters of credit, and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately $42 million and $44 million, respectively, of the fair market value of Georgia Power's
Funds' securities were on loan and pledged to creditors under the Funds' managers' securities lending program. The fair value of the
collateral received was approximately $43 million and $45 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and can only be
sold by the borrower upon the return of the loaned securities. The collateral received is treated as a non-cash item in the statements
of cash flows.

The investment securities held in the Funds continue to be managed with a long-term focus. Accordingly, all purchases and sales
within the Funds are presented separately in the statements of cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the nature of the
securities and purpose for which the securities were acquired.
For Alabama Power, approximately $15 million at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020 previously recorded in internal reserves is
being transferred into the Funds through 2040 as approved by the Alabama PSC. The NRC's minimum external funding
requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on
the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time,
the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

Total $ 1,217 $ 1,145 
Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The decommissioning cost estimates are
based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from these
estimates because of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the
assumptions used in making these estimates. The estimated costs of decommissioning at December 31, 2021 based on the most
current studies, which were performed in 2018 for Alabama Power and in 2021 for Georgia Power, were as follows:

Non-radiated structures 99 61 85 
Total site study costs $ 1,720 $ 1,018 $ 883 
(*)Based on Georgia Power's ownership interests.
For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power's decommissioning costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power's
decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities and the site
study estimate for spent fuel management as of 2021. Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an
estimated inflation rate of 4.5% and 2.5% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and an estimated trust earnings rate
of 7.0% and 4.5% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively.
Amounts previously contributed to the Funds for Plant Farley are currently projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning
obligations. Alabama Power will continue to provide site-specific estimates of the decommissioning costs and related projections of
funds in the external trust to the Alabama PSC and, if necessary, would seek the Alabama PSC's approval to address any changes in
a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements.
Effective January 1, 2020, in connection with the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is a
total of $4 million for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking in
2019 totaled $5 million.
7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. If a venture is a VIE for which a Registrant
is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the
conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.(*) (*)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
For entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the
investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are
consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the
balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity
method investments in the statements of income. See "SEGCO" and "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.
SEGCO
Alabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating
units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Alabama Power and Georgia Power
account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally
to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating
expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the
statements of income totaled $75 million in 2021, $67 million in 2020, and $93 million in 2019 for Alabama Power and $77 million
in 2021, $69 million in 2020, and $95 million in 2019 for Georgia Power.
SEGCO paid dividends of $14 million in 2021, $12 million in 2020, and $14 million in 2019, one half of which were paid to each
of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net
income.
Alabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership
agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the
remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.
See Note 3 under "Guarantees" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to
SEGCO.
Southern Power
Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of
these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets,
and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.
SP Solar and SP Wind
In 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% limited partnership interest in SP Solar to Global Atlantic Financial Group
Limited (Global Atlantic). A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest
in SP Solar and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns the remaining 66% ownership in SP Solar. SP Solar
qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the 33% limited partner does not have
substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, SP Solar had total assets of $6.1 billion, total liabilities of $408 million and $387 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and
33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership
agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such
available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of
appropriate operating reserves.
In 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind to three financial investors. Southern Power owns
100% of the Class B membership interests and the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP
Wind qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not
have substantive kick-out rights against Southern Power.
II-183

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, SP Wind had total assets of $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $130
million and $138 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $41 million and $43 million, respectively. Under the terms of
the limited liability agreement, distributions without Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated
to distribute all such available cash to its members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to
the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated 60% to Southern Power
and 40% to the three financial investors in accordance with the limited liability agreement.
Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities
of each entity, including operating and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to
partner consent and the liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working
capital items and do not include any long-term debt.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax
equity investors or acquired less than a 100% interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the
arrangements are structured similar to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling members do not have substantive kick-out
rights.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the other VIEs had total assets of $1.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, total liabilities of
$263 million and $110 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $886 million and $454 million, respectively. Under the
terms of the partnership agreements, distributions of all available cash are required each month or quarter and additional
distributions require partner consent.
Equity Method Investments
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Southern Power had equity method investments in wind and battery energy storage projects
totaling $86 million and $19 million, respectively. Earnings (loss) from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, Southern Power sold an equity method investment in a wind project and received proceeds of
$31 million. The gain associated with the transaction was immaterial.
Southern Company Gas
Equity Method Investments
The carrying amounts of Southern Company Gas' equity method investments at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and related earnings
(loss) from those investments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:

PennEast Pipeline Project
In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a partnership in which it holds a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline, an
interstate pipeline company formed to develop and operate an approximate 118-mile natural gas pipeline between New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
In 2019, an appellate court ruled that the PennEast Pipeline does not have federal eminent domain authority over lands in which a
state has property rights interests. On June 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PennEast Pipeline following a
review of the appellate court decision. Southern Company Gas assesses its equity method investments for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment may be impaired. Following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, during
the second quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas management reassessed the project construction timing, including the anticipated
timing for receipt of a FERC certificate and all remaining state and local permits, as well as potential challenges thereto, and
performed an impairment analysis. The outcome of the analysis resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $82 million ($58 million
after tax).
On September 27, 2021, PennEast Pipeline announced that further development of the project is no longer supported, and, as a
result, all further development of the project has ceased. During the third quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded an
additional pre-tax charge of $2 million ($2 million after tax) related to its share of the project level impairment, as well as
$7 million of additional tax expense, resulting in total pre-tax charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) during 2021 related to
the project.(a)(b)

authorities. The traditional electric operating companies are required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet principal and interest requirements
of such bonds. Proceeds from certain issuances are restricted until qualifying expenditures are incurred.

investments and preferred security sales were loaned back to Alabama Power through the issuance of junior subordinated notes, which Alabama Power
redeemed during 2021. The junior subordinated notes constituted substantially all of the assets of this trust. Alabama Power considered the mechanisms and
obligations relating to the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constituted a full and unconditional guarantee by it of the trust's payment
obligations with respect to these securities. See Note 1 under "Variable Interest Entities" for additional information on the accounting treatment for this trust and

DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings
Pursuant to the loan guarantee program established under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Title XVII Loan Guarantee
Program), Georgia Power and the DOE entered into a loan guarantee agreement in 2014 and the Amended and Restated Loan
Guarantee Agreement in March 2019. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee
the obligations of Georgia Power under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, Georgia Power was authorized
to make term loan borrowings through the FFB in an amount up to approximately $5.130 billion, provided that total aggregate
borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities could not exceed 70% of (i) Eligible Project Costs minus (ii) approximately $1.492
billion (reflecting the amounts received by Georgia Power under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement less the related customer
refunds).
In June 2021 and December 2021, Georgia Power made the final borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities in aggregate principal
amounts of $371 million and $69 million, respectively, at an interest rate of 2.434% and 2.178%, respectively, through the final
maturity date of February 20, 2044. No further borrowings are permitted under the FFB Credit Facilities. During 2021, Georgia
Power made principal amortization payments of $96 million under the FFB Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020,
Georgia Power had $5.0 billion and $4.6 billion of borrowings outstanding under the FFB Credit Facilities, respectively.
All borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities are full recourse to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power is obligated to reimburse the
DOE for any payments the DOE is required to make to the FFB under its guarantee. Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to
the DOE are full recourse and secured by a first priority lien on (i) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4 (primarily the units under construction, the related real property, and any nuclear fuel loaded in the reactor core) and
(ii) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. There are no
restrictions on Georgia Power's ability to grant liens on other property.
The final maturity date for each advance under the FFB Credit Facilities is February 20, 2044. Interest is payable quarterly and
principal payments began in February 2020. Each borrowing under the FFB Credit Facilities bears interest at a fixed rate equal to
the applicable U.S. Treasury rate at the time of the borrowing plus a spread equal to 0.375%.
Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, Georgia Power is subject to customary borrower affirmative and
negative covenants and events of default. In addition, Georgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other
project-specific covenants and events of default.
In the event certain mandatory prepayment events occur, Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal
amount of all borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years (with level principal amortization). Among
other things, these mandatory prepayment events include (i) the termination of the Vogtle Services Agreement or rejection of the
Vogtle Services Agreement in any Westinghouse bankruptcy if Georgia Power does not maintain access to intellectual property
rights under the related intellectual property licenses; (ii) termination of the Bechtel Agreement, unless the Vogtle Owners enter into
a replacement agreement; (iii) cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the Georgia PSC or by Georgia Power; (iv) failure of
the holders of 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to vote to continue construction following certain
schedule extensions; (v) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on completion of(a) (b) (c)

Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities; or (vi)
loss of or failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from
an event of taking must be applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Georgia Power
also may voluntarily prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, any
prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) will be made with a make-whole premium or discount, as applicable.
The latest extension of the schedule for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the
ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction. If the holders of at least 90% of the ownership
interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all
outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years.
In connection with any cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the DOE may elect to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4. In such an event, the DOE will have the right to assume Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal
agreements relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and to acquire all or a portion of Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
See Note 2 under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Secured Debt
Each of Southern Company's subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from Southern Company and its other
subsidiaries. There are no agreements or other arrangements among the Southern Company system companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of Southern Company or any of its
other subsidiaries.
As discussed under "Long-term Debt" herein, the Registrants had secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Each
Registrant's senior notes, junior subordinated notes, pollution control and other revenue bond obligations, bank term loans, credit
facility borrowings, and notes payable are effectively subordinated to all secured debt of each respective Registrant.
Equity Units
In 2019, Southern Company issued 34.5 million 2019 Series A Equity Units (Equity Units), initially in the form of corporate units
(Corporate Units), at a stated amount of $50 per Corporate Unit, for a total stated amount of $1.725 billion. Net proceeds from the
issuance were approximately $1.682 billion. The proceeds were used to repay short-term indebtedness and for other general
corporate purposes, including investments in Southern Company's subsidiaries.
Each Corporate Unit is comprised of (i) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of Southern
Company's Series 2019A Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes (Series 2019A RSNs) due 2024, (ii) a 1/40 undivided beneficial
ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of Southern Company's Series 2019B Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes
(together with the Series 2019A RSNs, the RSNs) due 2027, and (iii) a stock purchase contract, which obligates the holder to
purchase from Southern Company, no later than August 1, 2022, a certain number of shares of Southern Company's common stock
for $50 in cash (Stock Purchase Contract). Southern Company has agreed to remarket the RSNs in 2022, at which time each
interest rate on the RSNs will reset at the applicable market rate. Holders may choose to either remarket their RSNs, receive the
proceeds, and use those funds to settle the related Stock Purchase Contract or retain the RSNs and use other funds to settle the
related Stock Purchase Contract. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, holders will have the right to put their RSNs to Southern
Company at a price equal to the principal amount. The Corporate Units carry an annual distribution rate of 6.75% of the stated
amount, which is comprised of a quarterly interest payment on the RSNs of 2.70% per year and a quarterly purchase contract
adjustment payment of 4.05% per year.
Each Stock Purchase Contract obligates the holder to purchase, and Southern Company to sell, for $50 a number of shares of
Southern Company common stock determined based on the applicable market value (as determined under the related Stock
Purchase Contract) in accordance with the conversion ratios set forth below (subject to anti-dilution adjustments):
•If the applicable market value is equal to or greater than $68.64, 0.7284 shares.
•If the applicable market value is less than $68.64 but greater than $57.20, a number of shares equal to $50 divided by the
applicable market value.
•If the applicable market value is less than or equal to $57.20, 0.8741 shares.
A holder's ownership interest in the RSNs is pledged to Southern Company to secure the holder's obligation under the related Stock
Purchase Contract. If a holder of a Stock Purchase Contract chooses at any time to have its RSNs released from the pledge, such
holder's obligation under such Stock Purchase Contract must be secured by a U.S. Treasury security equal to the aggregate principal
amount of the RSNs. At the time of issuance, the RSNs were recorded on Southern Company's consolidated balance

sheet as long-term debt and the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $198 million was recorded as a liability,
representing the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, with an offsetting reduction to paid-in capital. The liability
balance at December 31, 2021 was $52 million, which was classified as current. The difference between the face value and present
value of the contract adjustment payments is being accreted to interest expense on the consolidated statements of income over the
three-year period ending in August 2022. The liability recorded for the contract adjustment payments is considered non-cash and
excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. To settle the Stock Purchase Contracts, Southern Company will be
required to issue a maximum of 30.2 million shares of common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments and a make-whole
adjustment if certain fundamental changes occur).

At December 31, 2021, committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows:

which $8 million and $4 million, respectively, was unused at December 31, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, Southern Power amended its $60 million
letter of credit facility, which, among other things, extended the expiration date from 2023 to 2025 and increased the amount to $75 million. Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b)Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $800 million of the
arrangement expiring in 2026 and all $250 million of the arrangement expiring in 2022. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2026
also includes $700 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to the multi-year credit
arrangement expiring in 2026, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted. See "Structural Considerations" herein
for additional information.
The bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment
fees average less than /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and
its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith,
Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments
thereunder.
These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain
covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration or, in the case of Southern Power, cross-default provisions to other
indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such cross-
default provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Southern Power defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee
obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if
the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Southern
Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined
in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total
capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt excludes junior subordinated notes and, in
certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these
definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-
recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2021, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit
arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.(a)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric
operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate
revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2021 was
approximately $1.5 billion (comprised of approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $672 million at Georgia Power, and $34
million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2021, Georgia Power had approximately $157 million of fixed rate
revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months.
At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, Southern Power had $105 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements,
which is included in other deferred charges and assets on Southern Power's consolidated balance sheets.
Notes Payable
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the
liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above under "Bank Credit Arrangements." Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not parties or obligors to its commercial paper program. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper
programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and at Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports working capital
needs at Nicor Gas as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of Southern Company Gas' other
subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program. See "Structural Considerations" herein for
additional information.
In addition, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various bank term loan agreements. Unless
otherwise stated, the proceeds of these loans were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including
working capital and, for the subsidiaries, their continuous construction programs.
Commercial paper and short-term bank term loans are included in notes payable in the balance sheets. Details of short-term
borrowings for the applicable Registrants were as follows:

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock
Southern Company
Common Stock
Stock Issued
During 2021, Southern Company issued approximately 3.5 million shares of common stock primarily through employee equity
compensation plans and received proceeds of approximately $73 million.
See "Equity Units" herein for additional information.
Shares Reserved
At December 31, 2021, a total of 127 million shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Southern Investment Plan,
employee savings plans, the Outside Directors Stock Plan, the Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (which includes stock
options and performance share units as discussed in Note 12), and an at-the-market program. Of the total 127 million shares
reserved, 31.5 million shares are available for awards under the Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan at December 31, 2021.
Diluted Earnings Per Share
For Southern Company, the only differences in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are attributable to awards
outstanding under stock-based compensation plans and the Equity Units. Earnings per share dilution resulting from stock-based
compensation plans and the Equity Units issuance is determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute diluted
EPS were as follows:

As reported shares 1,061 1,058 1,046 
Effect of stock-based compensation 7 7 8 
Diluted shares 1,068 1,065 1,054 
In all years presented, an immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was not included in the diluted EPS calculation
because the awards were anti-dilutive.
The Equity Units were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for all years presented as the dilutive stock price threshold was
not met.
Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries
As discussed further under "Alabama Power" herein, the preferred stock of Alabama Power is presented as "Redeemable Preferred
Stock of Subsidiaries" on Southern Company's balance sheets in a manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable
accounting standards.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, and common stock outstanding. Alabama Power also has authorized
preference stock, none of which is outstanding. Alabama Power's preferred stock and Class A preferred stock, without preference
between classes, rank senior to Alabama Power's common stock with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary and
involuntary dissolution. The preferred stock and Class A preferred stock of Alabama Power contain a feature that allows the holders
to elect a majority of Alabama Power's board of directors if preferred dividends are not paid for four consecutive quarters. Because
such a potential redemption-triggering event is not solely within the control of Alabama Power, the preferred stock and Class A
preferred stock is presented as "Redeemable Preferred Stock" on Alabama Power's balance sheets in a manner consistent with
temporary equity under applicable accounting standards.

Georgia Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock authorized, but only common

Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power has preferred stock and common stock authorized, but only common stock outstanding.
Dividend Restrictions
The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021,
consolidated retained earnings included $4.4 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained
earnings or paid-in-capital.
See Note 7 under "Southern Power" for information regarding the distribution requirements for certain Southern Power
subsidiaries.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to
affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2021, the amount of Southern Company
Gas' subsidiary retained earnings restricted for dividend payment totaled $1.3 billion.
Structural Considerations
Since Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern
Company Gas and, hence, the right of creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution
of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas, whether upon liquidation,
reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.
Southern Company Gas' 100%-owned subsidiary, Southern Company Gas Capital, was established to provide for certain of
Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid
securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by
Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company
Gas Capital for its financing needs.
Southern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement are unsecured senior
indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are
effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern
Power's subsidiaries.(*)

9. LEASES
On January 1, 2019, the Registrants adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 842 (as amended), Leases (ASC 842), which
require lessees to recognize leases with a term of greater than 12 months on the balance sheet as lease obligations, representing the
discounted future fixed payments due, along with ROU assets that will be amortized over the term of each lease.
The Registrants elected the transition methodology provided by ASC 842, whereby the applicable requirements were applied on a
prospective basis as of the adoption date. The Registrants also elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASC 842
that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to
continue without reassessment. Additionally, the Registrants applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease
terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for
as leases not to be reassessed.
Lessee
As lessee, the Registrants lease certain electric generating units (including renewable energy facilities), real estate/land,
communication towers, railcars, and other equipment and vehicles. The major categories of lease obligations are as follows:

Real estate/land leases primarily consist of commercial real estate leases at Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern
Company Gas and various land leases primarily associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power. The commercial
real estate leases have remaining terms of up to 24 years while the land leases have remaining terms of up to 45 years, including
renewal periods.
Communication towers are leased for the installation of equipment to provide cellular phone service to customers and to support
the automated meter infrastructure programs at the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas. Communication tower
leases have remaining terms of up to 15 years with options to renew that could extend the terms for an additional 15 years.
Renewal options exist in many of the leases. Except as otherwise noted, the expected term used in calculating the lease obligation
generally reflects only the noncancelable period of the lease as it is not considered reasonably certain that the lease will be
extended. Land leases associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power and communication tower leases for
automated meter infrastructure at Nicor Gas include renewal periods reasonably certain of exercise resulting in an expected lease
term at least equal to the expected life of the renewable energy facilities and the automated meter infrastructure, respectively.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Contracts that Contain a Lease
While not specifically structured as a lease, some of the PPAs at Alabama Power and Georgia Power are deemed to represent a
lease of the underlying electric generating units when the terms of the PPA convey the right to control the use of the underlying
assets. Amounts recorded for leases of electric generating units are generally based on the amount of scheduled capacity payments
due over the remaining term of the PPA, which varies between one and 17 years. Georgia Power has several PPAs with Southern
Power that Georgia Power accounts for as leases with a lease obligation of $521 million and $575 million at December 31, 2021
and 2020, respectively. The amount paid for energy under these affiliate PPAs reflects a price that would be paid in an arm's-length
transaction as reviewed and approved by the Georgia PSC.
Short-term Leases
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Registrants generally recognize lease
expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Residual Value Guarantees
Residual value guarantees exist primarily in railcar leases at Alabama Power and Georgia Power and the amounts probable of being
paid under those guarantees are included in the lease payments. All such amounts are immaterial at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Lease and Nonlease Components
For all asset categories, with the exception of electric generating units, gas pipelines, and real estate leases, the Registrants combine
lease payments and any nonlease components, such as asset maintenance, for purposes of calculating the lease obligation and the
right-of-use asset.

Lessor
The Registrants are each considered lessors in various arrangements that have been determined to contain a lease due to the
customer's ability to control the use of the underlying asset owned by the applicable Registrant. For the traditional electric
operating companies, these arrangements consist of outdoor lighting contracts accounted for as operating leases with initial terms of
up to seven years, after which the contracts renew on a month-to-month basis at the customer's option. For Mississippi Power, these
arrangements also include a tolling arrangement related to an electric generating unit accounted for as a sales-type lease with a
remaining term of 17 years. For Southern Power, these arrangements consist of PPAs related to electric generating units, including
solar and wind facilities, accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 25 years and PPAs related to battery
energy storage facilities accounted for as sales-type leases with remaining terms of up to 19 years. Southern Company Gas is the
lessor in operating leases related to gas pipelines with remaining terms of up to 21 years. For Southern Company, these
arrangements also include PPAs related to fuel cells accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 12 years.

No profit or loss was recognized by Mississippi Power when a tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type lease began in
2019. During 2020 and 2021, Mississippi Power completed construction of additional leased assets under the lease and, upon
completion, the book values of $26 million and $39 million, respectively, were transferred from CWIP to lease receivables. Each
transfer represented a non-cash investing transaction for purposes of the statements of cash flows.
During 2021, Southern Power completed construction of a portion of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities'
assets and recorded losses totaling $40 million upon commencement of the related PPAs, which Southern Power accounts for as
sales-type leases. The losses were due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners in these
projects, and no estimated residual asset value was assumed in calculating the losses. Each lease has an initial term of 20 years.
Upon commencement of the leases, the book values of the related assets totaling $210 million were derecognized from CWIP and
lease receivables were recorded. At December 31, 2021, the current portion of the lease receivables totaling $12 million is included
in other current assets and the long-term portion totaling $161 million is included in miscellaneous property and investments on
Southern Company's balance sheet and net investment in sales-type leases on Southern Power's consolidated balance sheet. The
transfers represented noncash investing transactions for purposes of the statement of cash flows. See Note 15 under "Southern

Southern Company Leveraged Lease
At December 31, 2020, a subsidiary of Southern Holdings had four leveraged lease agreements related to energy generation,
distribution, and transportation assets, including two domestic and two international projects. During 2021, one of the domestic
projects was sold and the agreements for both international projects were terminated. At December 31, 2021, one leveraged lease
agreement related to energy generation remains, with an expected remaining term of 10 years. Southern Company continues to
receive federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to this
investment. Southern Company wrote off the related investment balance in 2020, as discussed below.
Southern Company's net investment in leveraged leases at December 31, 2020 consisted of the following:

The following table provides a summary of the components of income related to leveraged lease investments. Income was impacted
in all periods presented by the impairment charges discussed below and in Note 15 under "Southern Company." Income in 2021

Since 2017, the financial and operational performance of the remaining domestic lessee and the associated generation assets raised
significant concerns about the short-term ability of the generation assets to produce cash flows sufficient to support ongoing
operations and the lessee's contractual obligations and its ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments through the
end of the lease term in 2047. In addition, following the expiration of the existing power offtake agreement in 2032, the lessee also
is exposed to remarketing risk, which encompasses the price and availability of alternative sources of generation.
In connection with the 2019 annual impairment analysis, Southern Company revised the estimated cash flows to be received under
the leveraged lease, which resulted in an impairment charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) recorded in the fourth quarter
2019. During the second quarter 2020, Southern Company received the latest annual forecasts of natural gas prices and considered
the significant decline in forecasted prices to be an indicator of potential impairment that required an interim impairment
assessment. Accordingly, consistent with prior impairment analyses, Southern Company evaluated the recoverability of the lease
receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets under various natural gas price scenarios to estimate the cash
flows expected to be received from remarketing the generation assets following the expiration of the existing PPA and the residual
value of the generation assets at the end of the lease. Based on the forecasts of energy prices in the years following the expiration of
the existing PPA, Southern Company concluded that it was no longer probable that any of the associated rental payments would be
received, because it was no longer probable the generation assets would be successfully remarketed and continue to operate after
that date. During the second quarter 2020, Southern Company revised the estimated cash flows to be received under the leveraged
lease to reflect this conclusion, which resulted in a full impairment of the lease investment and a pre-tax charge to earnings of $154
million ($74 million after tax).
All required lease payments through December 31, 2021 have been paid in full. If any future lease payments due prior to the
expiration of the associated PPA are not paid in full, the Southern Holdings subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding
payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. Failure to make the required payment to
the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to foreclose on, and take ownership(*)

of, the generation assets, in effect terminating the lease. As the remaining amount of the lease investment was charged against
earnings in the second quarter 2020, termination would not be expected to result in additional charges. Southern Company will
continue to monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make
the required lease payments and meet its obligations associated with a future closure or retirement of the generation assets and
associated properties, including the dry ash landfill.
10. INCOME TAXES
Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of
which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis, and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to
that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the federal tax liability.

Southern Company's and Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs generated in the current tax year and carried forward from prior tax
years that cannot be utilized in the current tax year are reclassified from current to deferred taxes in federal income tax expense in
the tables above. Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs reclassified in this manner include $6 million for 2021, $5 million for 2020, and
$51 million for 2019. Southern Power received $289 million, $340 million, and $734 million of cash related to federal ITCs under
renewable energy initiatives in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities" herein for additional
information.
In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional electric operating companies are deferred and
amortized over the average life of the related property, with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation
and amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural gas distribution utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as
well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are deferred and amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset.
ITCs amortized in 2021, 2020, and 2019 were immaterial for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company
Gas and were as follows for Southern Company and Southern Power:

2021 $ 84 $ 58

When Southern Power recognizes tax credits, the tax basis of the asset is reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net
deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax
expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. The tax benefit of the related basis differences reduced
income tax expense by $5 million in 2019.
State ITCs and other state credits, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Georgia Power's
income tax expense by $66 million in 2021, $67 million in 2020, and $51 million in 2019.
Southern Power's federal and state PTCs, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Southern
Power's income tax expense by $16 million in 2021, $15 million in 2020, and $12 million in 2019.
Effective Tax Rate
Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction,
non-taxable AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the
regulated utilities, and federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs primarily at Southern Power.
On July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent. As a result of the sale, changes in state
apportionment rates resulted in $85 million of additional net state tax expense. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.

The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have tax-related regulatory assets (deferred
income tax charges) and regulatory liabilities (deferred income tax credits). The regulatory assets are primarily attributable to tax
benefits flowed through to customers in prior years, deferred taxes previously recognized at rates lower than the current enacted tax
law, and taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The regulatory liabilities are primarily attributable to deferred taxes previously
recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized ITCs. See Note 2 for each Registrant's related
balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Year by which federal ITC/PTC carryforwards

The estimated tax credit utilization reflects the various sale transactions described in Note 15 and could be further delayed by
numerous factors, including the acquisition of additional renewable projects, an increase in Georgia Power's ownership interest
percentage in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the purchase of rights to additional PTCs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 pursuant to certain
joint ownership agreements, changes in taxable income projections, and potential income tax rate changes. See Note 2 under
"Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power also had approximately $428 million in net state investment and other net state tax credit
carryforwards for the State of Georgia that will expire between tax years 2021 and 2031 and are not expected to be fully utilized.
Georgia Power has a net state valuation allowance of $58 million associated with these carryforwards.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

State NOLs for Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Florida are not expected to be fully utilized prior to expiration. At December 31, 2021,
Mississippi Power had a net state valuation allowance of $32 million for the Mississippi NOL, Southern Power had net state
valuation allowances of $11 million for the Oklahoma NOL and $10 million for the Florida NOL, and Southern Company had a net
valuation allowance of $25 million for the New York and New York City NOLs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
Changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented were as follows:
Southern Company
(in millions)
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 and 2019 $ — 
Tax positions changes – increase from prior periods 44 
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020 44 
Tax positions changes – increase from prior periods 3 
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 $ 47 
The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2020 and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2020 and 2021 primarily relate to a 2019 state tax filing position to exclude certain gains from 2019 dispositions from taxation in a
certain unitary state. If accepted by the state, this position would decrease Southern Company's annual effective tax rate. The
ultimate outcome of this unrecognized tax benefit is dependent on completion of the related state audit, which is not expected to be
resolved within the next 12 months.
All of the Registrants classify interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. Accrued interest for all tax positions was immaterial
for all years presented. None of the Registrants accrued any penalties on uncertain tax positions.
The IRS has finalized its audits of Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through 2020. Southern Company
is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process of the IRS. The audits for the Registrants' state income tax returns have either
been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2015.
11. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the
exception of PowerSecure employees. The qualified pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the
year ended December 31, 2021 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated for the year ending
December 31, 2022. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of
management and highly compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system
provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The
traditional electric operating companies fund other postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory
commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care
and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses. For the year ending December 31, 2022, no contributions to
any other postretirement trusts are expected.

The Registrants estimate the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets using a financial
model to project the expected return on each current investment portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each
of the different asset classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust's target asset
allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset
class (based in part on historical returns), each trust's target asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact
of a periodic rebalancing of each trust's portfolio. Prior to 2020, the Registrants set the expected rate of return assumption using
asset return modeling based on geometric returns that reflect the compound average returns for dependent annual periods.
Beginning in 2020, the Registrants set the expected rate of return assumption using an arithmetic mean which represents the
expected simple average return to be earned by the pension plan assets over any one year. The Registrants believe the use of the
arithmetic mean is more compatible with the expected rate of return's function of estimating a single year's investment return.

An actuarial gain of $393 million was recorded for the annual remeasurement of the Southern Company system pension plans at
December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase of 28 basis points in the overall discount rate used to calculate the benefit
obligation as a result of higher market interest rates. An actuarial loss of $1.7 billion was recorded for the annual remeasurement of
the Southern Company system pension plans at December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease of 60 basis points in the overall
discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation as a result of lower market interest rates.

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is included in operations and maintenance expenses and all other
components of net periodic pension cost are included in other income (expense), net in the Registrants' statements of income.
Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected return on plan assets.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related
value of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Registrants have elected to amortize changes in the
market value of return-seeking plan assets over five years and to recognize the changes in the market value of liability-hedging plan
assets immediately. Given the significant concentration in return-seeking plan assets, the accounting value of plan assets that is
used to calculate the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.
Effective January 1, 2020, Southern Company changed its method of calculating the market-related value of the liability-hedging
securities included in its pension plan assets. The market-related value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets
component of net periodic pension cost. Southern Company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan assets, which
smoothed asset returns and deferred gains and losses by amortizing them into the calculation of the market-related value over five
years. Southern Company changed to the fair value approach for liability-hedging securities, which includes measuring the market-
related value of that portion of the plan assets at fair value for purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets. The
remaining asset classes of plan assets continue to be valued using the calculated value approach. Southern Company considers the
fair value approach to be preferable for liability-hedging securities because it results in a current reflection of changes in the value
of plan assets in the measurement of net periodic pension cost more consistent with the change in the related obligations.

Benefit Plan Assets
Pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The Registrants' investment policies for both the pension plans and the other
postretirement benefit plans cover a diversified mix of assets as described below. Derivative instruments may be used to gain
efficient exposure to the various asset classes and as hedging tools. Additionally, the Registrants minimize the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitor and manage other aspects of risk.
The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Southern Company system's qualified pension plan is to be broadly diversified
across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after consideration of various factors that affect the assets and
liabilities of the pension plan including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns and interest rates, volatility, correlations
of asset classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and liabilities. Because a significant
portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment
expectations for return and risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the Southern
Company system employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment managers and
service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent investment practices. Management believes the
portfolio is well-diversified with no significant concentrations of risk.
Southern Company's investment strategy also includes adjusting the established asset allocation to invest a larger portion of the
portfolio in fixed rate debt securities should the qualified pension plan achieve a predetermined funding threshold. Any future
reallocation of plan assets based on achieving the funding threshold would likely result in a reduction in the expected long-term
return on plan assets used to determine pension income. However, the amount of such a decrease and the related financial statement
impact cannot be determined at this time.

Investment Strategies and Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values
A description of the major asset classes that the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are comprised of, along with the
valuation methods used for fair value measurement, is provided below:
Description Valuation Methodology
Domestic equity: A mix of large and small capitalization stocks
with generally an equal distribution of value and growth
attributes, managed both actively and through passive index
approaches.
International equity: A mix of large and small capitalization
growth and value stocks with developed and emerging markets
exposure, managed both actively and through fundamental
indexing approaches.Domestic and international equities such as common stocks,
American depositary receipts, and real estate investment trusts
that trade on public exchanges are classified as Level 1
investments and are valued at the closing price in the active
market. Equity funds with unpublished prices that are comprised
of publicly traded securities (such as commingled/pooled funds)
are also valued at the closing price in the active market, but are
classified as Level 2.
Fixed income: A mix of domestic and international bonds.Investments in fixed income securities, including fixed income
pooled funds, are generally classified as Level 2 investments and
are valued based on prices reported in the market place.
Additionally, the value of fixed income securities takes into
consideration certain items such as broker quotes, spreads, yield
curves, interest rates, and discount rates that apply to the term of
a specific instrument.
Trust-owned life insurance (TOLI): Investments of taxable
trusts aimed at minimizing the impact of taxes on the portfolio.Investments in TOLI policies are classified as Level 2
investments and are valued based on the underlying investments
held in the policy's separate accounts. The underlying assets are
equity and fixed income pooled funds that are comprised of
Level 1 and Level 2 securities.
Special situations: Investments in opportunistic strategies with
the objective of diversifying and enhancing returns and
exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as investments in
promising new strategies of a longer-term nature.
Real estate: Investments in traditional private market, equity-
oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through
pooled funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate
securities.
Private equity: Investments in private partnerships that invest in
private or public securities typically through privately-negotiated
and/or structured transactions, including leveraged buyouts,
venture capital, and distressed debt.Investments in real estate, private equity, and special situations
are generally classified as Net Asset Value as a Practical
Expedient, since the underlying assets typically do not have
publicly available observable inputs. The fund manager values
the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the
nature of the underlying investments. Techniques may include
purchase multiples for comparable transactions, comparable
public company trading multiples, discounted cash flow
analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates, recent sales of
comparable investments, and independent third-party appraisals.
The fair value of partnerships is determined by aggregating the
value of the underlying assets less liabilities.
For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets and the appropriate level
designation, management relies on information provided by the plan's trustee. This information is reviewed and evaluated by
management with changes made to the trustee information as appropriate. The fair values presented herein exclude cash,
receivables related to investment income and pending investment sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases. The
Registrants did not have any investments classified as Level 3 at December 31, 2020.

12. STOCK COMPENSATION
Stock-based compensation primarily in the form of Southern Company performance share units (PSU) and restricted stock units
(RSU) may be granted through the Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan to Southern Company system employees ranging from
line management to executives.
At December 31, 2021, the number of current and former employees participating in stock-based compensation programs for the
Registrants was as follows:
Southern
CompanyAlabama
PowerGeorgia
PowerMississippi
PowerSouthern
PowerSouthern
Company Gas
Number of employees 1,728 241 271 70 45 173 
The majority of PSUs and RSUs awarded contain terms where employees become immediately vested in PSUs and RSUs upon
retirement. As a result, compensation expense for employees that are retirement eligible at the grant date is recognized
II-238

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
immediately, while compensation expense for employees that become retirement eligible during the vesting period is recognized
over the period from grant date to the date of retirement eligibility. In addition, the Registrants recognize forfeitures as they occur.
All unvested PSUs and RSUs vest immediately upon a change in control where Southern Company is not the surviving
corporation.
Performance Share Units
PSUs granted to employees vest at the end of a three-year performance period. Shares of Southern Company common stock are
delivered to employees at the end of the performance period with the number of shares issued ranging from 0% to 200% of the
target number of PSUs granted, based on achievement of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of the
Southern Company Board of Directors.
Southern Company has issued three types of PSUs, each with a unique performance goal. These types of PSUs include total
shareholder return (TSR) awards based on the TSR for Southern Company common stock during the three-year performance period
as compared to a group of industry peers; ROE awards based on Southern Company's equity-weighted return over the performance
period; and EPS awards based on Southern Company's cumulative EPS over the performance period. EPS awards were last granted
in 2017.
The fair value of TSR awards is determined as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. In determining the fair
value of the TSR awards issued to employees, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Southern Company's
stock over a period equal to the performance period. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant that covers the performance period of the awards. The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model
and the weighted average grant-date fair value of TSR awards granted:
Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019
Expected volatility 30.0% 15.4% 15.6%
Expected term (in years) 3 3 3
Interest rate 0.2% 1.4% 2.4%
Weighted average grant-date fair value $69.06 $77.65 $62.71
The Registrants recognize TSR award compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year performance period
without remeasurement.
The fair values of EPS awards and ROE awards are based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the
date of the grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the ROE awards granted during 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $59.49,
$68.42, and $49.38, respectively. Compensation expense for EPS and ROE awards is generally recognized ratably over the three-
year performance period adjusted for expected changes in EPS and ROE performance. Total compensation cost recognized for
vested EPS awards and ROE awards reflects final performance metrics.
Southern Company had 2.2 million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2020. In February 2021, the PSUs that vested for
the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2020 were converted into 2.5 million shares outstanding at a share price of
$60.10. During 2021, Southern Company granted 1.3 million PSUs and 1.3 million PSUs were vested or forfeited, resulting in 2.2
million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2021. In February 2022, the PSUs that vested for the three-year performance
period ended December 31, 2021 were converted into 2.5 million shares outstanding at a weighted average share price of $66.57.
Total PSU compensation cost, and the related tax benefit recognized in income, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and
2019 are as follows:

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
Total PSU compensation cost and the related tax benefit recognized in income were immaterial for all periods presented for all
other Registrants. The compensation cost related to the grant of Southern Company PSUs to the employees of each Subsidiary
Registrant is recognized in each Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity representing a
capital contribution from Southern Company.
At December 31, 2021, Southern Company's total unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs was $32 million and is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 19 months. The total unrecognized compensation cost
related to PSUs at December 31, 2021 was immaterial for all other Registrants.
Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the date of the grant. The
weighted average grant-date fair values of RSUs granted during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $59.56, $67.60, and $50.44,
respectively. For most RSU awards, one-third of the RSUs vest each year throughout a three-year service period and compensation
cost for RSUs is generally recognized over the corresponding one-, two-, or three-year vesting period. Shares of Southern Company
common stock are delivered to employees at the end of each vesting period.
Southern Company had 1.2 million RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2020. During 2021, Southern Company granted 0.5 million
RSUs and 0.6 million RSUs were vested or forfeited, resulting in 1.1 million unvested RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2021,
including RSUs related to employee retention agreements.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Southern Company's total compensation cost for RSUs recognized in
income was $32 million, $29 million, and $28 million, respectively. The related tax benefit also recognized in income was $8
million, $8 million, and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Total unrecognized
compensation cost related to RSUs at December 31, 2021, which is being recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately 16 months, is immaterial for Southern Company.
Total RSUs outstanding and total compensation cost and related tax benefit for the RSUs recognized in income for the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, as well as the total unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2021, were immaterial
for all other Registrants. The compensation cost related to the grant of Southern Company RSUs to the employees of each
Subsidiary Registrant is recognized in such Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity
representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.
Stock Options
In 2015, Southern Company discontinued granting stock options. As of December 31, 2017, all stock option awards were vested
and compensation cost fully recognized. Stock options expire no later than 10 years after the grant date and the latest possible
exercise will occur by November 2024. At December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the options
outstanding and exercisable was approximately 19 months.
Southern Company's activity in the stock option program for 2021 is summarized below:

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is
minimized for fair value measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques
used for fair value measurement.
•Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is either directly or indirectly observable.
•Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of each Registrant of what a market
participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If there is little available market data, then each Registrant's own
assumptions are the best available information.
In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement represents the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.
Net asset value as a practical expedient is the classification used for assets that do not have readily determined fair values. Fund
managers value the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the nature of the underlying investments.

Valuation Methodologies
The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and
physical power products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry
and are valued using the market approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas
prices, power prices, implied volatility, and overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-
counter products that are valued using observable market data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair
value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based
on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract
terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair value of cross-currency swaps
reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of
future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms,
counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under
Fair Value Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note 14 for
additional information on how these derivatives are used.
For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred
compensation trusts, external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary
pricing source. For investments held within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the
net asset value, which is established by obtaining the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A
market price secured from the primary source vendor is then evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the
trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather market data (including indices and market research
reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector news into proprietary pricing models,
pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading levels and pricing
analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.
The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of
funds for future decommissioning. See Note 6 under "Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional information.
Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to certain acquisitions whereby it is primarily obligated to make
generation-based payments to the seller, which commenced at the commercial operation of the respective facility and continue
through 2026. The obligations are categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using
significant unobservable inputs for the forecasted facility generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a fixed dollar
amount per MW-hour, and a discount rate. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the net present value of expected
payments and any periodic change arising from forecasted generation is expected to be immaterial.
Southern Power also has payment obligations through 2040 whereby it must reimburse the transmission owners for interconnection
facilities and network upgrades constructed to support connection of a Southern Power generating facility to the transmission
system. The obligations are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using observable
inputs for the contracted amounts and reimbursement period, as well as a discount rate. The fair value of the obligations reflects the
net present value of expected payments.
"Other investments" include investments traded in the open market that have maturities greater than 90 days, which are categorized
as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements and are comprised of corporate bonds, bank certificates of deposit, treasury bonds,
and/or agency bonds.
The fair value measurements of private equity investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that are
calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled $150 million and $76 million at
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unfunded commitments related to the private equity investments totaled $69 million
and $73 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Private equity investments include high-quality private equity
funds across several market sectors and funds that invest in real estate assets. Private equity funds do not have redemption rights.
Distributions from these funds will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.

14. DERIVATIVES
Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas are exposed to
market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk.
To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of
natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in
areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern
Company Gas' wholesale gas operations used various contracts in its commercial activities that generally met the definition of
derivatives. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas' other businesses, each
company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable
risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation,
value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as
either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note 13 for additional fair value information. In the statements of
cash flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash(*) (*)

impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the
classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. See Note 1 under "Financial Instruments" for additional information.
See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information regarding the sale of Sequent.
Energy-Related Derivatives
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to
hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other
various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited
exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain
of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of
their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are
expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating
capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-
term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any
uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile
energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.
Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal
weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded
options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are
reflected in operating revenues.
Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:
•Regulatory Hedges – Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional
electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are
initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel
is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.
•Cash Flow Hedges – Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to
hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in
the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.
•Not Designated – Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred.
Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is
both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled
physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item
representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

Southern Power 5 2030 2022
Southern Company Gas 68 2024 2025
(*)Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short
position is a contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural
gas positions of 6 million mmBtu at December 31, 2021, which is also included in Southern Company's total volume. See Note 15 under "Southern Company
Gas" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.
In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical
natural gas supply contracts that provide the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum
expected volume of natural gas subject to such a feature is 26 million mmBtu for Southern Company, which includes 6 million
mmBtu for Alabama Power, 8 million mmBtu for Georgia Power, 4 million mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and 8 million mmBtu
for Southern Power.
For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains (losses) expected to be reclassified from AOCI to
earnings for the year ending December 31, 2022 are immaterial for all Registrants.
Interest Rate Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the
derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and presented on the
same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate
securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains
or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives
that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

For cash flow hedge interest rate derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains (losses) expected to be reclassified from AOCI to interest
expense for the year ending December 31, 2022 total $(21) million for Southern Company and are immaterial for all other
Registrants. Deferred gains and losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be amortized into earnings through 2051
for Southern Company, 2051 for Alabama Power, 2044 for Georgia Power, 2028 for Mississippi Power, and 2046 for Southern
Company Gas.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge
exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency
other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives'
fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same income statement
line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S.
currency exchange rates. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the
derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same
income statement line item, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates.
Southern Company has elected to exclude the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of effectiveness in the fair value
hedges of its foreign currency risk and record any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and
the amounts recognized in earnings as a component of OCI.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts
Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into derivative
contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and payables for routine
billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also utilize master
netting agreements to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain provisions that permit netting
across product lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are
presented net to the extent that there are netting arrangements or similar agreements with the counterparties.

The pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial for all other Registrants for
all years presented.
Contingent Features
Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas do not have any
credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit
rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the Registrants had no collateral posted with
derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.
For the applicable Registrants, the fair value of interest rate and energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or
Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2021. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related
contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could
require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below
investment grade. Following the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy, Gulf Power has continued participating in the Southern
Company power pool; however, on December 21, 2021, NextEra Energy provided a 180-day notice of its intention to cease such
participation.
Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value
amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are not offset against fair value
amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty.
Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial
derivative transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the
associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2021, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial. Southern
Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative(*)

transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas
may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2021, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin
accounts was immaterial.
The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The
Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by
Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. The Registrants have also
established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including
requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is
most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S.
government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties
an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit
reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when
deemed necessary.
Southern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting
agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash
collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to,
counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables and energy
marketing payables.
The Registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty
nonperformance.
15. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
None of the dispositions discussed herein, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for the
applicable Registrants that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the
assets related to the sales have been classified as discontinued operations for any of the periods presented.
Southern Company
In January 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of all of the capital stock of Gulf Power to a wholly-owned subsidiary of
NextEra Energy, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed),
including the final working capital adjustments. The gain associated with the sale of Gulf Power totaled $2.6 billion pre-tax ($1.4
billion after tax).
In July 2019, PowerSecure completed the sale of its utility infrastructure services business for approximately $65 million, including
the final working capital adjustments. In contemplation of this sale, a goodwill impairment charge of $32 million was recorded in
the second quarter 2019. In December 2019, PowerSecure completed the sale of its lighting business for approximately $9 million,
which included cash of $4 million and a note receivable from the buyer of $5 million. In contemplation of this sale, an impairment
charge of $18 million was recorded in the third quarter 2019 related to goodwill, identifiable intangibles, and other assets.
In December 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of one of its leveraged lease investments for an aggregate cash purchase
price of approximately $20 million. The sale resulted in an immaterial gain.
In connection with the annual impairment analysis of a leveraged lease investment during the fourth quarter 2020, Southern
Company management concluded that the estimated residual value of the generation assets should be reduced due to significant
uncertainty as to whether the related natural gas generation assets would continue to operate at the end of the lease term in 2040
and recorded a $34 million ($17 million after tax) impairment charge. Also during the fourth quarter 2020, Southern Company
management initiated steps to sell the investment and reclassified it as held for sale at December 31, 2020. In the fourth quarter
2020 and the second quarter 2021, additional charges of $18 million ($14 million after tax) and $7 million ($6 million after tax),
respectively, were recorded to further reduce the investment to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. On October 29, 2021,
Southern Company completed the sale to the lessee for $45 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale; however, it did
result in the recognition of approximately $16 million of additional tax benefits.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report
On December 13, 2021, Southern Company completed the termination of its leasehold interest in assets associated with its two
international leveraged lease projects and received cash proceeds of approximately $673 million after the accelerated exercise of
the lessee's purchase options. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $93 million ($99 million gain
after tax).
Alabama Power
In August 2020, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station, an approximately 885-MW
combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. The total purchase price was $461 million, of which $452 million
was related to net assets recorded within property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet and the remainder primarily related to
inventory, current receivables, and accounts payable. Alabama Power assumed an existing power sales agreement under which the
full output of the generating facility remains committed to another third party for its remaining term of approximately three years.
During the remaining term, the estimated revenues from the power sales agreement are expected to offset the associated costs of
operation. See Notes 2 and 9 under "Alabama Power" and "Lessor," respectively, for additional information.
On September 23, 2021, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Calhoun Power
Company, LLC, which owns and operates the Calhoun Generating Station. See Note 2 under "Alabama Power – Certificates of
Convenience and Necessity" for additional information.

Development Projects
Southern Power continues to evaluate and refine the deployment of the remaining wind turbine equipment purchased in 2016 and
2017 for development and construction projects. Wind projects utilizing equipment purchased in 2016 and 2017, and reaching
commercial operation by the end of 2021 and 2022, are expected to qualify for 100% and 80% PTCs, respectively. The significant
majority of this equipment either has been deployed to projects that have been completed, are under construction, or are probable of
completion, or has been sold to third parties. Gains on wind turbine equipment contributed to various equity method investments
totaled approximately $37 million in 2021. Gains on wind turbine equipment sales were immaterial in 2020 and totaled
approximately $17 million in 2019.

Southern Company Gas
Sale of Sequent
On July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent to Williams Field Services Group for a total cash
purchase price of $159 million, including final working capital adjustments. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was
approximately $121 million ($92 million after tax). As a result of the sale, changes in state apportionment rates resulted in
$85 million of additional tax expense.
Prior to the sale, Southern Company Gas had existing agreements in place in which it guaranteed the payment performance of
Sequent. Southern Company Gas will continue to guarantee Sequent's payment performance for a period of time as Williams Field
Services Group obtains releases from these obligations. At December 31, 2021, the remaining obligations subject to the payment
performance guarantee were immaterial. Changes in the price of natural gas, market conditions, and the number of open contracts
may change the amount that Southern Company Gas is required to guarantee for Sequent each month.
Sale of Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline
In March 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline to Dominion
Modular LNG Holdings, Inc. and Dominion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC, respectively, with aggregate proceeds of $178 million,
including final working capital adjustments. The loss associated with the transactions was immaterial. During 2019, based on the
terms of these transactions, Southern Company Gas recorded an asset impairment charge, exclusive of the contingent payments, for
Pivotal LNG of approximately $24 million ($17 million after tax) as of December 31, 2019. In connection with the sale, Southern
Company Gas was entitled to two $5 million payments contingent upon Dominion Modular LNG Holdings, Inc. meeting certain
milestones related to Pivotal LNG. Southern Company Gas received the first payment on April 22, 2021 and expects to receive the
second payment in March 2022.
Sale of Natural Gas Storage Facility
In December 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of Jefferson Island to EnLink Midstream, LLC for a total purchase
price of $33 million, including estimated working capital adjustments. The gain associated with the sale totaled $22 million pre-tax
($16 million after tax). In 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $91 million ($69 million after-
tax) related to Jefferson Island.
Sale of Triton
In May 2019, Southern Company Gas sold its investment in Triton, a cargo container leasing company that was aggregated into
Southern Company Gas' all other segment. This disposition resulted in a pre-tax loss of $6 million and a net after-tax gain of $7
million as a result of reversing a $13 million federal income tax valuation allowance.(a)(b)
