PART I
Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
NEE is one of the largest electric power and energy infrastructure companies in North America and a leader in the renewable energy
industry . NEE has two principal businesses, FPL and NEER. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the
largest electric utilities in the U.S. FPL’s strategic focus is centered on investing in generation, transmission and distribution facilities
to continue to deliver on its value proposition of low bills, high reliability , outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for
the benefit of its more than five million customers. NEER is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.
NEER’ s strategic focus is centered on the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets throughout the
U.S. and Canada, includ ing renewable generation facilities, natural gas pipelines, electric transm ission facilities and battery storage
projects. In January 2019, NEE completed the acquisition of Gulf Power , a rate-regulated electric utility engaged in the generation,
transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in northwest Florida. See Gulf Power section below .
As described in more detail in the following sections, NEE seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its
customers' needs more economically and more  reliably than its competitors. NEE's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over
sustained periods at both FPL and NEER. Management seeks to grow each business in a manner consistent with the varying
opportunities available to it; however , manageme nt believes that the diversification and balance represented by FPL and NEER is a
valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to NEE's financial strength in different ways.
FPL and NEER share a common platform with the objective of lowering costs and creating efficiencies for their businesses. NEE and
its subsidiaries continue to develop and implement enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving productivity , process
effectiveness and quality .
NEE, which employed approximately 14,800 people at December 31, 2019 , was incorp orated in 1984 under the laws of Florida.
NEE's segments for financial reporting purposes are FPL, Gulf Power and NEER, which is comprised of two wholly owned
subsidiaries of NEE that are combined for segment reporting purposes. NEECH, another wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, owns and
provides funding for NEE's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL and its subsidiaries and Gulf Power . NEP, an affiliate of NextEra
Energy Reso urces, was formed in 2014. NEP acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term
cash flows. See NEER section below for further discussion of NEP, including changes to its governance structure, which resulted in
the deconsolidation of NEP  in January 2018.

FPL
FPL was incorporated under the laws of Florida in 1925 and is a rate-regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation,
transmission, distribution  and sale of electric energy in Florida. In 2018, FPL acquired a retail gas business (see Note 8 - Other). FPL
is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. At December 31, 2019 , FPL had
approximately 27,400 MW of net generating capacity , approximately  75,400  circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines and
661 substations. FPL provides service to its electric customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links
its generation facilities to its customers. At December 31, 2019 , FPL served  more than ten million people through more than five
million  customer accounts. FPL's service territory , which covers most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida, and plant
locations at December 31, 2019  were as follows (see FPL  Sources of Generation below):

CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE
FPL's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers
within Florida. The percentage of FPL's operating revenues and customer accounts  by customer class were as follows:
For both retail and wholesale customers, the prices (or rates) that FPL may charge are approved by regulatory bodies, by the FPSC
in the case of retail customers and by the FERC in the case of wholesale customers. In general, under U.S. and Florida law,
regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Since
the regulator y bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital
employed, there can be no guarantee that FPL will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through
regulated rates. See FPL  Regulation below .
FPL seeks to maintain attractive rates for its customers. Since rates are largely cost-based, main taining low rates requires a strategy
focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position, including the implementation of ideas generated from cost savings
initiatives. A common benchmark used in the electric power industry for comparing rates across companies is the price of 1,000 kWh
of consumpt ion per month for a residential custo mer. FPL's 2019  average bill for 1,000 kWh of monthly residenti al usage was well
below both the average of reporting electric utilities within Florida and the July 2019  nation al average (the latest date for which this
data is available) as indicated below:

Table of Contents
FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITION
FPL's service to its electric retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or
counties. During the term of a franchise agreement, which is typically 30 years, the municipality or county agrees not to form its own
utility , and FPL has the right to offer electric service to residents. FPL currently holds  184 franchise agreements with various
municipalities and counties in Florida with varyin g expiration dates through  2049. These franchise agreements cover approximately
88% of FPL's retail customer base in Florida. FPL also provides service to customers in 11 other municipalities and to 22
unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public
utility . FPL  relies upon Florida law for access to public rights of way .
Because any customer may elect to provide his/her own electric services, FPL effectively must compete for an individual customer's
business. As a practical matter , few customers provide their own service at the present time since FPL's cost of service is lower than
the cost of self-generation for the vast majority of customers. Changing technology , economic  conditions and other factors could
alter the favorable relative cost position that FPL currently enjoys; however , FPL seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it
delivers superior value, in the form of low customer bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service.
In addition to self-generation by residential, commercial and industrial customers, FPL also faces competition from other suppliers of
electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources. In each of 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , operating revenues
from wholesale and industrial electric customers combined represented approximately five percent of FPL's total operating revenues.
For the building of new steam and solar generati ng capacity of 75 MW or greater , the FPSC requires investor-owned electric utilities,
including FPL, to issue a request for proposal (RFP) except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is
in the public  interest. The RFP process allows  independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating
capacity . If a bidder has the most cost-ef fective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates
adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned
electric utility would seek to negotiate a purchas ed power agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve
the terms of the purcha sed power agreement and, if appropriate, provide the required autho rization for the construction of the
bidder's generating capacity .
FPL SOURCES OF GENERATION
At December 31, 2019 , FPL's resources for serving load consisted of approximately  27,554 MW, of which 27,440 MW were from
FPL-owned facilities and 114 MW were available through purchased power agreements. FPL owned and operated 31 units that
used fossil fuels, primar ily natural gas, with generating capacity of 22,170 MW and had a joint ownership interest in 1 out-of-state
coal unit, which it does not operate, with net generating capacity of 634 MW. In addition, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in,
and operate d, 4 nuclear units with net generating capacity totaling 3,479 MW (see Nuclea r Operation s below) and owned and
operated  17 solar generation facilities with generating capacity totaling 1,157 MW (excluding 75 MW of non-incremental solar
capability which is provided in conjunction with a natural gas generation facility). FPL customer  usage and operating revenues are
typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in FPL's service territory .
Occasionally , unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short
periods of time.
FPL is in the process of modernizing two generating units at its Lauderdale facility to a high-ef ficiency , clean-burning natural gas unit
(Dania Beach Clean Energy Center). The Dania Beach Clean Energy Center is expected to provide approximately 1,200 MW of
generating capacity and to be in service in 2022.

Fuel Sources
FPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, the ability of some of its generation facilities to operate on both
natural gas and oil, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more econom ical fuel mix in order to respond to
market and industry developments.
*approximately 71% has dual fuel capability *Oil is less than 1%
Significant Fuel and T ransportation Contracts.  At December 31, 2019 , FPL  had the following significant fuel and transportation
contracts in place:
•FPL has firm transportation contracts with seven different transportation suppliers for natural gas pipeline capacity for an
aggregate maximum quantity of 2,769,000 MMBtu/day currently , of which 1,969,000 MMBtu/ day have expiration dates
ranging from 2020 to 2036. The remaining 800,000 MMBtu/day increases to 1,200,000 MMBt u/day starting in mid-2020
through 2042.  See Note 15 - Contracts.
•FPL has several contrac ts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with
expiration dates ranging from March 2020 through 2032.
•Additionally , FPL enters into short- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated
needs for natural gas. The remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements is purchased in the spot market.
Nuclear Operations
At December 31, 2019 , FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the four nuclear units in Florida discussed below .
FPL's nuclea r units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including
inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service
for variable lengths of time.

Table of Contents
FPL's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities,
which are expected to provide suf ficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through license expiration.
FPL ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING
FPL's Energy Marketing & Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commod ities, such as natural gas, oil and
electricity . EMT procures natural gas and oil for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess  natural gas, oil and electricity . EMT
also uses derivative instruments (primarily swap s, options and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the
purchase and sale of fuel and electricity . Substa ntially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the
fuel or capacity clauses. See Management's Discussion - Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 4.
FPL REGULATION
FPL's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organization s, including, but not limited to, the
following:
•the FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service territory , issuances of securities, planning, siting and construction of
facilities, among other things;
•the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of
electricity and natural gas in interstate commerc e, proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage
facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy , among other things;
•the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by
the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system
blackouts;
•the NRC, which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuan ce of operating licenses, rules,
regulations and orders; and
•the EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in some
cases delegating authority to state agencies. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal
and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation ef forts.
FPL Electric Rate Regulation
The FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow FPL the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue
requirements) equal to FPL's cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this,
the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses.
Base Rates . In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through
base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs
include O&M  expenses, depreciation and taxes , as well as a return on FPL's investment in assets used and useful in providing
electric service (rate base). At the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's
determination of FPL's estimated weighted-ave rage cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed
return on common equity . The FPSC monitors FPL's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly by FPL
with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate
proceedings or through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of FPL or upon action
by the FPSC. Existing base rates remain in ef fect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.
Base Rates Effective January 2017 through at least December 2020 - In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving a
stipulation and settlemen t between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2016 rate agreement). Key elements
of the 2016 rate agreem ent, which is effective from January 2017 through at least December 2020, include, among other things, the
following:
•New retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:
◦$400 million beginning January 1, 2017;
◦$211 million beginning January 1, 2018; and
◦$200 million beginning April 1, 2019 for a new approximately 1,720 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit in
Okeechobee County , Florida (Okeechobee Clean Energy Center) that achieved commercial operation on
March 31, 2019.
•In addition, FPL is eligib le to receive base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 300 MW annually of new solar
generation in each of 2017 through 2020 with an installed cost cap of $1,750 per kW. Approx imately 900 MW of new solar
generating capacity has become operational, 600 MW in the first quarter of 2018 and 300 MW in the first quarter of 2019. An
additional 300 MW is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2020.
•FPL's allowed regulatory ROE is 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.60%,
FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.60%, any party other than FPL may seek a
review of FPL's retail base rates.

Table of Contents
•Subject to certain condi tions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2016 rate agreement, up to $1.0 billion of depreciation
reserve surplus plus the reserve amount that remained under FPL's previous rate agreement (approximately $250 million),
provided that in any year of the 2016 rate agreement FPL must amortize at least enough reserve to maintain a 9.60% earned
regulatory ROE but may not amortize any reserve that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11.60%.
•Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery
petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on
residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery . Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent
years. If storm restorati on costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4
surcharge to recover amounts above $400 million. See Note 1 - Storm Fund, Storm Reser ve and Storm Cost Recovery
regarding several hurricanes that impacted FPL's service territory from 2016 - 2019.
Cost Recovery Clauses . Cost recove ry clauses are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return  on certain
assets allowed to be recovered through various clauses. Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly
charges per kWh or kW, depending on the customer's rate class. These cost recovery clause charges are calculated annually based
on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus true-up adjustments to reflect the estimated
over or unde r recovery of costs for the current and prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the
course of a year to reflect revised estimates. FPL  recovers costs from customers through the following clauses:
•Fuel - primarily fuel costs, the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operatin g revenues (see Note 1 -
Rate Regulation);
•Capacity - primarily certain costs associated with the acquisition of several electric generation facilities (see Note 1 - Rate
Regulation);
•Energy Conservation - costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs; and
•Environmental - certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993
and costs associated with three of FPL's solar facilities placed in service prior to 2016.
In June 2019, Florida's Governor signed legislation into law which directed the FPSC to propose new rules that would (i) require
state investor-owned utilities to submit a 10-year  transmission and distribution storm protection plan (SPP) to the FPSC for approval
at least every three years and (ii) provide for annual clause recovery of storm protection plan costs not already recovered in base
rates or through other clauses, including costs for hardening of overhead transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding of
certain distri bution lines and vegetation management. In October 2019, the FPSC issued its proposed SPP and SPP cost recovery
clause rules. Final rules will become ef fective on February 18, 2020.
The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. These costs may
include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm
restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities.
FERC
The Federal Power Act grants the FERC exclusi ve ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of
electricity and natural gas in interstate commerc e. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, electric utilities must maintain tariffs and rate
schedules on file with the FERC which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provisio n of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale
power and transmission  services. The Federal Power Act also gives the FERC authority to certify and oversee an electric reliability
organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and
operators of the bulk-power system. See NERC below . Electric utilities are subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting
requirements administer ed by the FERC. The FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their
affiliates.
NERC
The NERC has been certified by the FERC as an electric reliability organization. The NERC's mandate is to ensure the reliability and
security of the North American bulk-power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by
FERC. The NERC's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the FERC . FPL is subject to these reliability
standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements, and can incur significant penalties for
failing to comply with them.
FPL Environmental Regulation
FPL is subject to environmental laws and regula tions as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below . FPL expects to
seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.

FPL EMPLOYEES
FPL had approximately 8,900 employees at December 31, 2019 , with appro ximately 32% of these employees represented by the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), substantially all of which are under a collective bargaining agreement with
FPL that expires October 31, 2020.
NEER
NextEra Energy Resour ces was formed in 1998 to aggregate NEE's competitive energy businesses. During the fourth quarter of
2019, NEE began reporting NextEra Energy Resources and NEET , a rate-regulated transmission business, on a combined basis for
segment reporting purposes, and the combined segment is referred to as NEER. NEET  previo usly was reported in Corporate and
Other . See Note 16. NEER is a diversified clean energy business with a strategy that emphasizes the development, construction and
operation of long-term contracted assets with a focus on renewable projects. The NEER segment currently owns, develops,
constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets primarily in the U.S. and Canada.
NEER, with approximately 21,900  MW of total net generating capacity at December 31, 2019 , is one of the largest wholesale
generators of electric power in the U.S., including approximately 21,240  MW of net generating capacity across 37 state s and 520
MW of net generating capacity in 4 Canadian provinces (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets). At December 31, 2019 , NEER
operates facilities with a total generating capa city of 24,700  MW. NEER produces the majority of its elect ricity from clean and
renewable sources as described more fully below . NEER is the world's largest generator of renew able energy from the wind and sun
based on 2019  MWh produced on a net generation basis. In addition, NEER develops and constructs battery storage projects, which
when combi ned with its renewable projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customer needs  for a nearly firm generation source.
NEER also owns and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities, primarily in Texas and California, and transmission lines that
connect its electric gene ration facilities to the electric grid, which are comprised of approximate ly 190 substations and 1,865 circuit
miles of transmission lines at December 31, 2019 .
NEER also engages in energy-related commod ity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical
contracts, primarily to hedge the production from its generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements.
These contracts primarily include power and gas commodities and their related products, as well as provide full energy and capacity
requirements services primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets and offer customized power and gas and related risk
management services to wholesale customers. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production
through operating and non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure development, construction, management and
operations, through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interes ts, hereafter referred to as the gas
infrastructure business. NEER also hedges the expected output from its gas infrastructure production assets to protect against price
movements.
NEP - NEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable long-term cash flows
through a limited partner  interest in NEP OpCo. NEP's projects include energy projects contribute d by NextEra Energy Resources to
NEP OpCo in connectio n with NEP’ s initial public offering in July 2014 as well as additional energy projects acquired thereafter .
NextEra Energy Resources' indirect limited partnership interest in NEP OpCo based on the number of outstanding NEP OpCo
common units was appro ximately 60.8% at December 31, 2019 . NEP was deconsolidated from NEE for financial reporting purposes
in January 2018 as a result of changes made to NEP's governance structure that enhanced NEP unitholder governance rights. As a
result, NextEra Energy Resources began reflecting its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its
earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accou nting for its asset sales to NEP as
third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 - NextEra Energy Partner s, LP. Prior to the deconsolidation,
NEE owned a controllin g general partner interest in NEP and consolidated NEP. At December 31, 2019 , NEP owned, or had an
interest in, a portfolio of 36 wind and solar proje cts with generating capacity totaling approximate ly 5,331 MW and had membership
interests in contracted natural gas pipelines, all located in the U.S. as further discussed in Generation and Other Operations.
NextEra Energy Resources operates essential ly all of the energy projects in NEP's portfolio and its ownership interest in the
portfolio's generating capacity was approximately 3,240 MW at December 31, 2019 .
GENERATION AND OTHER OPERATIONS
NEER sells products associated with its own generation facilities (energy , capacity , renewable energy credits (RECs) and ancillary
services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. Customer transactions may be supplied from NEER
generation facilities or from purchases in the wholesale markets, or from a combination thereof. See Markets and Competition below .

At December 31, 2019 , NEER managed or participated in the manage ment of essentially all of the following generat ion projects,
natural gas pipelines and transmission facilities that it wholly owned or in which it had an ownership interest.
Generation Assets and Other Operations
12
Table of Contents
Generation Assets.
NEER's portfolio of generation assets primar ily consist of generation facilities with long-term power sales agreements for
substantially all of their capacity and/or energy output. Information related to contracted genera tion assets at December 31, 2019
was as follows:
•represented approximately 19,796  MW of total net generating capacity;
•weighted-average remaining contract term of the power sales agreements and the remaining life of the PTCs associated
with repowe red wind facilities of approximately 16 years, based on forecasted contributions to earnings and forecasted
amounts of electricity produced by the repowered wind facilities; and
•contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel have expiration dates
ranging from March 2020 through 2033 (see Note 15 - Contracts).
NEER's merchant generation assets primarily consist of a nuclear generation facility and oil-fired generation facilities that do not
have long-term power sales agreements to sell their capacity and/or energy output and therefore require active marketing and
hedging. Merchant generation assets at December 31, 2019  represented approximately 2,070  MW of total net generating capacity ,
including 1,102  MW from nuclear generation and 805 MW from oil-fired peak generation facilities, and are primarily located in the
Northeast region of the U.S. NEER utilizes swaps, options, futures and forwards to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price
risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases.
Other Operations.
Gas Infrastructure Business - At December 31, 2019 , NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in natural gas pipelines,

NEER is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is
shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners for the jointly-owned units. NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for
decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. In the case of Duane Arnold, a plan for
decontamination and decommissioning is required to be submitted to the NRC no later than 2 years following shutdown of the
facility .
NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site stora ge pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these
facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through license
expiration or , in the case of Duane Arnold, through expected shutdown of the facility .
Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy
projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs.
Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, wind and solar projects are fully depreciated for tax
purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years.
Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible  to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially
achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the
first ten years of comme rcial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended
several times. Alternatively , an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. Owners of solar
facilities are eligible to claim a 30% ITC for new solar facilities. Previously , owners of solar faciliti es could have elected to receive an
equivalent cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury for the value of the 30% ITC (convertible ITC) for qualifying solar
facilities where construct ion began before the end of 2011 and the facilities were placed in service before 2017. In order to qualify for
the PTC (or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) for wind or ITC for solar , construction of a facility must begin before a specified date and the
taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance stating that the safe harbor for continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements
will generally be satisfied  if the facility is placed in service no more than four years after the year in which construction of the facility
began. The IRS also confirmed that retrofitted wind facilities may re-qualify for PTCs or ITCs pursuant to the 5% safe harbor for the
begin constr uction requi rement, as long as the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the facility’ s total fair value. Tax
credits for qualifying wind and solar projects are subject to the following schedule.

Other countries, including Canada, provide for incentives like feed-in-tarif fs for renewable energy projects. The feed-in-tarif fs
promote renewable energy investments by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost
of generation of each technology .
MARKETS AND COMPETITION
Electricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character . All are extensively regulated, and competition in
these markets is shape d and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of
regulation in each region. Generally , in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may
also face specific constr aints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the
output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity , which can vary from time to time and
can have a significant impact on pricing.
The degree  and nature of competition is different in wholesale markets than in retail markets. During 2019 , 2018  and 2017 ,
approximately 85% of NEER's revenue was derived from wholesale electricity markets.
Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensiv e, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. NEER primarily
competes on the basis of price, but believes the green attributes of NEER's generation assets, its creditworthiness and its ability to
offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power
generation is a regional business that is highly  fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of
industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies
NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means,
including long-term bilateral contracts, standardi zed bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and
risk management services.
In general, U.S. and Canadian electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy , capacity and ancillary services.
Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power
generation asset; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets, such as load regulation and
spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all
regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region.
RTOs and ISOs exist throughout much of North America to coordinate generation and transmis sion across wide geographic areas
and to run markets. NEER operates in all RTO and ISO jurisdictions. At December 31, 2019 , NEER also had generation facilities
with owners hip interests in a total net generatin g capacity of approximately 4,642 MW that fall within reliability regions that are not
under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO, including 2,365 MW within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and
1,252 MW within the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and
structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmiss ion congestion, developing larger
wholesale markets for energy and capacity , maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers.
NEER has operations that fall within the following R TOs and ISOs:
16
Table of Contents
NEER comp etes in different regions to differing degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full
output of its generation facilities. At December 31, 2019 , approximately 90% of NEER's net generat ing capacity was committed
under long-t erm contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets.
In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge
the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges either for physical
delivery or for financial (pricing) offset, serve to protect a portion of the revenue that NEER expects to derive from the associated
generation facility . Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation
facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP  are referred to as “non-qualifying hedges” for adjusted earnings purposes. See
Management's Discussion - Overview - Adjusted Earnings.
Certain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce RECs and other environmental attributes which are
typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately for the wind and solar
generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the
environmental attributes.
While the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in
several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and custo mized power and fuel products and
services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically , the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a
full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk of
fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements.
Expanded competition in a frequently chang ing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER.
Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that
can sell power in comp etitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and
location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities.
NEER REGULATION
The energy markets in which NEER operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation, as the case may be, including local,
state and federal regulation, and other specific rules.
At December 31, 2019 , essentially all of NEER's operating independent power projects located in the U.S. have received exempt
wholesale generator status as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Exempt wholesale generators own
17
Table of Contents
or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail
customers. While projects with exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still
comply with other federa l, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting , construction, operation, licensing,
pollution abatement and other environmental laws.
Additionally , most of the NEER facilities located in the U.S. are subject to FERC regulations and market rules and the NERC's
mandatory reliability standards, all of its facilities are subject to environmental laws and the EPA's environmental regulations, and its
nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. See FPL - FPL Regulation for additional discussion of FERC, NERC,
NRC and EPA regulatio ns. Rates of NEER's rate-regulated transmission businesses are set by regulatory bodies as noted in
Generation and Other Operations - Generation Assets and Other Operations - Other Operations - Rate-Regulated Transmission.
With the exception of facilities located in ERCOT , the FERC has jurisdiction over various aspects of NEER's business in the U.S.,
including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets, regulation of the transmission and sale of natural
gas, and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electric ity policy initiatives. The PUCT  has
jurisdiction, including the regulation of rates and services, oversight of competitive markets, and enforcement of statutes and rules,
over NEER facilities located in ERCOT .
Certain entities within the NEER segment and their affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in
Canada related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and
operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In
Ontario, for example, electricity generation facilit ies must be licensed by the OEB and may also be required to complete registrations
and maintain  market participant status with the IESO, in which case they must agree to be boun d by and comply with the provisions
of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC.
In addition, NEER is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below . In
order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes, NEER continues to actively evaluate and participate in regional market
redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy
commodities.
NEER EMPLOYEES
NEER had approximatel y 5,000 employees at December 31, 2019 . NEER has collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW , the
Utility Workers Union of America, and the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America, which collectively represent
approximately 15% of NEER's employees. The collective bargaining agreements have two- to five-year terms and expire between
March 2021 and September 2022.
GULF POWER
On January 1, 2019, NEE completed the acquis ition of all of the outstanding common shares of Gulf Power under a stock purchase
agreement with The Southern Company dated May 20, 2018, as amended, for approximately $4.44 billion  in cash consideration and
the assumption of appro ximately $1.3 billion of Gulf Power debt. Gulf Power was incorporate d under the laws of Maine in 1925 and
became a Florida corpor ation after being domes ticated under the laws of Florida in 2005. Gulf Power , a rate-regulated electric utility
under the jurisdiction of the FPSC, is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in northwest
Florida. Gulf Power is subject to regulations similar to FPL (see FPL - FPL Regulation above). Gulf Power operates under a base
rate settlement agreement, which took effect July 1, 2017, that provides for an allowed regulatory ROE of 10.25%, with a range of
9.25% to 11.25%. As of December 31, 2019 , Gulf Powe r served approximately 470,000 customers in eight counties throughout
northwest Florida and had approximately  2,300 MW of fossil-fuele d electric net generating  capacity and 9,500  miles of transmission
and distribution lines located primarily in Florida. See Note 8 - Gulf Power Company for further discussion.

NEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
NEE and its subsidiaries , including FPL, are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state and
local environmental statutes, rules and regulatio ns, for the siting, construction and ongoing operations of their facilities. The U.S.
government and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to
take certain actions, such as proposing and finalizing regulations or setting targets or goals, regarding the regulation and reduction
of GHG emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. Numerous environmental regulations also affecting FPL,
NEER, Gulf Power , and certain other subsidiaries relate to threatened and endangered species and/or their habitats,  as well as other
avian and bat species. The environmental laws in the U.S., including, among others, the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, provide for the protection of numer ous species, including endangered
species of birds and bats and/or their habitats, migratory birds and eagles. The environmental laws in Canada, including, among
others, the Species at Risk Act, provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are endangered or threatened and the management
of species of special concern. Complying with these environmental laws and regulations could result in, among other things,
changes in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of
new facilities. Failure to comply could result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions or injunctions. The impact of complying with
current environmental laws and regulations has not had, and, along with compliance with propo sed regulations as currently written,
is not expected to have , a material adverse effect on the financial statements of NEE and FPL. NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries
expect to seek recovery  for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations, which recovery for FPL
and Gulf Power would be through their respective environmental clause.
WEBSITE ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS
NEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K, and any amendments to those repor ts, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www .nexteraenergy .com, as
soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnishe d to the SEC. The information and

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Risks Relating to NEE's and FPL's Business
The busines s, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL are subject to a variety of risks, many of
which are beyond the control of NEE and FPL. These risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known
or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL and may cause actual results of NEE and FPL to differ substantially from those
that NEE or FPL currently expects or seeks. In that event, the market price for the securit ies of NEE or FPL could decline.
Accordingly , the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and
in future reports that NEE and FPL  file with the SEC.
Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks
NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected by
the extensive regulation of their business.
The operatio ns of NEE and FPL are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulation. This extensive
regulatory framework, portions of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulates, among other things
and to varying degrees, NEE's and FPL's industry , businesses, rates and cost structures, operation and licensing of nuclear power
facilities, construction and operation of electricity generation, transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas and oil
production, natural gas, oil and other fuel trans portation, processing and storage facilities, acquisition, disposal, depreciation and
amortization of facilities and other assets, decommissioning costs and funding, service reliability , wholesale and retail competition,
and commodities trading and derivatives transa ctions. In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE
and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a
material adverse ef fect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if
they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable
return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise.
FPL operates as an electric utility and is subject to the jurisdiction of the FPSC over a wide range of business activities, including,
among other items, the retail rates charged to its customers through base rates and cost recovery clauses, the terms and conditions
of its services, procurement of electricity for its customers and fuel for its plant operations, issuances of securities, and aspects of
the siting, construction and operation of its generation plants and transmission and distribution systems for the sale of electric
energy . The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery by FPL of costs that it considers exces sive or imprudently incurred and to
determine the level of return that FPL is permitted to earn on invested capital. The regulatory process, which may be adversely
affected by the political, regulatory and economi c environment in Florida and elsewhere, limits or could otherwise adversely impact
FPL's earnin gs. The regulatory process also does not provide any assurance as to achievem ent of authorized or other earnings
levels, or that FPL will be permitted to earn an acceptable return on capital investments it wishes to make. NEE's and FPL's
business, financial condition, results of operatio ns and prospects could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of
costs, a return on certai n assets or a reasonable return on invested capital cannot be recovered through base rates, cost recovery
clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise. Certain other subsidiaries of NEE are utilities subject to the jurisdiction of their
regulators and are subject to similar risks.
Regulatory decisions that are important to NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by political, regulatory and
economic factors.
The local and national political, regulatory and economic environment has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on
FPSC decisions with negative consequences for FPL. These decisions may require, for example, FPL to cancel or delay planned
development activities, to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures or to pay for inves tments or otherwise incur costs that
it may not be able to recover through rates, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL. Certain other subsidiaries of NEE are subject to similar risks.
FPL's use of derivative instruments could be subject to prudence challenges and, if found imprudent, could result in
disallowances of cost recovery for such use by the FPSC.
The FPSC engages in an annual prudence review of FPL's use of derivative instruments in its risk management fuel procurement
program and should it find any such use to be imprudent, the FPSC could deny cost recovery for such use by FPL. Such an
outcome could have a material adverse ef fect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support utility scale
renewable energy , including, but not limited to, tax laws, policies and incentives, RPS or feed-in tariffs, or the imposition of
additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy , could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory
market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEER abandoning the development of
21
Table of Contents
renewable energy projects, a loss of NEER's investments in renewable energy projects and reduced project returns, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEER depends heavily on government policies that support utility scale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of
developing and operating wind and solar energy projects in regions in which NEER operate s or plans to develop and operate
renewable energy facilities. The federal government, a majority of state governments in the U.S. and portions of Canada provide
incentives, such as tax incentives, RPS or feed-i n tariffs, that support or are designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale
renewable energy facilities, such as wind and solar energy facilities. As a result of budget ary constraints, political factors or
otherwise, governments  from time to time may review their laws and policies that support renewable energy and consider actions
that would make the laws and policies less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities. Any
reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy or the
imposition of additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy , could result in, among other items, the lack of a
satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEER abandoning the development of
renewable energy projects, a loss of NEER's investments in the projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a
material adverse ef fect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's business, financial conditio n, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected
as a result of new or revised laws, regulations, interpretations or ballot or regulatory initiatives.
NEE's and FPL's business is influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives, including, but not limited to, new or revised
laws, including international trade laws, regulations, interpretations or ballot or regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation or
restructuring of the energy industry , regulation of the commodities trading and derivatives markets, and regulation of environmental
matters, such as regula tion of air emissions, regulation of water consumption and water discha rges, and regulation of gas and oil
infrastructure operations, as well as associated environmental permitting. Changes in the nature of the regulation of NEE's and
FPL's business could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. NEE and FPL are unable to predict future legislative or regulatory changes, initiatives or interpretations, although any
such changes, initiatives or interpretations may increase costs and competitive pressures on NEE and FPL, which could have a
material adverse ef fect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
FPL has limited compet ition in the Florida market for retail electricity customers. Any changes  in Florida law or regulation which
introduce competition in the Florida retail electricity market, such as government incentives that facilitate the installation of solar
generation facilities on residential or other rooftops at below cost or that are otherwise subsidized by non-participants, or would
permit third-party sales of electricity , could have a material adverse effect on FPL's busin ess, financial condition, results of
operations and prospec ts. There can be no assurance that FPL will be able to respond adeq uately to such regulatory changes,
which could have a material adverse ef fect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEER is subject to FERC rules related to transmission that are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on
practically a nationwide basis by providing great er certainty , flexibility and more choices to wholesale power customers. NEE cannot
predict the impact of changing FERC rules or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supp ly and demand, which are typically
driven by factors beyon d NEE's control. There can be no assurance that NEER will be able to respond adequately or sufficiently
quickly to such rules and developments, or to any changes that reverse or restrict the competitive restructuring of the energy
industry in those jurisdictions in which such restructuring has occurred. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on
NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE’ s and FPL’s OTC financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act and similar international regulations. NEE and FPL cannot predict the impact any proposed or
not fully implemented final rules will have on their ability to hedge their commodity and intere st rate risks or on OTC derivatives
markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's risk exposure, as well
as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities.
NEE and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and other standards that may result in capital
expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities, and may require NEE and FPL to limit or eliminate certain
operations.
NEE and FPL are subject to domestic environmental laws, regulations and other standards, including, but not limited to, extensive
federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality , water quality and usage, soil quality ,
climate chan ge, emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide, waste management, hazardous
wastes, marine, avian and other wildlife mortality and habitat protection, historical artifact preservation, natural resources, health
(including, but not limited to, electric and magnet ic fields from power lines and substations), safety and RPS, that could, among other
things, preve nt or delay the development of power generation, power or natural gas transmission, or other infrastructure projects,
restrict or enjoin the output of some existing facilities, limit the availability and use of some fuels required for the production of
electricity , require additional pollution control equipment, and otherwise increase costs, increase capital expenditures and limit or
eliminate certain operations. Certain subsidiaries of NEE are also subject to foreign environmental laws, regulations and other
standards and, as such, are subject to similar risks.
22
Table of Contents
There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and
regulations, and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of new requirements and stricter or more
expansive application of existing environmental laws and regulations.
Violations of current or future laws, rules, regulations or other standards could expose NEE and FPL to regulatory and legal
proceedings, disputes with, and legal challenges by, governmental entities and third parties, and potentially significant civil fines,
criminal penalties and other sanctions. Proceedin gs could include, for example, litigation regarding property damage, personal injury ,
common law nuisance and enforcement by citizens or governmental authorities of environmental requirements.
NEE's and FPL's business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulat ions mandating new or additional
limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions.
Federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse
gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, from electric generation units using fossil fuels like coal and natural
gas. The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on NEE's and FPL's electric gener ation units are subject to significant
uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of
emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative
availability of greenhous e gas emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-ef fective, commercial-scale carbon capture and
storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, and the range of available compliance alternatives.
While NEE's and FPL's electric generation units emit greenhouse gases at a lower rate of emissions than most of the U.S. electric
generation sector , the results of operations of NEE and FPL could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or
state laws or regulations impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits. Any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could:
•create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances;
•make some of NEE's and FPL's electric generation units uneconomical to operate in the long term;
•require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology , fuel switching, or the replacement of high-
emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting generation facilities; or
•affect the availability or cost of fossil fuels.
There can be no assurance that NEE or FPL would be able to completely recover any such costs or investments, which could have a
material adverse ef fect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Extensive federal regulation of the operations and businesses of NEE and FPL exposes NEE and FPL to significant and
increasing compliance costs and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions for
compliance failures.
NEE's and FPL's operations and businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation, which generally imposes significant and
increasing compliance costs on their operations and businesses. Additionally , any actual or alleged compliance failures could result
in significant costs and other potentially adverse effects of regulatory investigations, proceedings, settlements, decisions and claims,
including, among other items, potentially significant monetary penalties. As an example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, NEE
and FPL, as owners and operators of bulk-powe r transmission systems and/or electric generation facilities, are subject to mandatory
reliability standards. Compliance with these mandatory reliability standards may subject NEE and FPL to higher operating costs and
may result in increased capital expenditures. If FPL or NEE is found not to be in compliance with these standards, they may incur
substantial monetary penalties and other sanctio ns. Both the costs of regulatory compliance and the costs that may be imposed as a
result of any actual or alleged compliance failures could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.
Changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including but not limited to changes in corpo rate income tax rates, as well as
judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely
affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's provisi on for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities require significant judgments and the
use of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimat es of the timing and probability of
recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding
tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of, among other things,
changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including changes in corporate income tax rates, the financial condition and results of
operations of NEE and FPL, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. These factors, including the ultimate
resolution of income tax matters, may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially
adversely af fect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
23
Table of Contents
NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected
due to adverse results of litigation.
NEE's and FPL's busine ss, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be mate rially affected by adverse results of
litigation. Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings in which NEE or FPL is involved or other future legal proceedings may have a
material adverse ef fect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.
Development and Operational Risks
NEE's and FPL's busin ess, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer if NEE and FPL do not
proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to,
electric generation, transmission and distrib ution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or
within budget.
NEE's and FPL's ability to proceed with projects under development and to complete construction of, and capital improvement
projects for, their electr ic generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructu re facilities and other facilities on
schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance,
inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses, rights-of-way , permits or other approvals on acceptable terms or on schedule,
disputes involving contra ctors, labor organizations, land owners, governmental entities, environmental groups, Native American and
aboriginal groups, lessors, joint venture partners  and other third parties, negative publicity , transmission interconnection issues and
other factors . If any development project or cons truction or capital improvement project is not completed, is delayed or is subject to
cost overruns, certain associated costs may not be approved for recovery or otherwise be recoverable through regulatory
mechanisms that may be available, and NEE and FPL could become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become
obligated for other damages under contracts, could experience the loss of tax credits or tax incentives, or delayed or diminished
returns, and could be required to write off all or a portion of their investment in the project. Any of these events could have a material
adverse ef fect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE and FPL face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the
negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.
NEE and FPL own, develop, construct, manage and operate electric-generation and trans mission facilities and natural gas
transmission facilities. A key component of NEE's and FPL's growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and
transmission facilities to meet customer needs. As part of these operations, NEE and FPL must periodically apply for licenses and
permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should NEE or
FPL be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such
licenses or permits, shou ld there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities
initiate any associated investigations or enforce ment actions or impose related penalties or disallowances on NEE or FPL, NEE's
and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materiall y adversely affected. Any failure to
negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar results.
The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas
infrastructure facilities, retail gas distribution system in Florida and other facilities are subject to many operational risks,
the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmissio n and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities, retail gas distribution system
in Florida and other facilities are subject to many operational risks. Operational risks could result in, among other things, lost
revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures or legal claims,
liability to third parties for property and persona l injury damage or loss of life, a failure to perform under applicable power sales
agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated damages
under continuing agreements, and replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at
higher prices.
Uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining NEE's and FPL's facilities include, but are not limited to:
•risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on
schedule and otherwise as planned;
•failures in the availability , acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies;
•the impact of unusual or adverse weather cond itions and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes,
icing events, floods, earthquakes and droughts;
•performance below expected or contracted levels of output or ef ficiency;
•breakdown or failure, including, but not limited to, explosions, fires, leaks or other major event s, of equipment, transmission or
distribution systems or pipelines;
•availability of replacement equipment;
24
Table of Contents
•risks of property damage , human injury or loss of life from energized equipment, hazardous subs tances or explosions, fires, leaks
or other events, especially where facilities are located near populated areas;
•potential environmental impacts of gas infrastructure operations;
•availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements;
•inability to identify , manage properly or mitigate equipment defects in NEE's and FPL's facilities;
•use of new or unproven technology;
•risks associa ted with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source, such as commodity price risk, availability of adequate
fuel supply and transportation, and lack of available alternative fuel sources;
•increased competition due to, among other factors, new facilities, excess supply , shifting demand and regulatory changes; and
•insuf ficient insurance, warranties or performance guarantees to cover any or all lost revenues or increased expenses from the
foregoing.
NEE's and FPL's busin ess, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be negatively affected by a lack of
growth or slower growth in the number of customers or in customer usage.
Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence the dema nd for electricity and the need for
additional power generation and power delivery facilities, as well as the need for energy-related  commodities such as natural gas.
Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of NEE and FPL, such as mandated
energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic conditions, such as
population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity . A lack
of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity or natural gas and other fuels may cause
NEE and FPL to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material
adverse ef fect on NEE's and FPL's growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by
weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather .
Weather conditions directly influence the deman d for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and
energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events
and earthquakes, can be destructive and cause  power outages and property damage, reduce revenue, affect the availability of fuel
and water, and require NEE and FPL to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain
replacement power and to access available financing sources. Furthermore, NEE's and FPL's physical plants could be placed at
greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns,
resulting in more intense , frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation  and, particularly relevant to FPL, a
change in sea level. FPL operates in the east and lower west coasts of Florida and Gulf Power operates in northwest Florida, areas
that historically have been prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes. A disruption or failure of electric generation,
transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a
hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent NEE and FPL from operating their business in the
normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse ef fect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
At FPL and other businesses of NEE where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged
facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of
the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.
Changes in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, NEER's
wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because
the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, NEER's results of operations for individual wind and solar
facilities specifically , and NEE's results of operations generally , may vary significantly from perio d to period, depending on the level
of available resources. To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the finan cial results from these facilities may
be less than expected.
Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events  that could result from terrorism, cyberattacks, or individuals and/or groups
attempting to disrupt NEE's and FPL's busin ess, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect NEE's
and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE and FPL are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as
cyberattacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. There have been cyberattacks within the energy industry on
energy infras tructure such as substations, gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there  may be such attacks in the future.
NEE's and FPL's genera tion, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other
infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely af fected by , such activities.
Terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events affecting NEE's and FPL's systems and facilitie s, or those of third parties on which
NEE and FPL  rely, could harm NEE's and FPL's business, for example, by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or
25
Table of Contents
transmit power , natural gas or other energy-rela ted commodities, by limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process
payments, and by delaying their development and construction of new generation, distribution or transmission facilities or capital
improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in
revenues, significant additional costs (for exam ple, to repair assets, implement additional security requirements or maintain or
acquire insurance), significant fines and penalt ies, and reputational damage, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's
operations (for example, by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels), and could impair
NEE's and FPL's ability to raise capital (for exam ple, by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity). In addition,
the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.
Such events  or actions may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.
The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially
adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial
condition of insurers. NEE's and FPL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses.
Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rates or on terms  similar to those presently available
to NEE and FPL. The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be
materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial
condition of insurers. If insurance coverage is not available or obtainable on acceptable terms, NEE or FPL may be required to pay
costs associated with adverse future events. NEE and FPL generally are not fully insured against all significant losses. For example,
FPL is not fully insured against hurricane-related  losses, but could instead seek recovery of such uninsured losses from customers
subject to approval by the FPSC, to the extent losses exceed restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage. A loss for
which NEE or FPL is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.
NEE invests in gas and oil producing and transmission assets through NEER’ s gas infrastructure business. The gas
infrastructure business is exposed to fluctu ating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy
commodities. A prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NEER’ s gas infrastructure business and cause
NEER to delay or canc el certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired, which
could materially adversely affect NEE's results of operations.
Natural gas and oil prices are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally . Factors that influence supply and
demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather , political instability , conflicts, new discoveries, technological advances,
economic conditions and actions by major oil-pro ducing countries. There can be significant volatility in market prices for gas and oil,
and price fluctuations could have a material effect on the financial performance of gas and oil producing and transmission assets.
For example, in a low gas and oil price environment, NEER would generate less revenue from its gas infrastructure investments in
gas and oil producing properties, and as a result certain investments might become less profitable or incur losses. Prolonged periods
of low oil and gas price s could also result in the delay or cancellation of oil and gas production and transmission projects, could
cause projec ts to experience lower returns, and could result in certain projects becoming impaire d, which could materially adversely
affect NEE's results of operations.
If supply costs necessary to provide NEER's full energy and capacity requirement services are not favorable, operating
costs could increase and materially adver sely affect NEE's business, financial cond ition, results of operations and
prospects.
NEER provid es full energy and capacity requirements  services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services
and various ancillary services, to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities' power supply obligations to their customers. The supply
costs for these transacti ons may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, events that may occur after such
utilities have  committed to supply power , such as weather conditions, fluctuating prices for energy and ancillary services, and the
ability of the distribution utilities' customers to elect to receive service from competing suppliers. NEER may not be able to recover all
of its increased supply costs, which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.
Due to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy
commodities, NEER's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolios
could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
There can be significant volatility in market price s for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities. NEE's inability or
failure to manage properly or hedge effectively its assets or positions against changes in commo dity prices, volumes, interest rates,
counterparty credit risk or other risk measures, based on factors that are either within, or wholly or partially outside of, NEE's control,
may materially adversely af fect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Reductions in the liquidity of energy markets may restrict the ability of NEE to manage its operational risks, which, in turn,
could negatively affect NEE's results of operations.
NEE is an active partici pant in energy markets.  The liquidity of regional energy markets is an important factor in NEE's ability to
manage risks in these operations. Market liquidity is driven in part by the number of active marke t participants. Liquidity in the energy
markets can be adverse ly affected by price volatility , restrictions on the availability of credit and other factors, and any reduction in
the liquidity of energy markets could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.
NEE's and FPL's hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools may not protect against
significant losses.
NEE and FPL have hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools, such as separate but complementary
financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, manag ement review processes and other
mechanisms. NEE and FPL are unable to assure that such procedures and tools will be effective against all potential risks, including,
without limita tion, emplo yee misconduct. If such procedures and tools are not effective, this could have a material adverse effect on
NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
If price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior , NEE's and FPL's risk management tools
associated with their hedging and trading procedures may not protect against significant losses.
NEE's and FPL's risk management tools and metrics associated with their hedging and trading procedures, such as daily value at
risk, earnings at risk, stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines, are based on historical price  movements. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing behavior , NEE and FPL are unable to assure
that their risk management tools and metrics will be effective to protect against material adverse effects on their business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.
If power transmission or natural gas, nuclear fuel or other commodity transportation facilities are unavailable or disrupted,
the ability for subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, to sell and deliver power or natural gas may be limited.
Subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, depend upon power transmission and natural gas, nuclear fuel and other commodity
transportation facilities, many of which they do not own. Occurrences affecting the operation of these facilities that may or may not
be beyond the control of subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, (such as severe weather or a generation or transmission facility outage,
pipeline rupture, or sudden and significant incre ase or decrease in wind generation) may limit or halt their ability to sell and deliver
power and natural gas, or to purchase necessary fuels and other commodities, which could materially adversely impact NEE's and
FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE and FPL  are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors.
NEE and FPL are expos ed to risks associated with the creditworthiness and performance of their customers, hedging counterparties
and vendors under contracts for the supply of equipment, materials, fuel and other goods and services required for their business
operations and for the construction and operation of, and for capital improvements to, their facilities. Adverse conditions in the
energy industry or the general economy , as well as circumstances of individual customers, hedgi ng counterparties and vendors, may
adversely affect the ability of some customers, hedging counterparties and vendors to perform as required under their contracts with
NEE and FPL.
If any hedging, vending or other counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations, NEE and FPL may need to make arrangements
with other counterparties or vendors, which could result in material financial losses, higher costs, untimely completion of power
generation facilities and other projects, and/or a disruption of their operations. If a defaultin g counterparty is in poor financial
condition, NEE and FPL  may not be able to recover damages for any contract breach.
NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses or a reduction in operating cash flows if a counterparty fails to perform or
make payments in accordance with the terms of derivative contracts or if NEE or FPL is required to post margin cash
collateral under derivative contracts.
NEE and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, some of which are traded in the OTC
markets or on exchange s, to manage their commodity and financial market risks, and for NEE to engage in trading and marketing
activities. Any failures by their counterparties to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of those transactions could
have a material adverse  effect on NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly , any
requirement for FPL or NEE to post margin cash collateral under its derivative contracts could have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition, results of operation s and prospects. These risks may be increased during periods of adverse market or
economic conditions af fecting the industry in which NEE and FPL  participate.

NEE and FPL are highl y dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of
those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.
NEE and FPL operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology
systems and network infrastructure. Despite NEE's and FPL's implementation of security measures, all of their technology systems
are vulnerable to disability , failures or unauthorized access due to such activities. If NEE's or FPL's information technology systems
were to fail or be breached, sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised and NEE and FPL could be unable to fulfill
critical business functions.
NEE's and FPL's busine ss is highly dependent on their ability to process and monitor , on a daily basis, a very large number of
transactions, many of which are highly complex  and cross numerous and diverse markets. Due to the size, scope, complexity and
geographical reach of NEE's and FPL's business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep
track of and process information is critical and challenging. NEE's and FPL's operating system s and facilities may fail to operate
properly or become disabled as a result of events that are either within, or wholly or partially outside of, their control, such as
operator error, severe weather , terrorist activitie s or cyber incidents. Any such failure or disabling event could materially adversely
affect NEE's  and FPL's ability to process transactions and provide services, and their business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.
NEE and FPL add, modify and replace information systems on a regular basis. Modifying existing information systems or
implementing new or replacement information systems is costly and involves risks, including , but not limited to, integrating the
modified, new or replacement system with existing systems and processes, implementing associated changes in accounting
procedures and controls, and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing
information systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems, could
result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of managem ent's and employees' attention and
resources, and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the companies' control environment, and/or the companies' ability to
timely file required regulatory reports.
NEE and FPL also face the risks of operational failure or capacity constraints of third parties, including, but not limited to, those who
provide power transmission and natural gas transportation services.
NEE's and FPL's retail businesses are subjec t to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could
result in a material adverse impact to their reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.
NEE's and FPL's retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. NEE's and
FPL's retail businesses may also need to provid e sensitive customer data to vendors and servi ce providers who require access to
this information in order  to provide services, such as call center services, to the retail businesses. If a significant breach occurred,
the reputatio n of NEE and FPL could be materially adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, or customer
information could be subject to identity theft. NEE and FPL would be subject to costs associated with the breach and/or NEE and
FPL could be subject to fines and legal claims, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.
NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and
limited liquidity in OTC markets.
NEE and FPL execute transactions in derivative instruments on either recognized exchanges or via the OTC markets, depending on
management's assessment of the most favorable credit and market execution factors. Transactions executed in OTC markets have
the potential  for greater volatility and less liquidity than transactions on recognized exchanges. As a result, NEE and FPL may not be
able to execute desired OTC transactions due to such heightened volatility and limited liquidity .
In the absence of activel y quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of derivative instruments
involves management's judgment and use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative
valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments and have a material adverse effect on NEE's
and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE and FPL  may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity .
From time to time, political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse
public statem ents affecting NEE and FPL. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political
or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enfor cement officials or in legal claims.
Responding to these investigations and lawsuits , regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort
of senior management from NEE's and FPL's business.
28
Table of Contents
Addressing any adverse publicity , governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and
expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negati ve impact on the reputation of NEE
and FPL, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with regulators. It may also have a negative
impact on their ability to take timely advantage  of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of
negative publicity , and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's busin ess, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if they are
unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in
Florida.
Subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide
electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a
very substantial portion of the subsidiary's revenues. If they are unable to maintain, negot iate or renegotiate such franchise
agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and they may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from
significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's business, financial conditio n, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected
by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.
Employee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers. Personnel costs may
also increase due to inflationary or competitive pressures on payroll and benefits costs and revised terms of collective bargaining
agreements with union employees. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's ability to successfully identify , complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not
limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry .
NEE is likely to encou nter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the
consolidation of the energy industry in general.  In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at
favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner .
Nuclear Generation Risks
The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial
risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.
NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to,
those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage  and emissions of tritium and other
radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other
potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and
external insurance coverage which are intende d to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however , the cost of
decommissioning nuclea r generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds, and
the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If NEE or FPL is unable to recover
the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely af fected.
In the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe,
NEE and FPL could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrosp ective insurance premiums as a
result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.
Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor
owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance
with this Act, NEE maintains the maximum amount of private liability insurance obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial
protection system, which provides liability insura nce coverage for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary
financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments and/or retrospect ive insurance premiums, plus any
applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of
fault or proximity to the incident. Such assessments, if levied, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.
NRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by
the NRC could require  NEE and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expendi tures at their nuclear generation
facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.
29
Table of Contents
The NRC has broad authority to impose licens ing and safety-related requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear
generation facilities, the addition of capacity at existing nuclear generation facilities and the construction of new nuclear generation
facilities, and these requirements are subject to change. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines
and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility , depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved. Any of the foregoing events could require NEE and FPL to incur increased costs and capital expenditures,
and could reduce revenues.
Any serious nuclear incident occurring at a NEE or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses. A
major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any
domestic nuclear generation facility . An inciden t at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world also could cause the NRC to impose
additional conditions or other requirements on the industry , or on certain types of nuclear generation units, which could increase
costs, reduce revenues and result in additional capital expenditures.
The inability to operat e any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating
licenses, or in the case of Duane Arnold through expected shutdown, could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and
FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
If any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating
licenses, or in the case of Duane Arnold through expected shutdown, NEE or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates,
incur impairm ent charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, any of which could materially adversely affect their
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodical ly removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance
outages, and for other  purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE's
and FPL's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
NEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages,
including, but not limited to, inspections, repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment. In the event that a
scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to, for example, equipment failure, such
outages could materially adversely af fect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks
Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NEE's
and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also materially
adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NEE and FPL.
NEE and FPL rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other
operations requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit
markets could increase NEE's and FPL's cost of capital and affect their ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet
their growth objectives. If NEE or FPL is unable to access regularly the capital and credit markets on terms that are reasonable, it
may have to delay raising capital, issue short er-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could
adversely affect its ability to grow its business, could contribute to lower earnings and reduced financial flexibility , and could have a
material adverse ef fect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Although NEE's competitive energy and certain  other subsidiaries have used non-recourse or limited-recourse, project-specific or
other financing in the past, market conditions and other factors could adversely affect the future availability of such financing. The
inability of NEE's subsid iaries, including, without limitation, NEECH and its subsidiaries, to access the capital and credit markets to
provide project-specific or other financing for electric generation or other facilities or acquisitions on favorable terms, whether
because of disruptions or volatility in those markets or otherwise, could necessitate additional capital raising or borrowings by NEE
and/or NEECH in the future.
The inability of subsidiar ies that have existing project-specific or other financing arrangements to meet the requirements of various
agreements relating to those financings, as well as actions by third parties or lenders, could give rise to a project-specific financing
default which, if not cured or waived, might result in the specific project, and potentially in some limited instances its parent
companies, being required to repay the asso ciated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such
repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to forec lose against the project assets and
related collateral. Such an occurrence also could  result in NEE expending additional funds or incurring additional obligations over the
shorter term to ensure continuing compliance  with project-specific financing arrangements based upon the expectation of
improvement in the proje ct's performance or financial returns over the longer term. Any of these actions could materially adversely
affect NEE's business, financial condition, results  of operations and prospects, as well as the availability or terms of future financings
for NEE or its subsidiaries.

Table of Contents
NEE's, NEECH's and FPL's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's
liquidity and results of operations, limit the ability of NEE and FPL  to grow their business, and increase interest costs.
The inability  of NEE, NEECH and FPL to maintain their current credit ratings could materially adversely affect their ability to raise
capital or obtain credit on favorable terms, which, in turn, could impact NEE's and FPL's ability to grow their business and service
indebtedness and repay borrowings, and would likely increase their interest costs. In addition, certain agreements and guarantee
arrangements would require posting of additional collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade. Some of the factors that can affect
credit ratings are cash flows, liquidity , the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization, NEE's overall business mix and
political, legislative and regulatory actions. There  can be no assurance that one or more of the ratings of NEE, NEECH and FPL will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency .
NEE's and FPL's liquidity may be impaired if their credit providers are unable to fund their credit commitments to the
companies or to maintain their current credit ratings.
The inability of NEE's, NEECH's and FPL's credit providers to fund their credit commitments or to maintain their current credit ratings
could requir e NEE, NEECH or FPL, among other things, to renegotiate requirements in agreements, find an alternative credit
provider with acceptable credit ratings to meet funding requirements, or post cash collateral and could have a material adverse effect
on NEE's and FPL's liquidity .
Poor market performance and other economic factors could affect NEE's defined benefit pension plan's funded status,
which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations
and prospects.
NEE sponsors a qualifie d noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. A
decline in the market value of the assets held in the defined benefit pension plan due to poor investment performance or other
factors may increase the funding requirements for this obligation.
NEE's defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to changes in interest rates, since as interest rates decrease, the funding liabilities
increase, potentially increasing benefits costs and funding requirements. Any increase in benefits costs or funding requirements may
have a material adverse ef fect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity , results of operations and prospects.
Poor market performance and other econom ic factors could adversely affect the asset values of NEE's and FPL's nuclear
decommissioning funds, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity , financial condition and results of
operations.
NEE and FPL are required to maintain decommis sioning funds to satisfy their future obligations to decommission their nuclear power
plants. A decline in the market value of the assets held in the decommissioning funds due to poor investment performance or other
factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations. Any increase in funding requirements may have a material
adverse ef fect on NEE's and FPL's liquidity , financial condition and results of operations.
Certain of NEE's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, whic h may materially adversely affect
NEE's liquidity , financial condition and results of operations.
NEE holds certain investments where changes in the fair value affect NEE's financial results. In some cases there may be no
observable market values for these investments , requiring fair value estimates to be based on other valuation techniques. This type
of analysis requires significant judgment and the actual values realized in a sale of these investments could differ materially from
those estima ted. A sale of an investment below previously estimated value, or other decline in the fair value of an investment, could
result in losses or the write-of f of such investment, and may have a material adverse effect on NEE's liquidity , financial condition and
results of operations.
NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its
subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NEE.
NEE is a holding company and, as such, has no material operations of its own. Substantially all of NEE's consolidated assets are
held by its subsidiaries . NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, its guarantees, and to pay
dividends on its common stock is primarily depen dent on its subsidiaries' net income and cash flows, which are subject to the risks of
their respective businesses, and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE.
NEE's subs idiaries are separate legal entities and have no independent obligation to provide NEE with funds for its payment
obligations. The subsidiaries have financial obligations, including, but not limited to, payment of debt service, which they must satisfy
before they can provide  NEE with funds. In addition, in the event of a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization, NEE's right to
participate in a distribution of assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.
The dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding
financing agreements and which may be included in future financing agreements. The future enactment of laws or regulations also
may prohibit or restrict the ability of NEE's subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds.
31
Table of Contents
NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if NEE
is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.
NEE guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than FPL, through guarantee agreements with
NEECH. These guarantees may require NEE to provide substantial funds to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a
time when NEE is in need of liquidity to meet its own financial obligations. Funding such guarant ees may materially adversely affect
NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations or to pay dividends.
NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse
effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NEE’ s limited partner interest in NEP  OpCo.
Through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary , NEE owns a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo.  NEP's inability to access capital on
commercially reasonable terms and effectively consummate future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on NEP's ability
to grow its cash distribut ions to its common unitholders, including NEE, and on the value of NEE’ s limited partnership interest in NEP
OpCo. In addition, NEP's issuance of additional common units, securities convertible into NEP common units or other securities in
connection with acquisitions could cause significant common unitholder dilution and reduce  cash distributions to its common
unitholders, including NEE, if the acquisitions are not suf ficiently accretive.
Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of
NEE's common stock.
The market price and trading volume of NEE's common stock are subject to fluctuations as a result of, among other factors, general
credit and capital market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding the operations, business and financing strategies of
NEE and its subsidiaries . As a result, disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may, for example, have a
material adverse ef fect on the market price of NEE's common stock.

See Item 1. Business - FPL  and Item 1. Business - NEER for a description of principal properties.
Character of Ownership
Substantially all of FPL's  properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by FPL.
The majority of FPL's real property is held in fee and is free from other encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions which are not of a
nature as to substantially impair the usefulness to FPL of such properties. Some of FPL's electric lines are located on parcels of land
which are not owned in fee by FPL but are covered by necessary consents of governmental  authorities or rights obtained from
owners of private proper ty. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment have ownership interests in entities that own generation facilities,
pipeline facilities and transmission assets and a number of those facilities and assets are encumbered by liens securing various
financings. Additionally , the majority of NEER's generation facilities, pipeline facilities and transmission lines are located on land
under easement or leased from owners of private property . See Note 1 - Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization.

Securities
Common Stock Data. All of FPL's common stock is owned by NEE. NEE's common stock is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "NEE." As of the close of business on January 31, 2020, there were 16,776 holders of record of NEE's
common stock. The amount and timing of dividends payable on NEE's common stock are within  the sole discretion of NEE's Board
of Directors. The Boar d of Directors reviews  the dividend rate at least annually (genera lly in February) to determine its
appropriateness in light of NEE's financial position and results of operations, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the
electric utility industry in general and FPL in particular , competitive conditions, change in busin ess mix and any other factors the
Board of Directors deem s relevant. In February 2020, NEE announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common
stock from $1.25 per share to $1.40 per share.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
OVERVIEW
NEE’ s operating performance is driven primarily  by the operations of its two principal businesses, FPL, which serves more than five
million  customer accounts in Florida and is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., and NEER,  which together with affiliated
entities is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2019  MWh produced on a net
generation basis. The table below presents net income (loss)  attributable to NEE and earnings (loss) per share attributable to NEE,
assuming dilution, by reportable segment, FPL and NEER, as well as Gulf Power , acquired in January 2019 (see Note 8 - Gulf
Power Company ) and Corporate and Other , which is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well
as other income and expense items, including  interest expense, and eliminating entries. See Note 16 for additiona l segment
information, including a discussion of a change in segment reporting. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein and all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year.
Certain  2018  and 2017  segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted as discussed in Note 16.

Table of Contents
Adjusted Earnings
NEE prepares its financ ial statements under GAAP. However , management uses earnings adjusted for certain items (adjusted
earnings), a non-GAAP  financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the Board
of Directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE’ s employee incentive compensation plans.
NEE also uses adjusted  earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outloo k to analysts and investors.  NEE’s
management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NEE's fundamental earnings power .
Although these amounts  are properly included  in the determination of net income under GAAP , management believes that the
amount and/or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted
earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared under GAAP .
The following table provides details of the after-tax adjustments to net income considered in computing NEE's adjusted earnings
discussed above.

(a)For 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately $63 million of losses, $41 million of gains, and $46 million of gains, respectively, are included in NEER's net income; the
balance is included in Corporate and Other. The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices,
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying
transactions were realized. In 2017, net losses associated with non-qualifying hedge activity were partly offset by approximately $95 million of tax reform impacts.
(b)For 2019, approximately $89 million related to the impact of tax rate change on differential membership interests relates to NEER. For 2018, approximately $421
million of favorable tax reform-related impacts, including the impact of tax rate change on differential membership interests, relates to NEER and the balance relates
to Corporate and Other. For 2017, approximately $1,929 million of net favorable tax reform impacts and $50 million of net unfavorable tax reform impacts relate to
NEER and FPL, respectively; the balance relates to Corporate and Other. See Note 1 - Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery and - Sales of
Differential Membership Interests and Note 6.
(c)For 2019 and 2018, approximately $96 million and $2,885 million, respectively, relates to NEER; the 2018 balance relates to Corporate and Other. See Note 1 -
NextEra Energy Partners, LP and - Disposal of Businesses/Assets.
(d)For 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately $176 million of gains, $127 million of losses, and $2 million of gains, respectively, are included in NEER's net income; the
balance for 2018 is included in Corporate and Other.
(e)For 2019, approximately $44 million, $20 million and $6 million of costs are included in Corporate and Other's, Gulf Power's and NEER's net income, respectively.
For 2018, $9 million of costs are included in Corporate and Other's net income; the balance is included in NEER. For 2017, the costs relate to Corporate and Other.
See Note 1 - Acquisition-Related.
(f)See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets for a discussion of the sale of the fiber-optic telecommunications business.
(g)Approximately $246 million of the impairment charge is included in NEER's net income; the balance is included in Corporate and Other. See Note 5 - Nonrecurring
Fair Value Measurements.
NEE segregates into two categories unrealiz ed mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative
transactions. The first category , referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative
and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or
for which hedge accoun ting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are
marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset
to certain of the position s are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in
one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy
derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions  in the portfolio or contracts, which
are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the
non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category , referred to as trading
activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take
advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. At FPL, substantially all changes in the
fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon
settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 4.

Table of Contents
2019 Summary
Net income attributable to NEE for 2019  was lower than 2018  by $2,869 millio n, or $6.12  per share, assuming dilution, due to lower
results at NEER and Corporate and Other , partly of fset by higher results at FPL  and the addition of results from Gulf Power .
FPL's increase in net income in 2019  was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property .
NEER's results decreased in 2019  primarily reflecting the absence of the 2018 NEP investment gains upon deconsolidation and the
favorable adjustment to differential membership interests recognized in 2018  relate d to the decrease in federal corporate income tax
rate effective  January 1, 2018 . These decreases were  partly offset by 2019 net unrealized gains on equity securities held in NEER's
nuclear decommissioning funds compared to net unrealized losses in 2018 and higher contributions from new investments. In 2019 ,
NEER added approximately 1,125  MW of new wind genera ting capacity , 1,091  MW of wind repowering generating capacity and 512
MW of solar generating capacity in the U.S. and increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects.
During 2019, Gulf Power contributed $180 million  of net income attributable to NEE.
Corporate and Other's results in 2019  decreased primarily due to higher interest costs, unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity , as
well as acquisition and integration costs incurred in 2019.
NEE and its subsidiaries  require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flows from
operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt, proceeds from differential membership investors, sales of assets
to NEP  or third parties and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity .
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net income attributable to NEE for 2019  was $3.77 billion  compared to $6.64 billion  in 2018 . In 2019 , net income  attributable to NEE
declined primarily due to lower results at NEER and Corporate and Other , partly offset by higher result s at FPL and the addition of
results from Gulf Power . The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended Decem ber 31, 2018  and 2017  are included
in Management's Discussion in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In June 2019, subsidiaries within the NEER segment sold ownership interests in three wind generation facilities and three solar
generation facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately 611 MW to a subsidiar y of NEP. See Note 1 - Disposal of
Businesses/Assets.
In July 2019 , a wholly owned subsidiary of NEET  acquired the outstanding membership interests of an entity that indirectly owns
Trans Bay, which owns and operates a 53-mile, high-voltage direct current underwater transmiss ion cable system in California. See
Note 8 - Trans Bay Cable, LLC.
NEE's effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approx imately 12% and 21%, respectively .
The decreas e in the rate primarily reflects the amortization of deferred regulatory credits, primarily at FPL, the impact of higher tax
credits, an adjustment related to dif ferential membership interests and lower pre-tax income. See Note 6.
FPL: Results of Operations
FPL obtains its operating  revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the FPSC through
base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms. FPL’s net income for 2019  and 2018  was $2,334 million  and $2,171 million ,
respectively , representing an increase of $163 million . The increase was primarily driven by higher earnings from investments in
plant in service and other property . Such investments grew  FPL's average retail rate base by approximately $3.3 billion in 2019  and
reflect, among other things, solar generation additions, ongoing transmission and distribution additions and investments in FPL's
generation infrastructure , including the Okeech obee Clean Energy Center , which achieved commercial operation during the first
quarter of 2019.
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma passed through Florida causing damage throughout much of FPL's service territory . In
December 2017, following the enactment of tax reform, FPL used available reserve amortizat ion to offset nearly all of the storm
restoration costs that were expensed, and FPL is partially restoring the reserve amortization through tax savings generated during
the term of the 2016 rate agreement. In Septem ber 2019, FPL’s service territory was impacted by Hurricane Dorian. In December
2019, FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Dorian through a storm
surcharge from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE’ s and FPL’s consolidated statements
of income. All of the Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs were offset by utilization of available reserve amortization resulting
from operational ef ficiencies generated at the business. See Note 1 - Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery .
The use of reserve amortization is permitted by the 2016 rate agreement. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL
Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory
ROE, subjec t to limitations associated with the 2016 rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-
month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net
37
Table of Contents
operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and
amortization, interest and tax expenses. In gener al, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by
reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortizat ion is reversed so as not to exceed
the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of FPL's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include
wholesale and transmission service revenues and expenses, cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, AFUDC - equity and
revenue and costs not recoverable from retail customers by the FPSC. In 2019  and 2018 , FPL recorded the reversal of reserve
amortization of approximately $357 million and $541 million, respectively . FPL's regulatory ROE for both 2019  and 2018  was
approximately 11.60%.
During 2019 , FPL's operating revenu es increased $330  million primarily related to higher retail base revenues of $323 million, higher
revenues of $60 million as a result of the acquisition of the entity that operates Florida City Gas in July 2018 and other increases
associated with various cost recovery clause revenues, partly of fset by $78 million in lower storm-related revenues.
Retail Base
FPL’s retail base revenues for 2019  and 2018  reflec t the 2016 rate agreement. In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order
approving the 2016 rate agreement which became effective January 2017 and will remain in effect until at least December 2020,
establishes FPL's allowe d regulatory ROE at 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%, and allowed for retail rate base increases in
2017, 2018, and upon commencement of commercial operations at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and certain solar projects.
See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates for additional information on the 2016 rate
agreement.
The increas e in retail base revenues in 2019  primarily reflects additio nal revenues of approximately $210 million related to retail
base rate increases associated with the Okeech obee Clean Energy Center and the 2019 addition of new solar generation. In 2019 ,
retail base revenues were also impacted by a decrease of 0.3% in the average usage per retail customer and an increase of 2.0% in
the average  number of customer accounts. Although the weather in 2019  was favorable when compared to 2018 , usage per retail
customer decreased slightly . See Note 1 - Rate Regulation.
Cost Recovery Clauses
Revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass-through costs, such as franchi se fees, revenue taxes and storm-
related surch arges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered
through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets, primarily related to certain solar and environmental projects and the
unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with FPL's acquisition of certain generat ion facilities. See Item 1. Business -
FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery
clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and
FPL's opera ting cash flows. The 2019  net overrec overy impac ting NEE and FPL's operating cash flows was approximately $188
million.
Storm-related revenues decreased in 2019  prima rily as a result of the conclusion of the storm-recovery bond surcharge in the third
quarter of 2019. See Note 9 - FPL.
In 2019  and 2018 , cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $117 million and $113 million, respectively , to FPL ’s net income.
Other Items Impacting FPL's Consolidated Statements of Income
Storm Restoration Costs
In December 2019, FPL determined that it would  not seek recovery of Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs through a surcharge
from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE’ s and FPL’s consolidated statements of income.
See Note 1 - Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery .
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
The major components of FPL ’s depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:
 Years Ended December 31,
 2019  2018
 (millions)
Reserve reversal recorded under the 2016 rate agreement $ 357  $ 541
Other depreciation and amortization recovered under base rates (excluding reserve amortization) and other 1,876  1,739
Depreciation and amortization primarily recovered under cost recovery clauses and securitized storm-
recovery cost amortization 291  353
Total $ 2,524  $ 2,633
38
Table of Contents
Depreciation expense decreased $109  million during 2019  primarily reflecting a lower reversal of reserve amortization in 2019
compared to 2018  and lower storm-recovery cost amortization primarily as a result of the final payment of the storm-recovery bonds
in the third quarter 2019 (see Note 9 - FPL). Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued
asset removal costs provided under the 2016 rate agreement in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization
is recorded as a reduction to (or when reversed as an increase to) accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent
regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2019 , approximately $893 million remains in accrued
asset removal costs related to reserve amortization. The decreases in depreciation and amortization expense during 2019 were
partly of fset by increased depreciation related to higher plant in service balances.
NEER: Results of Operations
NEER owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets primarily in the
U.S., as well as in Canada. NEER also provides full energy and capacity requirements services, engages in power and gas
marketing and trading activities, owns and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines and invests in
natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production and pipeline infrastructure assets. NEER’ s net income less net loss attributable to
noncontrolling interests for 2019  and 2018  was $1,807 millio n and $4,704 millio n, respectivel y, resulting in a decrease  in 2019  of
$2,897 million . The primary drivers, on an after-tax basis, of the change are in the following table.

New Investments
In 2019 , results from new investments increased primar ily due to higher earnings, including the net effect of deferred income taxes
and other benefits associated with PTCs and ITCs, related to the addition of wind and solar generating projects during or after 2018.
Other Factors
Supplemental to the primary drivers of the changes in NEER's net income less net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests
discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's  consolidated statements of income
as they relate to NEER.
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues for 2019  increased $655 million  primarily due to:
•favorable unrealized mark-to-market activity of $295 million from non-qualifying hedges,
•revenues from new investments of $232 million,
•higher revenues of $198 million from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading business, and
•higher revenues of $122 million from the gas infrastructure business,
39
Table of Contents
partly of fset by ,
•lower reven ues from existing assets of $226 million primarily related to the absence of revenues of certain wind and solar
facilities sold to NEP  in December 2018 and June 2019 and lower wind resource as compared to 2018.
Operating Expenses - net
Operating expenses - net for 2019  increased $19 million  primarily due to:
•higher fuel and depreciation expense of $150 million primarily related to the customer supply and proprietary power and gas
trading and gas infrastructure businesses,
•higher operating expenses associated with new investments of approximately $137 million, and
•an impairment charge of approximately $72 million in 2019 related to the decision to no longer move forward with the
construction of a wind facility (see Note 1 - Construction Activity),
partly of fset by ,
•higher net gains on the disposal of businesses/assets of $320 million, primarily related to the gain recognized on the sale of
ownership interests in wind and solar projects to NEP  (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets).
 
Interest Expense
NEER's interest expense for 2019  increased $278 million  primarily reflecting unfavorable impacts of approximately $251 million
related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments and higher borrowing costs to support growth in the
business.
Equity in Earnings of Equity Method Investees
Lower earnings from equity method investees in 2019  prima rily reflects equity in losses of NEP primarily related to unfavorable
impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments and the absence of approximately $150 million
related to a 2018 favora ble adjustment at NEP to the differential membership interests due to the decrease in the federal corporate
income tax rate. The decrease was partly of fset by increased equity in earnings of other equity method investees.
Gain on NEP  Deconsolidation
The NEP  deconsolidation resulted in a gain of approximately $3.9 billion ($3.0 billion after tax) in NEE's consolidated statements of
income during 2018. See Note 1 -  NextEra Energy Partners, LP .
Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities Held in NEER's Nuclear Decommissioning Funds - net
Changes in the fair value of equity securities in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds, primarily equity securities in NEER's
special use funds, relate to favorable market conditions in 2019 compared to 2018.
Tax Credits, Benefits and Expenses
PTCs from wind projects and ITCs from solar and certain wind projects are reflected in NEER’ s earnings. PTCs are recognized as
wind energy is generat ed and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, and were
approximately $75 million and $88 million in 2019  and 2018 , respectivel y. ITCs totaled approximately $199 million and $131 million
in 2019  and 2018 , respectivel y. A portion of the PTCs and ITCs have been allocated to investors in connection with sales of
differential membership interests. PTCs and ITCs can significantly affect the effective income tax rate depending on the amount of
pretax income. The amount of PTCs recognized can be significantly af fected by wind generation and by PTC roll of f. See Note 6.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents the activity related to the sales of differential membership
interests. The decrease for 2019 primarily reflects the absence of a 2018 adjustment of approximately $497 million ($373 million
after-tax) related to the decrease in federal corporate income tax rate ef fective January 1, 2018.
Gulf Power: Results of Operations
Following its acquisition in January 2019, Gulf Power contributed approximately $180 million  of net income attributable to NEE for
2019. Gulf Power's operating revenues were approximately $1,487 million  and operating expenses totaled $1,216 million  for 2019.
Corporate and Other: Results of Operations
Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income
and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expe nse to NEER. Interest expense is
allocated based on a deemed capital structu re of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy
Resources' subsidiaries.
Corporate and Other's results decreased $315 million during  2019  primarily reflecting  higher interest costs associated with higher
debt balance s primarily related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing, higher  after-tax losses of appro ximately $114 million related
to non-qualifying hedge activity , as well as higher acquisition and integration costs incurred in 2019.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
NEE and its subsidiaries  require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working
capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, payment of maturing debt obligations and,
from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be
satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term
debt and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and sales of assets to NEP or third
parties, consistent with NEE’s and FPL’s objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capita l structure that will support a strong
investment grade credit rating.  NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity
for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to
maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the
execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.
In October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited
partner interests in NEP. Under the program, purchases may be made in amounts, at prices  and at such times as NEE or its
subsidiaries deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on
such terms and conditio ns as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and
business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchas e program does not require NEE to
acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated by NEE at any time. The purpose of the program is
not to cause NEP’ s common units to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be
deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2019 , NEE had purchased approximately $36 million of NEP common units under
this program . At December 31, 2019 , NEE owned a nonco ntrolling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned
approximately 59.9% of NEP’ s voting power .

(a)Provide for the funding of loans up to the amount of the credit facility and the issuance of letters of credit up to $2,525 million ($575 million for FPL, $75 million for
Gulf Power and $1,875 million for NEECH). The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional liquidity in
the event of a loss to the companies’ or their subsidiaries’ operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPL’s
syndicated revolving credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $948 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development
revenue bonds (tax exempt bonds) in the event they are tendered by individual bondholders and not remarketed prior to maturity, as well as, the repayment of
approximately $236 million of floating rate notes in the event an individual noteholder requires repayment prior to maturity. Gulf Power's syndicated revolving credit
facilities are also available to support the purchase of approximately $269 million of its tax exempt bonds in the event they are tendered by individual bondholders
and not remarketed prior to maturity. Approximately $2,314 million of FPL's and $4,109 million of NEECH's syndicated revolving credit facilities expire in 2024.
(b)Only available for the issuance of letters of credit.
At December 31, 2019 , 73 banks particip ate in FPL’s, Gulf Power's and NEECH’ s revolving credit facilities, with no one bank
providing more than 6% of the combined revolving credit facilities. European banks provide approximately 25% of the comb ined
revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement, NEE guarantees the payment of NEECH’ s debt obligations
under its revolving credit facilities.  In order for FPL, Gulf Power or NEECH to borrow or to have letters of credit issued under the
terms of their respective revolving credit facilities and, also for NEECH, its letter of credit facilities, FPL, in the case of FPL, Gulf
Power in the case of Gulf Power , and NEE, in the case of NEECH, are required, among other things, to maintain a ratio of funded
debt to total capitalizatio n that does not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL, Gulf Power and NEECH revolving credit facilities also
contain default and related acceleration provisio ns relating to, among other things, failure of FPL, Gulf Power and NEE, as the case
may be, to maintain the respective ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. At December 31, 2019 ,
each of NEE, Gulf Power and FPL  was in compliance with its required ratio.
Capital Support
Guarantees, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Indemnifications (Guarantee Arrangements)
Certain subsidiaries of NEE issue guarantees and obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as provide indemnities, to
facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. Substantially all of the guarantee arrangements are on behalf of
NEE’ s consolidated subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail below . NEE is not required to recognize liabilities associated with
guarantee arrangements issued on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that they will be required to
perform. At December 31, 2019 , NEE believes that there is no material exposure related to these guarantee arrangements.
NEE subsidiaries issue guarantees related to equity contribution agreements associated with the development, construction and
financing of certain power generation facilities,  engineering, procurement and construction agreements and equity contributions
associated with natural gas pipeline projects under development and construction and a related natural gas transportation
agreement. Commitments associated with these activities are included in the contracts table in Note 15.
In addition, at December 31, 2019 , NEE subsidiaries had approximately $3.6 billion in guarantees related to obligations under
purchased power agreements, nuclear-related activities, payment obligations related to PTCs, as well as other types of contractual
obligations.
43
Table of Contents
In some instances, subsidiaries of NEE elect to issue guarantees instead of posting other forms  of collateral required under certain
financing arrangements, as well as for other project-level cash management activities. At December 31, 2019 , these guarantees
totaled approximately $375 million and support, among other things, cash management activities, including those related to debt
service and O&M service agreements, as well as other specific project financing requirements.
Subsidiaries of NEE also issue guarantees to support customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities, including the
buying and selling of wholesale and retail energ y commodities. At December 31, 2019 , the estimated mark-to-market exposure (the
total amount that these subsidiaries of NEE could be required to fund based on energy commodity market prices at December 31,
2019 ) plus contract settlement net payables, net of collateral posted for obligations under these guarantees totaled approximately
$733 million.
At December 31, 2019 , subsidiaries of NEE also had approximately $1.5 billion of standby letters of credit and approximately $562
million of surety bonds to support certain of the commercial activities discussed above. FPL's  and NEECH's credit facilities are
available to support the amount of the standby letters of credit.
In addition, as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of NEE have agreed and in the
future may agree to make payments to compens ate or indemnify other parties, including those associated with asset divestitures, for
possible unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may include, but are not limited
to, an adver se judgment in a lawsuit or the impo sition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law,
or the triggering of cash grant recapture provis ions under the Recovery Act. NEE is unable to estimate the maximum potential
amount of future paymen ts under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them to make payments have not yet
occurred or , if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence.
Certain guarantee arrangements described above contain requirements for NEECH and FPL to maintain a specified credit rating.
For a discus sion of credit rating downgrade triggers, see Credit Ratings below . NEE has guaranteed certain payment obligations of
NEECH, including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment
guarantees and indemnifications, and NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER
segment.
Shelf Registration
In July 2018, NEE, NEECH and FPL filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities, which
became effective upon filing. The amount of secu rities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective
boards of directors. Securities that may be issued under the registration statement include, depending on the registrant, senior debt
securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, common stock, preferred stock, stock
purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities.

2019, all of FPL's and Gulf Power's tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase had been successfully remarketed. Also includes at FPL floating rate notes of
approximately $236 million maturing after 2024 that permit individual noteholders to require repayment prior to maturity. FPL’s syndicated revolving credit facilities
are available to support the purchase of tax exempt bonds and the repayment of floating rate notes. Gulf Power's syndicated revolving credit facilities are available to
support the purchase of Gulf Power's tax exempt bonds.

Credit Ratings
NEE’ s liquid ity, ability to access credit and capital markets, cost of borrowings and collateral posting requirements under certain
agreements is dependent on its and its subsidiaries credit ratings. At February 14, 2020 , Moody’ s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’ s),
S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to NEE, FPL  and NEECH:
 Moody's (a) S&P (a)  Fitch (a)
NEE: (b)    
Corporate credit rating Baa1 A-  A-
FPL: (b)    
Corporate credit rating A1 A  A
First mortgage bonds Aa2 A+  AA-
Senior unsecured notes A1 A  A+
Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds (c) VMIG-1/P-1 A-1  F1

NEECH: (b)    
Corporate credit rating Baa1 A-  A-
Debentures Baa1 BBB+  A-
Junior subordinated debentures Baa2 BBB  BBB
Commercial paper P-2 A-2  F2
_________________________
(a)A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or
withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.
(b)The outlook indicated by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch is stable.
(c)Short-term ratings are presented as all bonds outstanding are currently paying a short-term interest rate. At FPL's election, a portion or all of the bonds may be
adjusted to a long-term interest rate.
NEE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt. A
change in ratings is not an event of default under  applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit
facilities noted above, the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities.
Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities’  agreements are tied to credit ratings. A ratings downgrade
also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short-te rm debt issuances and borrowings
and addition al or replacement credit facilities. In addition, a ratings downgrade could result in, among other things, the requirement
that NEE subsidiaries post collateral under certain agreements and guarantee arrangements, including, but not limited to, those
related to fuel procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding,  debt-related reserves and trading
activities. FPL ’s, Gulf Power's and NEECH’ s credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements.
Covenants
NEE's chart er does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter , the ability of NEE to pay
dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. For example, FPL
pays dividends to NEE in a manner consistent  with FPL's long-term targeted capital structure. However , the mortgage securing
FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to NEE and the
issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. Additionally , in some circumstances, the mortgage restricts the amount of retained
earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out
in the mortg age. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPL's use of
retained earnings. At December 31, 2019 , no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage and, in light of
FPL's curren t financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends
would be af fected by these limitations.
FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted  net earnings test set forth in the
mortgage, which generally  requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of
the aggregate principal amount of, FPL’s first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non-junior FPL
indebtedness. At December 31, 2019 , cove rage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019  would  have been approximately 8.2
times the annual interest requirements and approximately 3.7 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds
are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property
retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage  bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage
trustee. At December 31, 2019 , FPL could have issued  in excess of $22 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the
unfunded property additions and retired first mortgage bonds. At December 31, 2019 , no cash was deposited with the mortgage
trustee for these purposes.
In September 2006, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, September 2006 RCC) in
connection with NEECH 's offering of $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066
(Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of perso ns that buy, hold or sell a specified
series
46
Table of Contents
of long-term  indebtedness (covered debt) of NEECH (other than the Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of
NEE. NEECH's 3.625% Debentures, Series due June 15, 2023 have been designated as the covered debt under the September
2006 RCC. The Septem ber 2006 RCC provides that NEECH may redeem, and NEE or NEECH  may purchase, any Series B junior
subordinated debentures  on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a
specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitation s described in the September 2006
RCC. Qualif ying securit ies are securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the
Series B junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 365 days prior to the date of
the redemption or repurchase of the Series B junior subordinated debentures.
In June 2007, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, June 2007 RCC) in connection with
NEECH's offering of $400 million principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series C junior
subordinated debentures ). The June 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt
of NEECH (other than the Series C junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. NEECH's 3.625% Debentures,
Series due June 15, 2023 have been designated as the covered debt under the June 2007 RCC . The June 2007 RCC provides that
NEECH may redeem or purchase, or satisfy , discharge or defease (collectively , defease), and NEE and any majority-owned
subsidiary of NEE or NEECH may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before June 15, 2037, only to the
extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised
from the issuance, during the 365 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that
have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series C junior
subordinated debenture s at the time of redemp tion, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the June
2007 RCC.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
NEE’ s signif icant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared under
GAAP . Critical accounting policies are those that NEE believes are both most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and
results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may
result in materially dif ferent amounts being reported under dif ferent conditions or using dif ferent assumptions.
NEE considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its
consolidated financial statements:
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities
NEE uses derivative instruments (primarily swap s, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent
in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity , as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily
with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize
the value of its power generation and gas infras tructure assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to
take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.
Nature of Accounting Estimates
Accounting pronouncem ents require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, which may require significant
judgment to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. This applies not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to
any contrac t having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying
derivatives accounting guidance to contracts. In the event changes in interpretation occur , it is possible that contracts that currently
are excluded from deriva tives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair
value recorded in the statement of income.
Assumptions and Accounting Approach
Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value using a combination
of market and income approaches. Fair values for some of the longer-term contracts where liquid markets are not available are
derived through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as internally developed models which estimate the fair value
of a contract by calculat ing the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. Forward prices
represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commo dity at a future date.  The near-ter m
forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable
market quotes. However , in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors
including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity , the expected system heat rate (which measures
the efficiency of power  plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a
fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. NEE estimates the fair value of
interest rate and foreign currency derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique
utilizing  the net

Table of Contents
amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the derivative agreements. The assumptions in these models are
critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.
At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value  of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until
the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the  fuel clause . See Note 4.
In NEE’ s non-rate regul ated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives’  fair
value for power purchas es and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel
purchases used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity
method investees’  related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE’ s consolidated statements of
income.
For interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in
interest expense and the equity method investe es' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in
NEE's conso lidated state ments of income. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a
discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.
Certain deriv ative transa ctions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transaction s do not meet the requirements for
hedge accou nting, hedg e accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value
of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility .
These chan ges in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computin g adjusted earnings and could be
significant to NEER’ s results because the economic offset to the positions are not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net
income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying
hedge category for certa in energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in
the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE’ s management views results expressed
excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a mean ingful measure of current period
performance. For additional information regardin g derivative instruments, see Note 4, Overview and Energy Marketing and Trading
and Market Risk Sensitivity .
Accounting for Pension Benefits
NEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory define d benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries.
Management believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required
to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust
dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its
subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.
Nature of Accounting Estimates
For the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits
attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a
number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of
employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on
assumptions concerning  future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial
calculations based on the plan’ s provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in
compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
Assumptions and Accounting Approach
Accounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded
status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders’  equity in the year in which the changes occur . Since NEE is
the plan sponsor , and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this
accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains
and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods
and that otherwise would  be recorded in AOCI are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory
treatment.
48
Table of Contents
Net periodic pension income is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions for the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017  include:
 2019 2018  2017
Discount rate 4.26% 3.59%  4.09%
Salary increase 4.40% 4.10%  4.10%
Expected long-term rate of return, net of investment management fees 7.35% 7.35%  7.35%
In developing these assumptions, NEE evaluated input, including other qualitative and quantitative factors, from its actuaries and
consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. In addition, for the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan
assets, NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond
asset mix similar to its pension fund, as well as its pension fund's  historical compounded returns. NEE believes that 7.35%  is a
reasonable long-term rate of return, net of investment management fees, on its pension plan assets. NEE will continue to evaluate
all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually , and will adjust them as appropriate.
NEE utilizes in its determination of pension income a market-related valuation of plan assets. This market-related valuation reduces
year-to-year volatility and recognizes investmen t gains or losses over a five-year period following the year in which they occur .
Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value
of plan assets and the actual return realized on those plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or
losses over a five-year period, the future value of plan assets will be affected as previously defer red gains or losses are recognized.
Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are
deferred and recognized in determining pensio n income only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit
obligations or the market-related value of plan assets.
The followin g table illustrates the effect on net periodic pension income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed
above, while holding all other assumptions constant:
  Decrease in 2019

Expected long-term rate of return (0.5)%  $ (22) $ (14)
Discount rate 0.5%  $ (2) $ (1)
Salary increase 0.5%  $ (2) $ (1)
NEE also utilizes actuari al assumptions about mortality to help estimate obligations of the pension plan. NEE has adopted the latest
revised mortality tables and mortality improvement scales released by the Society of Actuaries, which did not have a material impact
on the pension plan's obligation.
See Note 3.
Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets
NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indica te that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable.
Nature of Accounting Estimates
The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve
estimates and judgment s about future events. In particular , the aggregate amount of cash flows  determines whether an impairment
exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and
circumstances associated with each long-lived asset, the ef fects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized.
Assumptions and Accounting Approach
An impairme nt loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows
associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset
exceeds the asset’ s fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an
appropriate interest rate. See Note 5 - Nonrecurring Fair V alue Measurements.

Table of Contents
Decommissioning and Dismantlement
NEE accoun ts for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively , AROs) under accounting
guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be
reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associ ated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-
lived assets.  NEE's AROs  relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for
the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities.
Nature of Accounting Estimates
The calculation of the future cost of retiring long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement costs,
involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concer ning whether or not such costs are
considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making
projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, NEE
also makes interest rate and rate of return projections on its investments in determining recommended funding requirements for
nuclear deco mmissioning costs. Periodically , NEE is required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual
expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For
example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates for nuclear decommissioning costs would increase NEE’ s AROs at
December 31, 2019  by approximately $254 million .
Assumptions and Accounting Approach
FPL - For ratemak ing purpos es, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of
each unit based on studies that are approved by the FPSC. The most recent studies, filed in 2015, reflect, among other things, the
expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL’s nuclear units at the time of the studies. After giving effect to the recent license
extensions for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4, FPL’s portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including
spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settle ment agreement, is estimated to be
approximately $9.7 billion, or $3.3 billion expre ssed in 2019  dollar s. FPL intends to reflect the operating license extensions for
Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 in its next nuclear decommissioning studies.
FPL accrues  the cost of dismantling its fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with
the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies became effective
January 1, 2017. At December 31, 2019 , FPL’s portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately
$1.2 billion , or $510 million  expressed in 2019  dollars. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not reported as AROs. FPL
accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. Any
differences between the amount of the ARO and the amount recorde d for ratemaking purpos es are reported as a regulatory liability
in accordance with regulatory accounting.

NEER  - NEER recor ds liabilities for the present value of its expected nuclear plant decommissioning costs which are determined
using variou s internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant
and timing of decommissioning. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning
activities are expected to be complete. At December 31, 2019  and 2018, the AROs for decommissioning of NEER’s nuclear plants
approximated  $623 million  and $588 million , respectivel y. NEER’ s portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants,
including costs associated with spent fuel storag e above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement
agreement, is estimated to be approximately  $9.5 billion , or $2.0 billion  expressed in  2019  dollars.

Regulatory Accounting
Certain of NEE's businesses are subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note
1 - Rate Regulation for a detail of NEE’ s regulatory assets and liabilities.
Nature of Accounting Estimates
Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during
the recovery period.
Assumptions and Accounting Approach
Accounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated
entities. If NEE's rate-regulated entities, primaril y FPL, were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory
assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the
regulators, including the FPSC for FPL, have the authority to disallow recovery of costs that they consider excessive or imprudently
incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing  power lost when fossil and nuclear
units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The
continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.
ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
NEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices.  Financial
instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other
than trading . Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypotheti cal reasonably possible changes in
commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to
monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.
Commodity Price Risk
NEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks
inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity . In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its
power gener ation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantag e of
expected future favorable price movements. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Derivatives and
Hedging Activities and Note 4.

Interest Rate Risk
NEE's and FPL's financ ial results are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective
outstanding and expected future issua nces of debt, investments in spec ial use funds and other investments. NEE and FPL manage
their respec tive interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate contracts and using a
combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest rate contracts are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when
deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements.

______________________
(a)See Note 5.
The special use funds of NEE and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the
decommissioning of NEE's and FPL's nuclear power plants. See Note 1 - Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery . A
portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated  fair value. At FPL, changes in fair
value, includ ing any OTTI losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on
current regulatory treatment. The changes in fair value of NEE's non-rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment
to OCI, except for impair ments deemed to be other than temporary , including any credit losses, which are reported in current period
earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally
more liquid and, therefo re, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are
generally invested in longer-term securities.
At December 31, 2019 , NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $8.9 billion relate d to expected
future and outstanding debt issuances and borrowings, of which $9.6 billion manages exposure to the variability of cash flows
associated with expected future and outstandin g debt issuances at NEECH and NEER. The offsetting $700 million of notional
amount of interest rate contracts ef fectively convert fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt instruments at NEECH. See Note 4.
Based upon a hypothetic al 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near-term market change, the fair value of NEE’ s
net liabilities would increase by approximately $1,797 million ($611 million for FPL) at December 31, 2019 .
Equity Price Risk
NEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securit ies. For example, NEE’ s nuclear
decommissioning reserv e funds include marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $3,963 million
and $3,046 million  ($2,491 million  and $1,850 million  for FPL) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively . NEE's and FPL’s
investment strategy for equity securities in their nuclear decommissioning reserve funds emphasi zes marketable securities which are
broadly diversified. At December 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted on stock exchanges, which is a
reasonable near-term market change, would result in a $370 million ($236 million for FPL) reduction in fair value. For FPL, a
corresponding adjustme nt would be made to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment,
and for NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, a corresponding amount would be recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on
equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income.
Credit Risk
NEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are also exposed to credit risk through their energy mark eting and trading operations. Credit
risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NEE
manages counterparty credit risk for its subsid iaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies,
including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and
other collateral and guarantees.
Credit risk is also mana ged through the use of master netting agreements. NEE’ s credit depar tment monitors current and forward
credit exposure to count erparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual
transactions, NEE’ s energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL's energy marketing and trading division, are
exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when
assessing NEE’ s energy marketing and trading operations’  credit risk exposure include the following:
•Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry .
54
Table of Contents
•Trade recei vables and other financial instrum ents are predominately with energy , utility and financial services related
companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.
•Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EMC.
•Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not
meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the
posting of margin cash collateral.
•Master nettin g agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the
same counterparty . NEE’ s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.
Based on NEE’ s policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their
financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. At December 31, 2019 , approximately 87% of NEE’ s and 99% of
FPL's energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade
credit ratings.

NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NEE) and Florida Power & Light Company's (FPL) management are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The
consolidated financial statements, which in part are based on informed judgments and estimates made by management, have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.
To aid in carrying out this responsibility, we, along with all other members of management, maintain a system of internal accounting control
which is established after weighing the cost of such controls against the benefits derived. In the opinion of management, the overall system
of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that the assets of NEE and FPL and their subsidiaries are safeguarded and
that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are properly recorded for the preparation of financial
statements. In addition, management believes the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that material
errors or irregularities would be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their duties. Any system of
internal accounting control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can be circumvented
or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal
control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.
The system of internal accounting control is supported by written policies and guidelines, the selection and training of qualified employees,
an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of responsibility and a program of internal auditing. NEE's written policies
include a Code of Business Conduct & Ethics that states management's policy on conflicts of interest and ethical conduct. Compliance with
the Code of Business Conduct & Ethics is confirmed annually by key personnel.
The Board of Directors pursues its oversight responsibility for financial reporting and accounting through its Audit Committee. This
Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the
independent auditors to make inquiries as to the manner in which the responsibilities of each are being discharged. The independent
auditors and the internal audit staff have free access to the Committee without management's presence to discuss auditing, internal
accounting control and financial reporting matters.
Management assessed the effectiveness of NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, using the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013). Based on this assessment, management believes that NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2019.
NEE's and FPL's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, is engaged to express an opinion on NEE's and
FPL's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting. Their reports are based
on procedures believed by them to provide a reasonable basis to support such opinions. These reports appear on the following pages.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of
NextEra Energy , Inc. and Florida Power & Light Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NextEra Energy , Inc. and subsi diaries (NEE) and Florida Power &
Light Company and subsidiaries (FPL) as of December 31, 2019 , base d on criteria established in Internal Control — Integ rated
Framework  (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, NEE
and FPL maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019  of NEE and FPL and our report
dated February 14, 2020 , expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
NEE's and FPL’s management are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their
assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on NEE’ s and FPL’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to NEE and FPL in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasona ble assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonabl e assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may beco me inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2018 , and NEE's  and FPL's related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows, NEE's consolidated statements of
comprehensive income and of equity , and FPL’s consolidated statements of common shareholder ’s equity , for each of the three
years in the period ende d December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of NEE and the
consolidated financial position of FPL as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conform ity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 14, 2020 , expressed unqualified opinions on NEE’ s and FPL ’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These finan cial stateme nts are the responsibili ty of NEE’ s and FPL’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
NEE’ s and FPL’s financ ial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independe nt with respect to NEE and FPL in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud. Our audit s included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estim ates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Critical Audit Matter - NEE
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements of NEE that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates  to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financi al statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjec tive, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicati ng the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.
NEE - Operating Revenue - Unrealized Gains - Refer to Note 5 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
NEE enters into comple x energy derivatives and transacts in certain markets that are thinly traded, which may result in subjective
estimates of fair value that include unobservable inputs. Changes in the derivatives’  fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel
sales and trading activiti es are primarily recogni zed on a net basis in operating revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2019,
unrealized gains associated with Level 3 transactions of $638 million are included in opera ting revenues in the consolidated
statement of income of NEE.
Given mana gement uses  complex proprietary models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of Level 3 derivative assets
and liabilities , performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs required a high degree of
auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our firm specialists who possess significant
quantitative and modeling expertise.

How the Critical Audit Matter W as Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to operating revenue - unrealized gains included the following, among others:
•We tested the ef fectiveness of controls, including those relating to commodity valuation models, and market data validation.
•We selected a sample of transactions, obtained an understanding of the business rationale of transactions and read the
underlying contractual agreements.
•We used personnel in our firm who specialize in energy transacting to assist in auditing NEE’s energy transactions,
including testing certain inputs in managements fair value models.
•We used personnel in our firm who specialize in the valuation of energy products to independently value Level 3
transactions to provide us with a benchmark for comparison to NEE valuations.

NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017
1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies
Basis of Presentation  - The operations of NextEra Energy , Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power & Light
Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary , and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy
Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively , NEER ), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting
purposes. FPL's principal business is a rate-regu lated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than five million  customer
accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida. NEER invests in indepe ndent power projects through both
controlled and consolidated entities and noncontrolling ownership interests in joint ventures. NEER participates in natural gas,
natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure
through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests. NEER also invests in rate-regulated
transmission facilities and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and
consolidated entities. See Note 16 for a discussion of the movement of NEET  to the NEER segment from Corporate and Other .
The consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also
include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing
NEE's interest in entities  it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity
method investees; the net income of these entities is included in equity in earnings of equity method investees. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts included in prior years' consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the
use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue s and expenses and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could dif fer from those estimates.
NextEra Energy Partners, LP - NEP was formed in 2014 to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable
long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP  OpCo). NEP owns or has an
interest in a portfolio of wind and solar projects and long-term contracted natural gas pipelines. NEP was deconsolidated from NEE
for financial reporting purposes in January 2018 as a result of changes made to NEP's governance structure during 2017 that,
among other things, enhanced NEP common unitholder governance rights. The new governance structure established a NEP board
of directors whereby NEP unitholders have the ability to nominate and elect board members , subject to certain limitations and
requirements, which elected board members commenced service in January 2018. Subsequent to deconsolidation, NEE owns a
noncontrolling interest in NEP and began reflecting its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment with its
earnings/losses from NEP as equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees and accoun ting for NextEra Energy Resources'
asset sales to NEP as third-party sales in its consolidated financial statements. NEER continues to operate the projects owned by
NEP and provide servi ces to NEP under various related party operations and maintenance , administrative and management
services agreements.
In connection with the deconsolidation, NEE recorded an initial investment in NEP of approxim ately $4.4 billion based  on the fair
value of NEP OpCo and NEP common units that were held by subsidiaries of NEE on the decon solidation date, which investment is
included in the investme nt in equity method investees on NEE's consolidated balance sheets . See Note 10. The fair value was
based on the market price of NEP common units as of January 1, 2018, which resulted in NEE recording a gain of approximately
$3.9 billion  ($3.0 billion  after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Prior to the deconsolida tion, NEE owned a controlling general partner interest in NEP and consolidated NEP for financial reporting
purposes. NEE presente d its limited partner interests in NEP as a noncontrolling interest in NEE's consolidated financial statements.
NEE’ s partnership interest in NEP OpCo's operating projects based on the number of outstanding NEP OpCo common units was
approximately 65.1% at December 31, 2017. Certain equity and asset transactions between NEP, NEER and NEP OpCo involve the
exchange of cash, energy projects and ownership interests in NEP  OpCo.
Operating Revenues - FPL and NEER genera te substantially all of NEE’ s operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from
contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating
revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross
receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees
and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however , the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the
amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers
located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly , franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in
operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income and were
approximately $763 million , $738 million  and $767 million  in 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respe ctively . FPL also collects municipal utility
taxes which  are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.
Certain NEER commodi ty contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair
value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue. See Energy Trading below and Note 4.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Rate Regulation  - FPL, the most signific ant of NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries, is subject to rate regulation by the FPSC and the
Federal Energy Regulat ory Commission (FERC). Its rates are designed to recover the cost of providing service to its customers
including a reasonable rate of return on inves ted capital. As a result of this cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting
guidance that allows regulators to create asset s and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities.
Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the
ratemaking process.
NEE's and FPL's regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows:

Cost recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to
be recovere d through various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, certain costs
associated with the acquisition of several electric generation facilities, certain construction-related costs for certain of FPL's solar
generation facilities, and conservation and certain environmental-related costs.  Revenues from cost recovery clauses are recor ded
when billed; FPL achie ves matching of costs and related revenues by deferring the net underrecovery or overrecovery . Any
underrecovered costs or overrecovered revenues are collected from or returned to customers in subsequent periods.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , FPL had regulatory assets, net of amortization, of approximately $799 million and $963 million ,
respectively , (included in current and noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets) related to
acquisitions during 2015, 2017 and 2018 associated with three  coal-fired electric gener ation facilities located in Florida with which
FPL had long-term purchased power agreements. The majority of these regulatory assets are being amortized over approximately
nine years . Two of the three  facilities have been retired and FPL has reduced the third facility’ s operations with the intention of
phasing the facility out of service.
In 2018, FPL early retire d three  of its generation facilitie s. As a result of the retirements, FPL reclassified the net book value of these
units (approximately $875 million) from plant in service and other property to current and noncurrent regulatory assets.  Recovery  of
$729 millio n of these regulatory assets has been deferred until FPL’s base rates are next reset in a general base rate
proceeding. The remainder of these regulatory assets are being amortized over 15 years. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the
regulatory assets, net of amortization, totaled approximately $851 million and $870 million, respectively , and are included in current
and noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Additionally , other regulatory assets and
liabilities are discussed within various subsections in Note 1 below . 
If FPL were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless
regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each
reporting period.
FPL Base Rates Effective January 2017 through at least December 2020 - In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order
approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2016 rate agreement).
Key elements of the 2016 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2017 through at least December 2020, include, among
other things, the following:
•New retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:
◦$400 million  beginning January 1, 2017;
◦$211 million  beginning January 1, 2018; and
◦$200 million  beginning April 1, 2019 for a new approximately 1,720  megawatts (MW) natura l gas-fired combined-
cycle unit in Okeechobee County , Florida that achieved commercial operation on March 31, 2019.
•In addition, FPL is eligible to receive base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 300 MW annual ly of new solar
generation in each of 2017 through 2020 with an installed cost cap of $1,750  per kilowatt (kW). Approximately 900 MW of new
solar generating capacity has become operational, 600 MW in the first quarter of 2018 and 300 MW in the first quarter of 2019.
An additional 300 MW is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2020.
•FPL's allowed regulatory return on common equity (ROE) is 10.55 %, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60 %. If FPL's earned
regulatory ROE falls below 9.60%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.60 %, any
party other than FPL  may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.
•Subject to certain condi tions, FPL may amortize , over the term of the 2016 rate agreement, up to $1.0 billion of depreciation
reserve surplus plus the reserve amount that remained under FPL's previous rate agreemen t (approximately $250 million),
provided that in any year of the 2016 rate agree ment FPL must amortize at least enough reserve to maintain a 9.60% earned
regulatory ROE but may not amortize any reserve that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11.60 %.
•Future storm  restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery
petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000  kilowatt-hour (kWh) of
usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recove ry. Any additional costs  would be eligible for recovery in
subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million  in any given  calendar year, FPL may request an increase to
the $4 surcharge to recover amounts above $400 million . See Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery below .
Electric Plant, Depreciat ion and Amortization  - The cost of additions to units of property of FPL and NEER is added to electric plant
in service and other property . In accordance with regulatory accounting, the cost of FPL's units of utility property retired, less
estimated net salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs of property as well as replacements
and renewals of items determined to be less than units of utility property are charged to other operations and maintenance (O&M)
expenses. At December 31, 2019 , the electric generation , transmission, distribution and general facilities of FPL represented
approximately 46%, 12%, 35% and 7%, respectively , of FPL's gross investment in elect ric utility plant in service and other property .
Substantially all of FPL's properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by FPL. A
number of NEER's generation, regulated transm ission and pipeline facilities are encumbered by liens securing various financings.
The net book value of NEER's assets serving as collateral was approximately $10.0 billion at December 31, 2019 . The American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as amended (Recovery Act), provided for an option to elect a cash grant (convertible
investment tax credits (ITCs)) for certain renewable energy property (renewable property). Convertible ITCs are recorded as a
reduction in property , plant and equipment on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as a reduction to
depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated life of the related property . At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , convertible
ITCs, net of amortizatio n, were approximately $824 million ($128 million at FPL) and $1.2 billion ($134 million at FPL). At
December 31, 2019  and 2018 , approxima tely $10 million and $138 million, respectivel y, of such convertible ITCs are included
primarily in other receivables on NEE's consolidated balance sheets.
Depreciation of FPL's electric property is primarily provided on a straight-line average remaining life basis. FPL includes in
depreciation expense a provision for fossil and solar plant dismantlement, interim asset remov al costs, accretion related to asset
retirement obligations (see Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs
below), storm recovery amortization and amort ization of pre-construction costs associated with planned nuclear units recovered
through a cost recovery clause. For substantially all of FPL's property , depreciation studies are typically performed and filed with the
FPSC every four years. As part of the 2016 rate agreement, the FPSC  approved new depreciation rates which became effective
January 1, 2017. In accordance with the 2016 rate agreement discussed in Rate Regulation above, FPL recorded reserve
amortization (reversal) of approximately $(357) million , $(541) million  and $1,250  million  in 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively .
Reserve amortization is recorded as a reduction to (or when reversed as an increase to) accrued asset removal costs which is
reflected in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. In 2017, FPL used available reserve
amortization to offset nearly all of the Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs that were expense d, and FPL is partially restoring the
reserve amortization through tax savings gener ated during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. See Note 6. In 2019, FPL used
available reserve amorti zation resulting from operational efficiencies generated at the business to offset all of the Hurricane Dorian
storm restor ation costs that were expensed. See Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Restoration Costs below . The weighted
annual composite depreciation and amortization rate for FPL's electric utility plant in service, including capitalized software, but
excluding
71

NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
the effects of decommissioning, dismantlement and the depreciation adjustments discussed above, was approximately 3.9%, 3.8%
and 3.7% for 2019, 2018 and 2017 , respectively . FPL files a twelve-month forecast with the FPSC each year which contains a
regulatory ROE intended to be earned based on the best information FPL has at that time assuming normal weather . This forecast
establishes a fixed targeted regulatory ROE. In order to earn the targeted regulatory ROE in each reporting period under the 2016
rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculate d using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in
conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which  primarily includes the retail base
portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact
of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE.
NEER's electric plant in service less salvage value, if any, are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives. At December 31, 2019 , wind, solar and nucle ar plants represented approximately 54%, 12% and 10%,
respectively , of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property; the respective amounts at December 31, 2018  were
53%, 14% and 10%. The estimated useful lives of NEER's plants range primarily from 25 to 35 years for wind plants, 25 to 30 years
for solar plants and 23 to 47 years for nuclear plants (see Note 5 - Nonrec urring Fair Value Measurements). NEER reviews the
estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. NEER's oil and gas production assets, representing approximately
15% and 13%, respe ctively , of NEER's  depreciable electric plant in service and other property at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , are
accounted for under the successful efforts method. Depletion expenses for the acquisition of reserve rights and development costs
are recognized using the unit of production method.
Nuclear Fuel - FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of
nuclear fuel. See Note 15 - Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production
method.
Construction Activity  - Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of
capital, including an ROE, used to finance constr uction projects. FPL records the portion of AFUD C attributable to borrowed funds as
a reduction of interest expense and the remaind er as other income. FPSC rules limit the recording of AFUDC to projects that have
an estimated  cost in excess of 0.5% of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules
allow construction projects below the 0.5% threshold as a component of rate base. During 2019, 2018 and 2017 , FPL capitalized
AFUDC at a rate of 6.22%, 5.97% and 6.16%, respectivel y, which amounted to approximately  $80 million, $114 million and $101
million , respectively . See Note 15 - Commitments.
FPL's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, engineering
costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these
costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property . Capitalized costs assoc iated with construction activities are
charged to O&M expenses when recoverability is no longer probable.
NEER capita lizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of a
power plant  or sale of development rights. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , NEER's capitalized development costs totale d
approximately $651 million  and $630 million , respectively , which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated
balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new
project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other
assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&M expenses when it is no longer
probable that these costs will be realized.
NEER's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, third-party
engineering costs, capitalized interest and other costs directly associated with the construction and development of various projects.
Interest capitalized on construction projects amounted to approximately $135 million, $94 million and $89 million during 2019, 2018
and 2017 , respectivel y. Interest expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH ) to NEER is based on a
deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. Upon
commencement of project operation, costs associated with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in service
and other property . In September 2019, NEER determined it was no longer moving forward with the construction of a 220 MW wind
facility due to unresolved permitting issues. NEE recorded charges of approximately $72 millio n ($54 millio n after tax), which are
included in impairment charges in NEE’ s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 , primarily
related to the write-of f of capitalized construction costs .
Asset Retirement Obligations  - NEE and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement
obligations (collectively , AROs) under accounting  guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the
period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as
part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. NEE's AROs relate primarily to decomm issioning obligations of FPL's and
NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. See Decommissioning
of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 13.

NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to a regulatory liability using
a syste matic and rationa l method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are
recognized as an increa se in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulato ry liability . Changes resulting from
revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO and
asset retirement cost.
For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and
rational meth od over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an
increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense
in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of
cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost, or income when asset retirement cost is
depleted.
Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs  - For ratemaking purposes,
FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and disposal of its nuclear , fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of
each unit based on nuclear decommissioning and fossil and solar dismantlement studies periodically filed with the FPSC. In addition,
FPL accrues  for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. As
approved by the FPSC , FPL previously susp ended its annual decommissioning accrual. Any differences between expense
recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory liability in
accordance with regulatory accounting. See Rate Regulation, Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, and Asset Retirement
Obligations above and Note 13.
Nuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every five years and are submitted to the FPSC for approval. FPL filed
updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2015. These studies reflect, among other things, the
expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. The 2015 studies provide for the
dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing
in 2032 and 2033, respectively , and provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning
activities to be integrated with the dismantlemen t of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing
spent fuel on site pendi ng removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility . After giving effect to the license extensions for
Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4, FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including costs
associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under a spent
fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.7 billion , or $3.3 billion  expre ssed in 2019  dollar s. FPL intends to
reflect the operating license extensions for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 in its next nuclear decommissioning studies.
Restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear
decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.
Marketable securities held in the decommissioni ng funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 5. Fund earnings, consisting of
dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in
unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset
or liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund
earnings. During 2019 , 2018  and 2017  fund earnings on decom missioning funds were approximately $125 million , $94 million  and
$114 million , respectively . The tax ef fects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.
Fossil and solar plant dismantlement studies are typically performed at least every four years  and are submitted to the FPSC for
approval. As part of the 2016 rate agreement, the FPSC approved an annual expense of $26 million  based on FPL's 2016 fossil and
solar dismantlement studies, which became effective January 1, 2017, and is recorded in depre ciation and amortization expense in
NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2019 , FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil
and solar units is approximately $1.2 billion , or $510 million  expressed in 2019  dollars.
NEER's AROs include nuclear decommissioning liabilities for Seabrook Station (Seabrook), Duane Arnold Energy Center (Duane
Arnold) and Point Beac h Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar facilities. The
liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to
be complete. See Note 13. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , NEER's ARO was approximately $1,097  millio n and $988 million ,
respectively , and was primarily determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety
of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning or dismantlement. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of
decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the
DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.5 billion, or $2.0 billion expressed in 2019
dollars. The ultimate cost to dismantle NEER's wind and solar facilities is estimated to be approximately $1.8 billion .
Seabrook files a comprehensive nuclear decom missioning study with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing
Committee (NDFC) every four years ; the most recent study was filed in 2019. Seabrook's decommissioning funding plan is also
subject to annual review  by the NDFC. Currently , there are no ongoing decommissioning funding requirements for Seabrook, Duane
Arnold and Point Beach, however , the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and in the case of Seabrook, the NDFC, has
73

NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
the authority to require additional funding in the future. NEER's portion of Seabrook's, Duane Arnold's and Point Beach's restricted
funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission these plants is included in nucle ar decommissioning reserve funds,
which are included in special use funds on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning
funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 5. Market adjustments for debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to
other comprehensive income (OCI), except for unrealized losses associated with marketable debt securities considered to be other
than temporary , including any credit losses, which are recognized in other - net in NEE's consolid ated statements of income. Market
adjustments for equity securities are recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity  securities held in NEER's nuclear
decommissioning funds - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and
realized gains and losses are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized
for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.
Major Maintenance Costs  - FPL expenses costs associated with planned fossil maintenance as incurred. FPL recognizes costs
associated with planned major nuclear maintenance in accordance with regulatory treatment. FPL defers nuclear maintenance costs
for each nuclear unit’s planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred and amorti zes the costs to O&M expense over
the period from the end of the current outage to the end of the next planned outage. 
NEER uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major maintenance costs. NEER's major maintenance costs for its
nuclear generation units and combustion turbines are capitalized (included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated
balance sheets) and amortized to O&M expenses on a unit of production method over the period from the end of the last outage to
the beginning of the next planned outage.
Cash Equivalents  - Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Restricted Cash - At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , NEE had approximately $508 million ($118 million for FPL) and $4,615  million
($142 million  for FPL), respectively , of restricted cash, of which approximately $411 million  ($54 million  for FPL) and $89 million  ($81
million  for FPL), respectively , is included in current other assets and the remaining balance is included in noncurrent other assets on
NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash is primarily related to debt service  payments, bond proceeds held for
construction at FPL and margin cash collateral requirements, and, at December 31, 2018, also related to cash restricted for the
acquisition of Gulf Powe r Company (Gulf Power) (see Note 8 - Gulf Power Company). In additi on, where offsetting positions exist,
restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $139 million  is netted against deriva tive assets and $66 million  is netted against
derivative liabilities at December 31, 2019  and $184 million  is netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2018. See Note 4.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  - FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is
estimated primarily using  a percentage, derived from historical revenue and write-of f trends, of the previous four months of revenue.
Additional amounts are included in the provision to address specific items that are not considered in the calculation described above.
NEER regula rly reviews collectibility of its receivables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts
receivable based on the historical bad debt write -off trends for its retail electricity provider operati ons and, when necessary , using the
specific identification method for all other receivables.
Inventory  - FPL values materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method. NEER's materials,
supplies and fossil fuel inventories are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost and net realizable value, unless evidence
indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.
Energy Trading - NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-
following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities
to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contra cts, generation facilities and gas infrastructure assets, as well as to take advantage
of projected favorable commodity price movements. Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for at fair
value and realized gains  and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net
for all periods presented. See Note 4.
Storm Fund , Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery  - The storm  and property insurance reserve fund (storm fund) provides
coverage toward FPL's storm damage costs. Marketable securities held in the storm fund are carried at fair value. See Note 5. Fund
earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinve sted in the fund. Fund earnings, as
well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment
to the storm  and property insurance reserve (storm reserve). The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are
included in deferred income taxes. The storm fund and storm reserve are included in special use funds and noncurrent regulatory
liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.
In March 2017, FPL began recovering from its retail customers, through an interim storm surcharge over a 12-month period, eligible
storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Matthew , a 2016 hurricane, of approximately $201 million  ($294 million  of
recoverable costs less $93 million  available in FPL's storm  reserve prior to the storm), plus approximately $117 million  to replenish
the storm reserve to the level authorized in FPL's previous rate agreement. As the portion of the Hurricane Matthew surcharge
74

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
applicable to the replenis hment of the storm reserve was billed to customers (which was recorde d as operating revenues), the storm
reserve was recognized as a regulatory liability and charged to depreciation and amortiza tion expense in NEE's and FPL's
consolidated statements  of income. As part of a settlement agreement between FPL and the OPC regarding the recovery of storm
costs related to Hurrican e Matthew , FPL issued a one-time refund to customers in August 2018 totaling approximately $28 million , of
which $20 million  was for storm costs that were reclassified to property , plant and equipment.
In Septembe r 2017, FPL was impacted by Hurricane Irma, which resulted in damage through out much of FPL's service territory .
Damage to FPL property from the hurricane was primarily limited to the transmission and distribution systems. In December 2017,
following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (tax reform) as further discussed in Note 6, FPL determined that it would not
seek recovery of Hurrica ne Irma storm restoratio n costs of approximately $1.3 billion through a storm surchar ge from customers and
instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE's and FPL's consolidated stateme nts of income. As allowed under the
2016 rate agreement, FPL used available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs that
were expensed, and FPL is partially restoring the reserve amortization through tax savings generated during the term of the 2016
rate agreement.
In September 2019, FPL’s service territory was impacted by Hurricane Dorian. FPL incurred approximately $260 million  of
incremental storm restoration costs, which primarily included costs for pre-staging resources in advance of the storm to repair
damage to FPL’s distribution system. In December 2019, FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of the Hurricane Dorian
storm restoration costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in
NEE’ s and FPL’s consol idated statements of income. FPL used available reserve amortization resulting from operational efficiencies
generated at the business to of fset all of the Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs that were expensed.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  - NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairme nt loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the
asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impair ment loss to be recognized is the
amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is
determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. See Note 5 - Nonrecurring Fair Value
Measurements.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  - NEE's goodwill and other intangible assets are as follows:

NEE's, including FPL's, goodwill relates to various acquisitions which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Other intangible assets are primarily included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. NEE's other
intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives.
Amortization expense was approximately $18 million, $19 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017 , respectively , and is expected to be approximate ly $18 million, $14 million, $8 million, $7 million and $4 million for 2020 , 2021 ,
2022 , 2023  and 2024 , respectively .

Table of Contents
NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair
value-based analysis. Other intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewe d when impairment indicators are
present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted future cash flows.
Pension Plan - NEE records the service cost component of net periodic benefit income to O&M expense and the non-service cost
component to other net periodic benefit income in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE allocates net periodic pension
income to its subsidiaries based on the pens ionable earnings of the subsidiaries' employe es. Accounting guidance requires
recognition of the funded status of the pension  plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other
comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur . Since NEE is the plan sponsor , and its
subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their empl oyees, this accounting guidance is
reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior
service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise
would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in
accordance with regulatory treatment.
Stock-Based Compensa tion - NEE acco unts for stock-based payment transactions based on grant-date fair value. Compensation
costs for awards with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur . See Note 11 - Stock-Based Compensation.
Retirement of Long-T erm Debt  - For NEE's rate-regula ted subsidiaries, including FPL, gains and losses that result from differences
in reacquisition cost and the net book value of long-term debt which is retired are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability and
amortized to interest expense ratably over the remaining life of the original issue, which is consistent with their treatment in the
ratemaking process. NEE's non-rate regulated subsidiaries recognize such dif ferences in interest expense at the time of retirement.
Income Taxes  - Defe rred income taxes are recognized on all significant temporary differences between the financial statement and
tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are presented as noncurrent on NEE's and FPL's consolid ated balance sheets. In connection
with the tax sharing agreement between NEE and certain of its subsidiaries, the income tax provision at each applicable subsidiary
reflects the use of the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are
used on the consolidated tax return, are recor ded by the applicable subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining
consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at the corporate level. Included in other regulatory assets and other
regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets is the revenue equivalent of the difference in deferred income
taxes computed under accounting rules, as compared to regulatory accounting rules. The net regulatory liability totaled $4,141
million  ($3,745  million  for FPL) and $4,074  million  ($4,042  million  for FPL) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively , and is
being amortized in accor dance with the regulatory treatment over the estimated lives of the asset s or liabilities for which the deferred
tax amount was initially recognized.
Production tax credits (PTCs) are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in
applicable federal and state statutes and are recorded as a reduction of current income taxes payable, unless limited by tax law in
which instance they are recorded as deferred tax assets. NEER recognizes ITCs as a reductio n to income tax expense when the
related energy property is placed into service. FPL recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense over the depreciable life of
the related energy property . At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , FPL’s accumulated deferred ITCs were approx imately $412 million
and $326 million , respe ctively , and are included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.
NEE and FPL record a deferred income tax bene fit created by the convertible ITCs on the difference between the financial statement
and tax base s of renewable property . For NEER, this deferred income tax benefit is recorded in income tax expense in the year that
the renewab le property is placed in service. For FPL, this deferred income tax benefit is offset by a regulatory liability , which is
amortized as a reduction of depreciation expens e over the approximate lives of the related renewable property in accordance with
the regulatory treatment. At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the net deferred incom e tax benefits associate d with FPL's convertible
ITCs were approximately  $40 million  and $42 million , respectivel y, and are included in noncurrent regulatory assets and noncurrent
regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.
A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when  it is more likely than not that such
assets will not be realized. NEE recognizes interest income (expense) related to unrecognize d tax benefits (liabilities) in interest
income and interest expense, respectively , net of the amount deferred at FPL. At FPL, the offset to accrued interest receivable
(payable) on income taxes is classified as a regulatory liability (regulatory asset) which will be amortized to income (expense) over a
five-year period upon settlement in accordance with regulatory treatment. All tax positions taken by NEE in its income tax returns
that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold. NEE and its subsidiaries file income tax
returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and vario us states, the most significant of which is Florida, and certain foreign jurisdictions.
Federal tax liabilities, with the exception of certa in refund claims, are effectively settled for all years prior to 2016. State and foreign
tax liabilities, which have varied statutes of limitations regarding additional assessments, are generally effectively settled for years
prior to 2015. At December 31, 2019 , NEE had unrecognize d tax benefits of approximately $79 million that, if recognized, could
impact the annual ef fective income tax rate. The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest accruals may change
76

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
within the next 12 months; however , NEE and FPL do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on NEE’ s or FPL’s
financial statements. See Note 6.
Sales of Differential Mem bership Interests  - Certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resou rces sold Class B membership interests in
entities that have owners hip interests in wind and solar facilities, with generating capacity totalin g approximately 7,081  MW and 473
MW, respec tively , at December 31, 2019 , to third-party investors . NEE retains a controlling interest in the entities and therefore
presents the Class B member interests as noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests represents the portion of net assets in
consolidated entities that are not owned by NEE and are reported as a component of equity in NEE’ s consolidated balance sheet.
The third-pa rty investors are allocated earnings , tax attributes and cash flows in accordance  with the respective limited liability
company agreements. Those economics are allocated primarily to the third-party investors until they receive a targeted return (the
flip date) and thereafter  to NEE. NEE has the right to call the third-party interests at specified amounts if and when the flip date
occurs. NEE has determined the allocation of economics between the controlling party and third-party investor should not follow the
respective ownership percentages for each wind and solar project but rather the hypothetical liquidation of book value (HLBV)
method based on the governing provisions in each respective limited liability company agreement. Under the HLBV method, the
amounts of income and loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest reflects changes in the amount the owners would
hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the respective liquidation provisions, assuming the net assets of these
entities were liquidated at the recorded amoun ts, after taking into account any capital trans actions, such as contributions and
distributions, between the entities and the owners. At the point in time that the third-party investor , in hypothetical liquidation, would
achieve its targeted return, NEE attributes the additional hypothetical proceeds to the Class B membership interests based on the
call price. A loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on NEE’ s consolidated statements of income represents earnings attributable
to NEE. Additionally , net (income) loss attributab le to noncontrolling interests in NEE's consolidated statement of income for the year
ended December 31, 2018 includes a benefit to NEE of approximately $497 million ($373 million after tax) related to a reduction of
differential membership interests as a result of a change in the federal corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018. Pursuant
to previous accounting guidance, prior to 2018, the proceeds received on the sale of Class B membership interest in entities were
deferred and recorded as a liability recognize d in benefits associated with differential membership interests - net in NEE's
consolidated statements of income as the Class B members received their portion of the economic attributes.
Redeemable Noncontro lling Interests  - Certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Reso urces sold Class B membership interests in
entities that have owners hip interests in wind facilities to third-party investors. As specified in the respective limited liability company
agreements, if, subject to certain contingencies, certain events occur , including, among others, those that would delay construction
or cancel any of the underlying projects, an investor has the option to require NEER to return all or part of its investment. As these
potential redemptions are outside of NEER’ s control, these balances were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests on
NEE's conso lidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 . During 2019, certain contingencies were resolved resulting
in $395 million of the Dece mber 31, 2018 balance being recla ssified to noncontrolling interests. The contingen cies associated with
the December 31, 2019 balance are expected to be resolved in 2020.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)  - An entity is considered to be a VIE when its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit
the entity to finance its activities without addit ional subordinated financial support, or its equity investors, as a group, lack the
characteristics of having a controlling financial interest. A reporting company is required to consolidate a VIE as its primary
beneficiary when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to
the VIE. NEE and FPL evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events as defined by the accounting guidance
occur . See Note 9.
Leases  - NEE and FPL determi ne if an arrangement is a lease at inception. NEE and FPL recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and
a lease liability for operating and finance leases by recognizing and measuring leases at the commencement date based on the
present value of lease payments over the lease term. For sales type leases, the book value of the leased asset is removed from the
balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on fixed payments under the contract and the residual
value of the asset being leased. NEE and FPL have elected not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases and not to
separate nonlease components from associated lease components for all classes of underlying assets except for purchased power
agreements. ROU assets are included primarily in noncurrent other assets, lease liabilities are included in current and noncurrent
other liabilities and net investments in sales-type leases are included in current and noncurrent other assets on NEE’ s and FPL's
consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is included in O&M expenses, amortization expense is included in
depreciation and amortization expense and interest income associated with sales-type leases is included in operating revenues in
NEE’ s and FPL ’s consolidated statements of income. See Note 14.
 
Acquisition-Related - Durin g 2019, 2018 and 2017 , NEE and certain of its affiliates incurred costs  related to several proposed or
completed acquisitions, including transaction costs, integration costs and the payment of certain termination fees, which are included
in acquisition-related expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income. See Note 8.

Disposal of Businesses /Assets - On February  11, 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of its
ownership interest in two solar gene ration faciliti es located in Spain with a total generating capacity of 99.8 MW for net cash
proceeds of approximately €117 million  (approximately $128 million ), subject to working capital and other adjustments. In connection
with the sale, NEE anticipates recording a gain of approximately $260 million  (preta x and after tax) in its consolidated statements of
income during the three- months ended March 31, 2020. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets related to the facilities
that were classified as held for sale, which are included in current other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets, were
approximately $440 million  at December 31, 2019 and primarily represent property , plant and equipment. Liabilities associated with
assets held for sale, which are included in current other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balanc e sheets, were approximately $647
million  at December 31, 2019 and primarily represent long-term debt and interest rate derivatives.
In June 2019, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of ownership interests in three  wind generation facilities
and three  solar generation facilitie s, including noncontrolling interests in two of the solar facilities, located in the Midwest and West
regions of the U.S. with a total net ownership interest in plant capacity (net generating capacity) of 611 MW to a NEP subsidiary for
cash proceeds of approx imately $1.0 billion, plus workin g capital of $12 million . A NEER affiliate will continue to operate the facilities
included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $341 million  ($259 million  after tax) was recorded in NEE's
consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 , which is included in gains on disposal of
businesses/assets - net, and noncontrolling interests of approximately $118 million were recorded on NEE's consolidated balance
sheet.
In 2018, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of its ownership interests  in ten wind generation facilities and
one solar generation facility located in the Midwest, South and West regions of the U.S. with a total net generating capacity of 1,388
MW to a subsidiary of NEP for net cash proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion , after transaction costs and working capital
adjustments and NEP's assumption of approximately $941 million in existing noncontrol ling interests related to differential
membership investors. In connection with the sale and the related consolidating state income tax effects, a gain of approximately
$36 million  ($32 million  after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2018
and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net.
In 2017, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NEE completed the sale of its memb ership interests in its fiber-optic
telecommunications business for net cash proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion, after repayment of $370 million  of related long-
term debt. In connection  with the sale and the related consolidating state income tax effects, a gain of approximately $1.1 billion
($685 million after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended Dece mber 31, 2017 and is
included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net.
2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to custom ers at an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services . The promised goods or services in
the majority of NEE’ s contracts with customers is, at FPL, for the delivery of electricity based on tariff rates approved by the FPSC
and, at NEER, for the delivery of energy commodities and the availability of electric capacity and electric transmission.
FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE’ s operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with
customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions at NEER. For the vast majority of contracts with customers, NEE believes
that the obligation to deliver energy , capacity or transmission is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and
consumes benefits as NEE performs. In 2019  and 2018 , NEE’s revenue from contracts with customers was approximately $17.5
billion  ($12.1 billion at FPL) and approxima tely $15.4 billion ($11.8 billion at FPL), respectively . NEE's and FPL's receiva bles are
primarily associated with revenues earned from contracts with customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions at NEER, and
consist of both billed and unbilled amounts, which are recorded in customer receivables and other receivables on NEE's and FPL's
consolidated balance sheets. Receivables repre sent unconditional rights to consideration and reflect the differences in timing of
revenue recognition and cash collections. For substantially all of NEE's and FPL's receivables , regardless of the type of revenue
transaction from which the receivable originated, customer and counterparty credit risk is managed in the same manner and the
terms and conditions of payment are similar .
FPL - FPL’s revenues are derived primarily from tariff-based sales that result from providing electricity to retail customers in Florida
with no defined contractual term. Electricity sales to retail customers account for approximately  90% of FPL’s operating revenues,
the majority of which are to residential customers . FPL’s retail customers receive a bill monthly based on the amount of monthly kWh
usage with payment due monthly . For these types of sales, FPL recognizes revenue as electricity is delivered and billed to
customers, as well as an estimate for electricity delivered and not yet billed. The billed and unbilled amounts represent the value of
electricity delivered to the customer . At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , FPL's unbilled revenues amounted to approximately $389
million  and $432 million , respectively , and are included in customer receivables on NEE’ s and FPL ’s consolidated balance sheets.
NEER  - NEER’ s revenue from contracts with custome rs is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity
and electric transmission . For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy comm odities are delivered and as electric
capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in
the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent
78
Table of Contents
NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer . Revenues yet
to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging from 2020  to 2053 , will vary based on the volume of energy
or transmission delivered and/or available. NEER’ s customers typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days.
Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent
system operator annual auctions through 2023  and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates through  2034. At
December 31, 2019 , NEER expects to record approximately $945 million  of revenues related to the fixed price componen ts of such
contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.
3. Employee Retirement Benefits
Employee Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plans - NEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for
substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. NEE also has a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP), which
includes a non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management
and highly compensated employees, and sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for other benefits for retirees of NEE and its
subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The total accrued benefit cost of the SERP  and postretirement plans is
approximately $313 million ($167 million for FPL) and $226 million ($187 million for FPL) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 ,
respectively .
Pension Plan Assets, Benefit Obligations and Funded Status - The changes in assets, benefit obligations and the funded status of
the pension plan are as follows:
 2019  2018

_________________________
(a)The method of estimating the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs uses a full yield curve approach by applying a specific spot rate along the yield
curve.
NEE's investment policy for the pension plan recognizes the benefit of protecting the plan's funded status, thereby avoiding the
necessity of future employer contributions. Its broad objectives are to achieve a high rate of total return with a prudent level of risk
taking while maintaining suf ficient liquidity and diversification to avoid large losses and preserve capital over the long term.
The NEE pension plan fund's current target asset allocation, which is expected to be reached over time, is 45% equity  inves tments,
32% fixed income investmen ts, 13% alternative investments and 10% convertible securities. The pension fund's invest ment strategy
emphasizes traditional investments, broadly diversified across the global equity and fixed income markets, using a combination of
different investment styles and vehicles. The pension fund's equity and fixed income holdings consist of both directly held securities
as well as commingled investment arrangemen ts such as common and collective trusts, pooled separate accounts, registered
investment companies and limited partnerships . The pension fund's convertible security assets are principally direct holdings of
convertible securities and include a convertible security oriented limited partnership. The pension fund's alternative investments
consist primarily of private equity and real estate oriented investments in limited partnerships as well as absolute return oriented
limited partnerships that use a broad range of investment strategies on a global basis.

______________________
(a)In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for its pension plan, NEE evaluated input, including other qualitative and quantitative
factors, from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions
and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its pension fund. NEE also considered its pension fund's historical compounded returns.
Employee Contribution Plan - NEE offers an emplo yee retirement savings plan which allows eligible participants to contr ibute a
percentage of qualified compensation through payroll deductions. NEE makes matching contributions to participants' accounts.
Defined contribution expense pursuant to this plan was approximately $58 million , $54 million  and $53 million  for NEE ($36 million ,
$34 million  and $ 33 million  for FPL) for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively .
4. Derivative Instruments
NEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks
inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity , as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated
primarily with outstanding and expected future  debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power
generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL  do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.
With respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct
its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity
requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take
advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets.
These risk management activities involve the use of derivative instruments executed within prescribed limits to manage the risk
associated with fluctuating commodity prices. Transactions in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via
the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power
generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these
assets. These hedges are designed to reduc e the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity markets
associated with NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. With regard to full energy and capacity requirements
services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served.
For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these
customers and reduce the effect of unfavorable changes in the forward energy markets. Additionally , NEER takes positions in energy
markets based on differences between actual forward market levels and management's view of fundamental market conditions,
including supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy , changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and
anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes.  NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations,
subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.
Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as
either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a
regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel and
purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all
changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in
operating revenues; fuel purchases used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel, purchased power and interchange
expense; and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's
consolidated statements  of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of
income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in
the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where of fsetting positions
82
Table of Contents
NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted  and therefore physical delivery has
been deemed not to have occurred for financial reporting purposes. Settlements related to derivative instruments are primarily
recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.
For interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the
transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated  debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related
activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.  At December 31,
2019 , NEE's AOCI included amounts related to discontinued interest rate cash flow hedges with expiration dates through March
2035  and foreign currency cash flow hedges with expiration dates through September 2030 . Approximately $14 million  of net losses
included in AOCI at December 31, 2019  is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months as the principal and/or
interest payments are made. Such amounts assume no change in scheduled principal payments.
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments  - The tables below present NEE's and FPL's gross derivative positions at December 31, 2019
and December 31, 2018 , as required by disclosu re rules. However , the majority of the underlying contracts are subject to master
netting agreements and generally would not be contractually settled on a gross basis. Therefore, the tables below also present the
derivative positions on a net basis, which reflect the offsetting of positions of certain transactions  within the portfolio, the contractual
ability to settle contracts  under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral (see Note 5 - Recurring Fair
Value Meas urements for netting information), as well as the location of the net derivative position on the consolidated balance
sheets.

At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $8.9 billion and $13.4
billion , respective ly, and foreign currency contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $1.0 billion and $656 million,
respectively .
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features  - Certain derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features including,
among other things, the requirement to maintain  an investment grade credit rating from specifie d credit rating agencies and certain
financial ratios, as well as credit-related cross-default and material adverse change triggers. At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , the
aggregate fair value of NEE's derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was
approximately $1.7 billion  ($12 million  for FPL) and $1.8 billion  ($34 million  for FPL), respectively .
If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these derivative agreements were triggered, certain subsidiaries of NEE,
including FPL, could be required to post collater al or settle contracts according to contractual terms which generally allow netting of
contracts in offsetting positions. Certain derivative contracts contain multiple types of credit-related triggers. To the extent these
contracts contain a credit ratings downgrade trigger , the maximum exposure is included in the following credit ratings collateral
posting requirements. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to BBB/Baa2 (a three level downgrade for FPL and a
one level downgrade for NEECH from the current lowest applicable rating), applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post
collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $215 million  (none  at FPL) and $270 million  (none  at FPL) at
December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectivel y. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade,
applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post additional collateral such that the total posted collateral would be
approximately $1.2 billion ($35 million at FPL) and $1.5 billion ($45 million at FPL) at December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
Some derivative contracts do not contain credit  ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that require certain financial
measures be maintained  and/or have credit-rela ted cross-default triggers. In the event these provisions were triggered, applicable
NEE subsidiaries could be required to post additional collateral of up to approximately $590 million  ($75 million  at FPL) and $610
million  ($145 million  at FPL) at December 31, 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
Collateral related to derivatives may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At
December 31, 2019  and 2018 , applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately $2 million  (none  at FPL) and $2 million  (none
at FPL), respectively , in cash and $88 million (none  at FPL) and $88 million (none  at FPL), respectively , in the form of letters of credit
each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have capacity under their
credit facilitie s generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other
things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to
drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.
Additionally , some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions whereby a counterparty may demand additional
collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to
determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.
5. Fair Value Measurements
The fair value of assets and liabilities are determined using either unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or pricing
inputs that are observab le (Level 2) whenever that information is available and using unobserva ble inputs (Level 3) to estimate fair
value only when relevan t observable inputs are not available. NEE and FPL use several different valuation techniques to measure
the fair value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for
identical and/or comparable assets and liabilities for those assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
NEE's and FPL's assessment of the significance of any particular input to the fair value measu rement requires judgment and may
affect placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. Non-performance risk, including the consideration of a credit valuation
adjustment, is also considered in the determination of fair value for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Cash Equivalents  and Restricted Cash Equivalents - NEE and FPL hold investments in money market funds. The fair value of these
funds is estimated using a market approach based on current observable market prices.
Special Use Funds and Other Investments - NEE and FPL hold primarily debt and equity securities directly , as well as indirectly
through commingled funds. Substantially all directly held equity securities are valued at their quoted market prices. For directly held
debt securities, multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider
validations. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue of each security. Commingled funds, which are
similar to mutual funds, are maintained by banks  or investment companies and hold certain inves tments in accordance with a stated
set of objectives. The fair value of commingled funds is primarily derived from the quoted prices  in active markets of the underlying
securities. Because the fund shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active
market.
Derivative Instruments  - NEE and FPL measu re the fair value of commodity contracts using a combination of market and income
approaches utilizing prices observed on commo dities exchanges and in the OTC markets, or through the use of industry-standard
valuation techniques, such as option model ing or discounted cash flows techniques, incorporating both observable and
unobservable valuation inputs. The resulting measurements are the best estimate of fair value as represented by the transfer of the
asset or liability through an orderly transaction in the marketplace at the measurement date.
Most exchange-traded derivative assets and liabilities are valued directly using unadjusted quoted prices. For exchange-traded
derivative assets and liabilities where the principal market is deemed to be inactive based on average daily volumes and open
interest, the measureme nt is established using settlement prices from the exchanges, and there fore considered to be valued using
other observable inputs.
NEE, throug h its subsidiaries, including FPL, also enters into OTC commodity contract derivatives. The majority of these contracts
are transacted at liquid trading points, and the prices for these contracts are verified using quoted prices in active markets from
exchanges, brokers or pricing services for similar contracts.
NEE, through NEER, also enters into full requir ements contracts, which, in most cases, meet the definition of derivatives and are
measured at fair value. These contracts typically have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation
of the contract. In addition, certain exchange and non-exchange traded derivative options at NEE have one or more significant inputs
that are not observable, and are valued using industry-standard option models.
In all cases where NEE and FPL use significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of a commodity contract, consideration is given
to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability . The primary input to the valuation models for
commodity contracts is the forward commodity curve for the respective instruments. Other inputs include, but are not limited to,
assumptions about market liquidity , volatility , correlation and contract duration as more fully described below in Significant
Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements. In instances where the reference markets are deemed to be
inactive or do not have transactions for a similar contract, the derivative assets and liabilities may be valued using significant other
observable inputs and potentially significant unobservable inputs. In such instances, the valuation for these contracts is established
using techni ques including extrapolation from or interpolation between actively traded contracts, or estimated basis adjustments from
liquid trading points. NEE and FPL regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to determine fair value by a number of methods,
consisting of various market price verification procedures, including the use of pricing services and multiple broker quotes to support
the market price of the various commodities. In all cases where there are assumptions and models used to generate inputs for
valuing deriv ative asset s and liabilities, the review and verification of the assumptions, mode ls and changes to the models are
undertaken by individuals that are independent of those responsible for estimating fair value.
NEE uses interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts to mitigate and adjust interest rate and foreign currency exchange
exposure related primarily to certain outstandin g and expected future debt issuances and borrowings when deemed appropriate
based on market conditions or when required by financing agreements. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an
income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and
outflows related to the agreements.

Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements  - The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires
the use of significant unobservable inputs. All forward price, implied volatility , implied correlation and interest rate inputs used in the
valuation of such contra cts are directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quote s and exchange settlements, when
that data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that
maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some
forward prices, implied volatilities and interest rates used for determining fair value are update d daily to reflect the best available
market information. Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility
curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable
forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data. Other unobservable inputs, such as implied correlations,
block-to-hourly price shaping, customer migration rates from full requirements contracts and some implied volatility curves, are
modeled using proprietary models based on historical data and industry standard techniques.
All price (including block -to-hourly price shaping), volatility , correlation and customer migration inputs used in valuation are subject to
validation by the Trading Risk Management group. The Trading Risk Management group performs a risk management function
responsible for assessing credit, market and operational risk impact, reviewing valuation meth odology and modeling, confirming
transactions, monitoring approval processes and developing and monitoring trading limits. The Trading Risk Management group is
88

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
separate from the transacting group. For markets where independent third-party data is readily available, validation is conducted
daily by directly reviewin g this market data against inputs utilized by the transacting group, and indirectly by reviewing daily risk
reports. For markets where independent third-p arty data is not readily available, additional analytical reviews are performed on at
least a quarterly basis. These analytical reviews are designed to ensure that all price and volatility curves used for fair valuing
transactions are adequately validated each quarter, and are reviewed and approved by the Trading Risk Management group. In
addition, other valuation assumptions such as implied correlations and customer migration rates  are reviewed and approved by the
Trading Risk Management group on a periodic basis. Newly created models used in the valuation  process are also subject to testing
and approval by the Trading Risk Management group prior to use and established models are reviewed annually , or more often as
needed, by the Trading Risk Management group.
On a month ly basis, the Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management,
meets with representativ es from the Trading Risk Management group and the transacting group to discuss NEE's and FPL's energy
risk profile and operations, to review risk reports and to discuss fair value issues as necessary . The EMC develops guidelines
required for an appropriate risk management control infrastructure, which includes implementation and monitoring of compliance
with Trading Risk Management policy . The EMC executes its risk management responsibilities through direct oversight and
delegation of its responsibilities to the Trading Risk Management group, as well as to other corporate and business unit personnel.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of NEE's commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 of the fair value

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  - NEE tests long-lived assets for recovera bility whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  may not be recoverable. A wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources
has a powe r purchase agreement (PPA) with Duane Arnold's primary customer for the energ y and capacity related to its 70%
ownership share of Duan e Arnold that was set to expire on December 31, 2025. NEER had previ ously expected Duane Arnold would
operate at least until the end of its NRC operating license in February 2034. In early December  2017, NEER concluded that it was
unlikely that Duane Arnold's primary customer would extend the current PPA after it was set to expire in 2025. Without the long-term
cash flow certainty of a PPA for Duane Arnold's energy and capacity , NEER would likely close Duane Arnold on or about December
31, 2025, the end of the term of the PPA. As a result of the change in Duane Arnold's useful life, NEER updated depreciation and
ARO estimates to reflect the December 31, 2025 closure. A recoverability analysis perform ed by NEER determined that the
undiscounted cash flows of Duane Arnold were less than its carrying amount and, accordingly , NEER performed a fair value analysis
to determine the amou nt of the impairment. Based on the fair value analysis, long-lived assets (primarily property , plant and
equipment) with a carryi ng amount of approximately $502 million  were written  down to their fair value of $82 million , resul ting in an
impairment of $420 million  ($258 million  after tax), which is included in impairment charges in NEE's consolidated statements of
income for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The estimate of fair value was based on a combination of the income and market
value approa ches. The income approach utilized  a discounted cash flow valuation technique considering contracted revenue rates
(Level 2), annual genera tion forecasts, annual projected capital and maintenance expenditures and a discount rate (all of which are
Level 3). The market value approach utilized a transaction involving a comparable nuclear power plant sale in March 2017 and
adjusted for certain entity specific assumptions (Level 3). In January 2019, an amendment to the PPA with Duane Arnold's primary
customer became effective which shortened the term of the PPA by five years and results  in the PPA expiring on December 31,
2020. Operations of Duane Arnold are expected to cease in late 2020.

operations, changes in fair value of debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for unrealized losses
considered to be other than temporary , including any credit losses, which are recognized in other - net in NEE's consolidated
statements of income. For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, changes in fair value of equity securities are recorded in change in
unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds - net in NEE's consolidated statements
of income.
The unrealiz ed gains (losses) recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019  and 2018  on equity securities held at
December 31, 2019  and 2018  were $780 million ($510 million for FPL) and $(259) million ($(131) million for FPL), respectively . Debt
securities included in the nuclear decommissioning funds have a weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2019  of approximately
eight years at both NEE and FPL. FPL's storm fund primarily consists of debt securities with a weighted-average maturity at
December 31, 2019  of approximately one year . The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.

Regulations issued by the FERC and the NRC provide general risk management guidelines to protect nuclear decommissioning
funds and to allow such funds to earn a reasona ble return. The FERC regulations prohibit, among other investments, investments in
any securities of NEE or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding investments tied to market indices or mutual funds.
Similar restrictions applicable to the decommiss ioning funds for NEER's nuclear plants are included in the NRC operating licenses
for those facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in cost-of-service environments. With respect to the
decommissioning fund for Seabrook, decommissioning fund contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the NDFC pursuant
to New Hampshire law .
The nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who must comply with the guidelines of NEE
and FPL and the rules of the applicable regulato ry authorities. The funds' assets are invested giving consideration to taxes, liquidity ,
risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.
6. Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017,  tax reform legislation was signed into law which, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income
tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, NEE, including FPL, revalued its deferred income taxes as of
December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the revaluation reduced NEE’ s net deferred income  tax liabilities by approximately $6.5
billion , of which $4.5 billion related to net deferred income tax liabilities at FPL and the remaining $2 billion related to net deferred
income tax liabilities at NEER. The $2 billion reduc tion in NEER’ s deferred income tax liabiliti es increased NEER’ s 2017 net income.
The $4.5 billion reduction in FPL’s deferred income tax liabilities was recorded as a regulatory liability . The U.S. Department of
Treasury has also released proposed regulations related to the business interest expense limitations and foreign tax credits
associated with tax reform. These proposed regulations are not final and are subject to change in the regulatory review process.
The components of income taxes are as follows:

8. Acquisitions
Gulf Power Company - On January 1, 2019, NEE acquired the outstanding common shares of Gulf Power , a rate-regulated electric
utility under the jurisdiction of the FPSC. Gulf Power serves approximately 470,000  customers in eight  counties throughout
northwest Florida, has approximately 9,500  miles of transmission and distribution lines and owns approximately 2,300  MW of net
generating capacity . The purchase price included approximately $4.44 billion in cash consideration  and the assumption of
approximately $1.3 billion of Gulf Power debt. The cash purchase price was funded through $4.5 billion of borrowing s by NEECH in
December 2018 under certain short-term bi-lateral term loan agreements; the proceeds of which borrowings were restricted and
included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Such borrowings were repaid in
April 2019.
Under the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on January 1, 2019
based on their fair value . The approval by the FPSC of Gulf Power's rates, which is intended to allow Gulf Power to collect from retail
customers total revenues equal to Gulf Power's costs of providing service, including a reasonab le rate of return on invested capital,
is considered a fundamental input in measuring the fair value of Gulf Power's assets and liabilities and, as such, NEE concluded that
the carrying  values of all assets and liabilities recoverable through rates are representative of their fair values. As a result, NEE
acquired assets of approximately $5.2 billion , prima rily relating to property , plant and equipme nt of $4.0 billion  and regulat ory assets
of $494 millio n, and assum ed liabilities of approximately $3.4 billion , including $1.3 billion  of long-term  debt, $635 millio n of
regulatory liabilities and $562 million of deferred income taxes. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in approximately $2.7 billion of goodwill which has been recognized on NEE's consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2019 . Goodwill associated with the Gulf Power acquisition is reflected within Corporate and Other
and, for impairment testing, is included in the Gulf Power reporting unit. The goodwill arisin g from the transaction represents
expected benefits from continued expansion of NEE's regulated businesses and the indefinite life of Gulf Power's service territory
franchise.
Trans Bay Cable, LLC - On July 16, 2019, a wholly owned subsidiary  of NEET  acquired the membership interests of Trans Bay
Cable, LLC (Trans Bay), which owns and operates a 53-mile, high-v oltage direc t current underwater transmission cable system in
California extending from Pittsburg to San Francisco, with utility rates set by the FERC and revenues paid by the California
Independent System Operator . The purchase price included approximately $670 million  in cash consideration and the assumption of
debt of approximately $422 million .
Under the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair
value. The approval by the FERC of Trans Bay’s rates, which is intended to allow Trans Bay to collect total revenues equal to Trans
Bay's costs for the development, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of Trans Bay, including a reasonable rate of
return on invested capita l, is considered a fundamental input in measuring the fair value of Trans Bay's assets and liabilities and, as
such, NEE concluded that the carrying values of all assets and liabilities recoverable through rates are representative of their fair
values. As a result, NEE acquired assets of approximately $703 millio n, prima rily relating to property , plant and equipm ent, and
assumed liabilities of approximately $643 million , prima rily relating to long-term debt. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  resulted in approximately $610 million  of goodwill which has been recognized on
NEE's conso lidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 , of which approximately $572 million  is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. Goodwill associated with the Trans Bay acquisition is reflected within NEER and, for impairment testing, is included in the
rate-regulated transmission reporting unit. The goodwill arising from the transaction represents expected benefits from continued
expansion of NEE's regulated businesses. The valuation of the acquired net assets is subject to change as NEE obtains additional
information for its estimates during the measurement period.
Other - In July 2018, NEE acquired the outstanding common shares of the entity that owns Florida City Gas (FCG), which serves
approximately 110,000  residential and commercial natural gas customers in Florida's Miami-Dade, Brevard, St. Lucie  and Indian
River counties with 3,700  miles of natural gas pipeline, for approximately $530 million in cash subject to certain adjustments. Upon
closing, NEE transferred FCG to FPL.
In December 2018, NEE acquired a 100% interest in an entity that indirectly owns Oleand er Power Project, an approximately 791
MW natural gas-fired, simple-cycle combustion turbine electric generation facility located near Cocoa, Florida, and a 100% interest in
an entity that owns a 65% interest in Stanton Energy Center Unit A, an approximately 660 MW combined-cycle electric generation
facility located near Orlando, Florida for approximately $200 million  in cash, subject to certain adjustments.
Santee Cooper - On February 11, 2020, the South Carolina Department of Administration (DOA) announced that it had selected
NEE as the recommend ed bidder for the sale case in its evaluation process with respect to the South Carolina Public Service
Authority , South Carolina's state-owned electric and water utility (Santee Cooper). NEE’ s proposal provides for the payment of
approximately $8.5 billion in cash to repay existing  Santee Cooper debt and provide additional proceeds. In addition, NEE' s proposal
provides approximately $941 million  in refunds to Santee Cooper customers. The proposed purchase, which would be structured as
an asset purchase, is subject to, among other things, the South Carolina General Assembly enac ting a joint resolution approving the
proposed purchase, the enactment of comprehensive enabling legislation as South Carolina law, the execution of a definitive asset
purchase agreement and the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

9. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
At December 31, 2019 , NEE had 33 VIEs which it consolidated and had interests in certain other VIEs which it did not consolidate.
FPL - FPL is considered the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, a VIE that is a wholly owned bankruptcy remote
special purpose subsidiary that it formed in 2007  for the sole purpose of issuing storm-recovery bonds pursuant to the securitization
provisions of the Florida Statutes and a financing  order of the FPSC. FPL is considered the prima ry beneficiary because FPL has the
power to direct the significant activities of the VIE, and its equity investment, which was subordinate to the bondholder's interest in
the VIE, was at risk. Storm restoration costs incurred by FPL during 2005 and 2004 exceeded the amount in FPL's funded storm and
property insurance reserve, resulting in a storm reserve deficiency . In 2007, the VIE issued $652 million  aggregate principal amount
of senior secured bonds (storm-recovery bonds), primarily for the after-tax equivalent of the total of FPL's unrecovered balance of
the 2004 storm restoratio n costs, the 2005 storm restoration costs and to reestablish FPL's storm  and property insurance reserve. In
connection with this financing, net proceeds, after debt issuance costs, to the VIE (approximately  $644 million ) were  used to acquire
the storm-recovery property , which included the right to impose, collect and receive a storm-recovery charge from all customers
receiving electric transmission or distribution service from FPL under rate schedules approved by the FPSC or under special
contracts, certain other rights and interests that arose under the financing order issued by the FPSC and certain other collateral
pledged by the VIE that issued the bonds. The storm-recovery bonds were payable only from and were secured by the storm-
recovery property , and the final payment was made in August 2019. The bondholders had no recourse to the general credit of FPL.
The assets and liabilities of the VIE were approximately $77 million and $76 million, respectively , at December 31, 2018 , and
consisted primarily of storm-recovery property , which were included in current regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated
balance sheet and storm-recovery bonds, which were included in current portion of long-term debt on NEE's and FPL's consolidated
balance sheet.
NEER  - NEE consolidates 32 VIEs within  the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered the primary
beneficiary of these VIEs since they control the most significant activities of these VIEs, includin g operations and maintenance, and
they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.
NextEra Energy Resources consolidates two VIEs which own and operate natural gas/oil electric generation facilities with the
capability of producing 1,450  MW. These  entities sell their electric output under power sales contracts to third parties, with expiration
dates in 2021  and 2031 . The power sales contra cts provide the offtaker the ability to dispatch the facilities and require the offtaker to
absorb the cost of fuel. The assets and liabilities of these two VIEs were approximately $216 million  and $25 million , respe ctively , at
December 31, 2019 . These two VIEs,  togeth er with a third VIE that consolidated two separate NEER entities, collectively had assets
and liabilities that totale d $257 million  and $21 million , respe ctively , at December 31, 2018 . At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the
assets of these consolidated VIEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment.
Three  indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resour ces have an approximately 50% ownership  interest in five entities which own
and operate  solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities with the capability of producing a total of approxi mately 409 MW. Each of the three
subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is
consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These five entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts
with expiration dates ranging from 2035  through 2042 . The five entitie s have third-party  debt which is secured by liens against the
assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of
debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $776 million  and $598 million , respe ctively , at December 31, 2019 .
There were two consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2018  which owned three  entities which had assets and liabilities of $529 million
and $557 million, respectivel y. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the assets and liabilitie s of the VIEs consisted primarily of property ,
plant and equipment and long-term debt.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, NEE consolidates a NEET  VIE that is constructing an approximately 275-mile electricity
transmission line. The NEET subsidiary is the primary beneficiary and controls the most significant activities during the construction
period, including controlling the construction budget. Prior to the construction period, the entity was jointly controlled and was
accounted for under the equity method. NEET  is entitled to receive 50% of the profits and losses of the entity . At December 31,
2019 , the assets and liabilities of the VIE totaled $173 million  and $29 million , respectively .
The other 26 NextEra Energy Resources VIEs that are consolidated relate to certain subsidiaries which have sold differential
membership interests in entities which own and operate wind electric generation and solar PV facilities with the capability of
producing a total of approximately 7,081  MW and 473 MW, respectively . Thes e entities sell their electric output either under power
sales contra cts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2029  through 2053  or in the spot market. These entities are
considered VIEs because the holders of differential membership interests do not have substantive rights over the significant
activities of these entitie s. Certain entities have  third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the
other assets of these entities or by pledges of NextEra Energy Resources' ownership interest  in these entities. The debt holders
have no recourse to the general credit of NEER for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs totaled
approximately $11.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively , at December 31, 2019 . There were 25 consolidated VIEs at December 31,
2018 , and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs totaled approximately $10.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respe ctively . At December 31,
2019  and 2018 , the assets and liabilities of the VIEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment and long-term debt.

Other  - At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , several NEE subsidiari es had investments totaling approximately $3,247  million  ($2,717
million  at FPL) and $2,668  million ($2,203  million at FPL), respectively , which are included in spec ial use funds and noncurrent other
assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments
represented primarily commingled funds and mortgage-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary
beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these
entities, were not involved in the initial design of these entities and do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities.
Certain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's
noncontrolling interest in NEP OpCo. These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners
or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are
considered VIEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and
therefore does not cons olidate any of these entities. NEE’ s investment in these entities totaled approximately $4,254  millio n and
$4,680  million  at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respe ctively . At December 31, 2019 , subs idiaries of NEE had commitments to invest
additional amounts in five of the entities. Such commitments are included in the NEER amounts in the table in Note 15 - Contracts.
10. Investments in Partnerships and Joint Ventures
Certain subs idiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in various partnerships and joint ventures, essentially all of which own or
are in the process of developing natural gas pipelines or own electric generation facilities. At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , NEE's
investments in partnerships and joint ventures  totaled approximately $7,453  millio n and $6,748  millio n, respectively , which are
included in investment in equity method investee s on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. NEE's interest in these partnerships and
joint ventures primarily range from approximately 31% to 61%. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the princip al entities included in
NEE's investments in partnerships and joint ventures were NEP OpCo, Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail) and Mountain
Valley Pipeline, LLC, and in 2019 also included Silver State South Solar , LLC.

NextEra Energy Resources provides management, administrative and transportation and fuel management services to NEP and its
subsidiaries under various agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit
support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of NEP. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the cash sweep amount (due to NEP and its
subsidiaries) held in accounts belonging to NextEra Energy Resources or its subsidiaries was approximately $12 million and $66
million , respectively , and is included in accounts payable. Fee income totaling approximately $101 million  and $94 million ,
respectively , related to the CSCS agreement and the service agreements is included in operating revenues in NEE's consolidated

______________________
(a)The 2018 adjustment is related to both the NEP Series A convertible preferred units and the NEP senior unsecured convertible notes (see Potentially Dilutive
Securities at NEP below).
(b)Calculated using the treasury stock method. Performance share awards are included in diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding based
upon what would be issued if the end of the reporting period was the end of the term of the award.
Common shares issuable pursuant to stock options, performance share awards and/or equity units, as well as restricted stock which
were not included in the denominator above due to their antidilutive effect were approximately 0.7 million , 0.1 million  and 3.1 million
for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively .
Potentially Dilutive Securities at NEP - In Novemb er 2017, NEP issued approximately  $550 million  of Series A convertible preferred
units represe nting limited partner interests in NEP (NEP  preferred units). Holders of NEP prefer red units  may elect to convert all or
any portion of their NEP preferred units into common units of NEP at any time after June 20, 2019 subject to certain conditions. NEP
may elect to convert all or any portion of the NEP preferred units that remain outstanding into NEP common units on or after
November 15, 2020 if certain conditions are met. At December 31, 2019 , the value of the NEP preferred units outstand ing was
approximately $183 million. In addition, NEP has senior unsecured convertible notes outstanding of $300 million at December 31,
2019 . Holders of these notes may convert all or any portion of the notes into NEP common units. The NEP preferred units and NEP
senior unsecured convertible notes are potentially dilutive securities to NEE.

Forward Sale Agreements  - In November 2016, NEE entered into forward sale agreements with several forward counterp arties for
12 million  shares of its common stock to be settled on a date or dates to be specified at NEE’ s direction, no later than
November 1, 2017. During 2017, NEE issued 1,711,345  shares of its common stock to net share settle the forward sale agreements.
The forward sale price used to determine the net share settlement amount was calculated base d on the initial forward sale price of
$124.00  per share, less certain adjustments as specified in the forward sale agreements.
Common Stock Dividend Restrictions  - NEE's charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. FPL's
mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends
and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.
Stock-Based Compensa tion - Net income for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017  includ es approximately $100
million , $82 million and $76 million, respectivel y, of compensation costs and $17 million, $21 million and $29 million, respectivel y, of
income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended
December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017  was not material. At December 31, 2019 , there  were approxim ately $112 millio n of
unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensat ion arrangements. These costs are
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.
At December 31, 2019 , approximately 15 million  shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and
non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) Amended and Restated 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b)
2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance
under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and
performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open
market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-
based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year .
Restricted Stock and Performance Share Award s - Restricted stock typica lly vests within three years  after the date of grant and is
subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based
upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the
end of a three -year performance period if the specified perform ance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance
share award s is estimated based upon the closin g market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value
of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual
performance.

Options - Options typically vest within three years  after the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years . The exercise price
of each optio n granted equals the closing marke t price of NEE common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of the options is

(a)Includes variable rate tax exempt bonds that permit individual bondholders to tender the bonds for purchase at any time prior to maturity. In the event these variable
rate tax exempt bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the
remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL or Gulf Power, as the case may be, would be required to purchase the variable rate tax exempt bonds. At December 31, 2019,
variable rate tax exempt bonds totaled approximately $948 million at FPL and $269 million at Gulf Power. All variable rate tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase
have been successfully remarketed. FPL's and Gulf Power's syndicated revolving credit facilities, as the case may be, are available to support the purchase of the

Minimum annual maturities of long -term debt for NEE are approximately $2,124  million, $4,323  million, $4,134  million, $1,700  million
and $3,380  million  for 2020 , 2021 , 2022 , 2023  and 2024 , respectively . The respective amounts for FPL are approximately $30
million , $68 million , $1,120  million , $537 million  and $672 million .
At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , short-term borrowings had a weighted-average  interest rate of 1.95% (1.80% for FPL) and 2.95%
(2.87% for FPL), respectively . Subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, had credit facilities with available capacity at December 31, 2019
of approxima tely $10.8 billion ($3.6 billion for FPL), of which approximately $10.7 billion ($3.6 billion for FPL) relate to revolving line
of credit facilities and $0.1 billion (none  for FPL) relate to letter  of credit facilities. Certain of the revolving line of credit facilities
provide for the issuance of letters of credit at December 31, 2019  of up to approximately $2.3 billion ($0.6 billion for FPL). The
issuance of letters of credit under certain revol ving line of credit facilities is subject to the aggregate commitment of the relevant
banks to issue letters of credit under the applicable facility . In January 2020, FPL repaid comm ercial paper of approximately $1.2
billion  with proceeds from a capital contribution from NEE.
NEE has guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of those under NEECH's debt, including all of its
debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications. NEECH has
guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER segment.
In August 2018, NEEC H completed a remark eting of approximately $700 millio n aggregate principal amount of its Series H
Debentures due September 1, 2020 (Series H Debentures) that were issued in September 2015 as components of equity units
issued concurrently by NEE (September 2015 equity units). The Series H Debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
NEE. In connection with the remarketing of the Series H Debentures, the interest rate on the Series H Debentures was reset to
3.342 % per year, and interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing September 1, 2018. In connection
with the settlement of the contracts to purchase NEE common stock that were issued as components of the September 2015 equity
units, in the third quarter of 2018, NEE issued 6,215,998  shares of common stock in exchange for $700 million .
In August 2019, NEEC H completed a remarketing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its Series I Debentures due
September 1, 2021 (Series I Debentures) that were issued in August 2016 as components of equity units issued concurrently by
NEE (August 2016 equity units). The Series I Debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE. In connection with the
remarketing of the Serie s I Debentures, the interest rate on the Series I Debentures was reset to 2.403 % per year, and interest is
payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing September 1, 2019. In connection with the settlement of the
contracts to purchase NEE common stock that were issued as components of the August 2016  equity units, in the third quarter of
2019, NEE issued 9,543,000  shares of common stock in exchange for $1.5 billion .
In September 2019, NEE sold $1.5 billion of equity units (initially  consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated
amount of $50 and consist s of a contr act to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially , a 5% undivided
beneficial ownership interest in a Series J Debenture due September 1, 2024, issued in the principal amount of $1,000  by NEECH.
Each stock purchase contract requires the holde r to purchase by no later than September 1, 2022 (the final settlement date) for a
price of $50 in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments) based on a price per share
range of $224.12  to $280.15 . If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2019 , the number of shares issued
would (subje ct to antidilution adjustments) range  from 0.2231  shares if the applicable market value of a share of common stock is
less than or equal to $224.12  to 0.1785  shares if the applicable  market value of a share is equal to or greater than $280.15 , with
applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a 20-day trading period
ending Augu st 29, 2022. Total annual distribut ions on the equity units are at the rate of 4.872 %, consisting of interest on the
debentures (2.10% per year) and paymen ts under the stock purchase contracts (2.772 % per year). The interes t rate on the
debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2022. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with
proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest
in the NEECH debenture  that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure  the holder's obligation to purchase
NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third
business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract
with cash, the debentur es that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to
purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.
Prior to the issuance of NEE’s common stock, the stock purchase contracts, if dilutive, will be reflected in NEE’ s diluted earnings per
share calcul ations using  the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of NEE common stock used in
calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued
upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purch ased by NEE in the market, at the
average market price during the period, using the proceeds receivable upon settlement.

NEE and FPL have identified but not recognized ARO liabilities related to the majority of their electric transmission and distribution
assets and pipelines resulting from easements over property not owned by NEE or FPL. These easements are generally perpetual
and only require retirem ent action upon abandonment or cessation of use of the property or facility for its specified purpose. The
related ARO  liability is not estimable for such easements as NEE and FPL intend to use these properties indefinitely . In the event
NEE and FPL  decide to abandon or cease the use of a particular easement, an ARO liability would be recorded at that time.
14. Leases
NEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to purchased power agreements, land use agreements that convey
exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy proje cts and substations, buildings and
equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2020  to 2052 ,
with the exception of operating leases related to three  land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106 , some of which include
options to extend the leases up to 27 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. At December 31, 2019 , NEE’ s
ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $499 million  and $498 million , respectively; the
respective amounts at December 31, 2018  were $133 million  and $141 million . At December 31, 2019 , NEE’ s ROU assets and lease
liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately  $62 million  and $56 million , respe ctively; the respec tive amounts at December 31,
2018  were $68 million  and $63 million . NEE’s lease liabilities at December 31, 2019  and 2018  were calcul ated using a weighted-
average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.73% and 4.31%, respe ctively , for operat ing leases and 3.15% and
2.72%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 31 years and 19 years, respectively , for
operating leases and 14 years and 10 years, respectively , for finance leases. At December 31, 2019 , expected lease payments over
the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $981 million  with no one year being material. NEE's operating lease cost for
the
104

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
year ended December 31, 2019 totaled approxim ately $91 million . Durin g the year ended  December 31, 2019 , NEE's ROU  assets
obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations totaled approximately $450 million  and primarily relate to leases acquired with
the Gulf Power and Trans Bay acquisitions (see Note 8). Other operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to
NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.
NEE has sales-type leases primarily related to a natural gas and oil electric generation facility and certain battery storage facilities
that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the
facilities. At December 31, 2019  and 2018 , NEE record ed a net investment in sales-type leases of approximately $50 million  and $69
million , respective ly, and losses at commencement of sales-type leases due to the variable natur e of the lease payments of
approximately $20 million  for the year ended December 31, 2018 , which are recorded in gains on disposal of businesses/assets -
net in NEE's  consolidate d statements of income . At December 31, 2019 , the power sales agree ments have expiration dates from
2021  to 2043  and NEE expects to receive approximately $150 millio n of lease payments over the remaining terms of the power
sales agreements with no one year being material.
15. Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments  - NEE and its subsid iaries have made commitments in connection with a portion of their projected capital
expenditures. Capital expenditures at FPL and Gulf Power include, among other things, the cost for construction of additional
facilities and equipment to meet customer demand, as well as capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities. At
NEER, capital expenditures include, among other things, the cost, including capitalized interest, for construction and development of
wind and solar projects,  the procurement of nuclear fuel and the cost to maintain existing rate-regulated transmission facilities, as
well as equity contributio ns to joint ventures for the development and construction of natural gas pipeline assets and a rate-regulated
transmission facility .
At December 31, 2019 , estim ated capital expenditures for 2020  through 2024  for which applicable internal approvals (and also, if

(a)Includes approximately $385 million, $415 million, $415 million, $410 million, $410 million and $6,765 million in 2020 through 2024 and thereafter, respectively, of
firm commitments related to the natural gas transportation agreements with Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, LLC. The charges associated with these
agreements are recoverable through the fuel clause and totaled approximately $316 million and $303 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, of which $108 million and $95 million, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation at NEE.      
(b)Includes approximately $70 million, $70 million, $70 million, $70 million and $1,110 million for 2021 through 2024 and thereafter, respectively, of firm commitments
related to a natural gas transportation agreement with a joint venture, in which NEER has a 31% equity investment, that is constructing a natural gas pipeline. These

Insurance  - Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear
reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an indus try retrospective payment plan. In
accordance with this Act, NEE maintains $450 million  of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, and
participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $13.5 billion of liability insurance coverage per incident
at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of
up to $1.1 billion ($550 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate
not to exceed $164 million  ($82 million  for FPL) per incident per year. NEE and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a
proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2,
which approximates $ 16 million , $41 million  and $ 20 million , plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively .
NEE particip ates in a nuclear insurance mutual company that provides $2.75 billion of limited insurance coverage per occurrence
per site for property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning risks at its nuclear plants and a sublimit of $1.5
billion  for non-nuclear perils, except for Duane Arnold which has a sublimit of $500 million . NEE participates in co-insurance of 10%
of the first $400 million  of losses per site per occurrence. The proceeds from such insurance, however , must first be used for reactor
stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for plant repair . NEE also participates in an insurance program that
provides limited coverag e for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of
an accident.  In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up
to $174 million ($106 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NEE and FPL are
contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook,
Duane Arno ld and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $3 million, $4 million and $4 million, plus any applicable taxes,
respectively .
Due to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a
substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If either FPL's or Gulf Power's
future storm  restoration costs exceed their respe ctive storm reserve, FPL and Gulf Power may recover their storm restoration costs,
subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to
Florida law . See Note 1 - Storm Fund, Storm Reserve and Storm Cost Recovery .
In the event  of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses
incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL or Gulf Power , would
be borne by NEE and either FPL or Gulf Power , and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition,
results of operations and liquidity .

As of December 31, 2019 , each of NEE and FPL had performed an evalua tion, under the supervision and with the participation of its
management, including NEE's and FPL's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of each compa ny's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e)

Item 14.  Principal Accounting Fees and Services
NEE - The information requi red by this item will be included in NEE's Proxy Statement under the heading "Audit-Related Matters"
and is incorporated herein by reference.
FPL - The following table presents fees billed for professional services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of
Deloitte Touche Tohmats u, and their respective affiliates (collectively , Deloitte & Touche) for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2019  and 2018 . The amounts presented below reflect allocations from NEE for FPL's portion of the fees, as well as amounts billed
directly to FPL.
 2019 2018
Audit fees(a)$ 3,621,000 $ 3,895,000
Audit-related fees(b)380,000 84,000
Tax fees(c)2,097,000 256,000
All other fees(d)15,000 7,000
Total $ 6,113,000 $ 4,242,000
______________________
(a)Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of FPL's and NEE's annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the
reviews of the financial statements included in FPL's and NEE's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during the fiscal year and the audit of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, comfort letters, and consents.
(b)Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of FPL's and NEE's
consolidated financial statements and are not reported under audit fees. These fees primarily relate to audits of subsidiary financial statements and attestation
services.
(c)Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. In 2019 and 2018, approximately $2,069,000 and
$36,000, respectively, was paid related to tax compliance services. In 2019, these fees primarily related to research and development tax credit compliance services.
All other tax fees in 2019 and in 2018 related to tax advice and planning services.
(d)All other fees consist of fees for products and services other than the services reported under the other named categories. In 2019 and 2018, these fees related to
training.
In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee Charter and the Audit Committee's
pre-approval policy for services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, all services performed by Deloitte &
Touche are approved in advance by the Audit Committee, except for audits of certain trust funds where the fees are paid by the trust.
Audit and audit-related services specifically identified in an appendix to the pre-approval policy are pre-approved by the Audit
Committee each year. This pre-approval allows management to request the specified audit and audit-related services on an as-
needed basis during the year, provided any such services are reviewed with the Audit Commi ttee at its next regularly scheduled
meeting. Any audit or audit-related service for which the fee is expected to exceed $250,000, or that involves a service not listed on
the pre-approval list, must be specifically approv ed by the Audit Committee prior to commencem ent of such service. In addition, the
Audit Comm ittee approves all services other than audit and audit-related services performed by Deloitte & Touche in advance of the
commencement of such work. The Audit Comm ittee has delegated to the Chair of the committee the right to approve audit, audit-
related, tax and other services, within certain limitations, between meetings of the Audit Comm ittee, provided any such decision is
presented to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. At each Audit Committee meeting (other than meetings
held to review earnings  materials), the Audit Committee reviews a schedule of services for which Deloitte & Touche has been
engaged since the prior Audit Committee meeting under existing pre-approvals and the estimat ed fees for those services. In 2019
and 2018 , none  of the amounts presented above represent services provided to NEE or FPL by Deloitte & Touche that were
approved by the Audit Committee after services were rendered pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C ) of Regulation S-X  (which provi des
for a waiver of the otherwise applicable pre-approval requirement if certain conditions are met).
