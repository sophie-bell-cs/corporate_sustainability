The Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating
facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources
of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of
the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission
system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System – Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power"
herein.
Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered
into for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into
various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review
of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance
I-1
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The
traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further the
reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at
the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. On November 9, 2022, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM)
began service. SEEM, whose members include the traditional electric operating companies and many of the other electric service
providers in the Southeast, is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants use an automated, intra-hour energy
exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. The FERC's
orders related to SEEM have been appealed. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated
as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are
administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The
fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an
effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service
requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized
economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost
energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use
in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern
Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations
thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions
with third parties.
Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are
furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's
existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to
develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation – Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional
information.
Southern Power
Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects,
and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks
opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of
partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for
differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with
investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and
industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under
long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating
companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric
transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's
future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets,
as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern
Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the
majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business
activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – OVERVIEW – "Business Activities" in Item 7 herein.
Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the
Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company
power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue power generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership
with various third parties. At December 31, 2022, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners,
totaled 12,501 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,121 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its
subsidiaries). See "Traditional Electric Operating Companies" herein for additional information on the Southern Company power
pool.
A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at
differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling partner and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the
partnerships. At December 31, 2022, Southern Power had eight tax equity partnership arrangements where the tax equity
I-2
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
investors receive substantially all of the tax benefits from the facilities, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power
holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.
See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions,
dispositions, construction, and development projects.
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners,
based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-
service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with
facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at
December 31, 2022 was 96% through 2027 and 90% through 2032, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately
12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 44% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated
counterparties, 43% were with BBB+ to BBB- or equivalent rated counterparties, and 11% were with unrated entities that either
have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two
types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all
or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit
or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern
Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from
Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the
requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to
recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on
investment.
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however,
these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable
facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result,
Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy
generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints,
and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the
renewable energy credits.
Southern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues
attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's
current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's
earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through
the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to
the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an
"all other" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including
storage operations and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. Prior to the sale of Sequent on
July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' other businesses also included wholesale gas services. See Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions,
including the sale of Sequent and the sale and pending sale of the remaining facilities within the storage operations business.
Gas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains 77,591
miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential,
commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves approximately 4.4 million customers across four states.
Gas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG
and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of
natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a
7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Gas pipeline investments also includes a 20% ownership
interest in the PennEast Pipeline project, which was cancelled in September 2021. For additional

Fuel Supply
Electric
The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal, as well
as nuclear for Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Southern Company – Electricity Business
– Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION
under "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for
information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2021 and
2022.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the
natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2023, SCS has contracted for 659 Bcf of natural gas supply
under agreements with remaining terms up to 11 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm
natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation,
and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.
The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their
2023 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications,
emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to
remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the
utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the
need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and
potential unit retirements and replacements. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are currently subject to renewable
portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable
regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers,
communities, employees, and other stakeholders. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama
Power – Environmental Accounting Order," "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans," and "Mississippi Power – Integrated
Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional information, including the Southern Company system's electric generating mix and
plans to retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services,
enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 12 years. Management believes suppliers have
sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the
permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in
rate schedules. See "Rate Matters – Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's
natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.
Natural Gas
Advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural
gas. Demand increases beginning in 2021 and continuing in 2022 resulted in price increases and high volatility, which has been
exacerbated by pipeline constraints and increased exports. The Henry Hub price averaged $6.38 per mmBtu in 2022. Current
forecasts for 2023 are approximately $3.30. Forward market prices for 2024 and beyond indicate expectations, absent unforeseen
developments, that prices will modestly increase. The potential for price increases, similar to those in 2022, and high volatility
remains. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and
approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas
I-5
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for Atlanta Gas Light and
Chattanooga Gas, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas
also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline
services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-
approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas
charged to customers for most of the natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of
company-owned storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, purchased storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply
sources, arranged by either transportation customers or Southern Company Gas. See Note 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for additional information on the sale of Sequent.

Competition
Electric
The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. The competition for
retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological
advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and
environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.
The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973.
Pursuant to standards set forth in this Act, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier.
Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a
connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the
supplier of its choice.
Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to
Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part
by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The
six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas
included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to
certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may
not be made unless the Mississippi PSC grants a CPCN. Areas included in a CPCN that are subsequently annexed to municipalities
may continue to be served by the holder of the CPCN, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On
the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by
the Mississippi PSC.
Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their
respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as
self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors. Further technological
advancements or the implementation of policies in support of alternative energy sources may result in further competition.
Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility
markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success
in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants,
availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.
As of December 31, 2022, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with seven industrial customers. Under the terms of
these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2022, Alabama Power purchased
approximately 68 million KWHs from such companies. The related costs were immaterial.
I-8
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power had contracts in effect to purchase generation from 39 small IPPs. During 2022, Georgia
Power purchased 6.1 billion KWHs from such companies at a cost of $298 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity
with five cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2022,
Georgia Power purchased 399 million KWHs at a cost of $37 million from these facilities.
As of December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the
terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2022, Mississippi Power did not make any such
purchases.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive
franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil
and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are
considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance.
Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation
phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen
energy source for the life of the equipment.
Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:
•changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;
•general economic conditions;
•energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;
•legislation and regulations, including certain bans on the use of natural gas in new or existing construction and
electrification initiatives;
•the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and
•technological or regulatory changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.
Southern Company Gas has natural gas-related programs that generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers
and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners
with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances.
Seasonality and Demand
The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. While the electric power
sales of some electric utilities peak in the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, during normal weather conditions,
the Southern Company system's electric power sales peak during both the summer and winter. In most of the areas Southern
Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of the Registrants in the
future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and
natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "General" and – RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS – "Southern Company Gas – Seasonality of Results" in Item 7 herein for information regarding trends in market
demand for electricity and natural gas and the impact of seasonality on Southern Company Gas' business, respectively.
Regulation
States
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their
respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and
regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except
for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See
"Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.
Federal Power Act
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are
all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and
accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at
cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The
I-9
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to
the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power
Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2022, among the hydroelectric
projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity
of 1.7 million KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially owned by Georgia
Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1.1 million KWs.
In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the
Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting
rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. In 2016, the FERC issued
an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance
also filed multiple appeals of the FERC's 2013 order for the new 30-year license and, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit vacated the order and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. Alabama Power continues to operate the
Coosa River developments under annual licenses issued by the FERC.
In November 2021, Alabama Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa
River. The current Harris Dam project license will expire on November 30, 2023.
In 2018, Georgia Power filed applications to surrender the Langdale and Riverview hydroelectric projects on the Chattahoochee
River upon their license expirations on December 31, 2023. Both projects together represent 1,520 KWs of Georgia Power's hydro
fleet capacity.
In December 2021, Georgia Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project on the Ocmulgee River.
The current Lloyd Shoals project license will expire on December 31, 2023.
Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2026, for the Rocky Mountain project, a pure pumped storage facility of
903,000 KW installed capacity. In December 2021, OPC, as an agent for co-licensees of the project, filed a notice of intent with the
FERC to relicense the project. An application to relicense the project is expected to be filed with the FERC by December 31, 2024.
See PROPERTIES – "Electric – Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2034-2066 for Alabama Power's projects and in the
years 2034-2060 for Georgia Power's projects.
Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may
relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the
original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the
net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other
property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain
requirements that could result in additional costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Regulation
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing
and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as
mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended,
and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment,
protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity
with antitrust laws.
The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. On August 31, 2022,
Southern Nuclear notified the NRC of its intent in 2025 to seek to renew the plant's licenses for an additional 20 years (through
2054 and 2058 for Units 1 and 2, respectively). The NRC licenses for Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037
and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively.
In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs
allowed full construction to begin. On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the COL
for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

herein for additional information.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
See "Construction Programs" herein, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
– "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein, and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" and Note 6
to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information concerning environmental laws and regulations impacting the
Registrants.
Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans
Electric
The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout
their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used
and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are also
of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges.
These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage
off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to
negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers, subject to final state PSC approval.
The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate
mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost
recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the
respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi
Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are
recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery
mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at
Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings.
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also
see "Integrated Resource Planning" herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized
by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval
must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The
contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically,
these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be
followed by the other wholesale customers.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory
agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction.
These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs,
including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer
consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution
utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption
changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural
gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set
by the Georgia PSC.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility,
allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation,
energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain
cost recovery mechanisms.
Integrated Resource Planning
Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it
maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7
herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of
the traditional electric operating companies, as well as a discussion of the Southern Company system's continued generating fleet
transition.
Alabama Power
Triennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning
process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-
side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric
service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet expected
customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs
any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing system in the usual course of business.
Alabama Power provided its most recent IRP to the Alabama PSC during 2022. On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved a
CCN authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. The transaction closed on
September 30, 2022. During 2022, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, which is expected to be placed in
service in November 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and
Necessity" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Georgia Power
Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service
needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must
certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of
actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from
recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. On July
21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, as modified by a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the
staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans" and " – Rate Plans" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional
information on the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which
allow Georgia Power to recover certain financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Mississippi Power
Triennially, Mississippi Power must file an IRP with the Mississippi PSC, as well as an update at approximately the mid-point of
the three-year cycle. The IRP must include long-term plans to best meet the needs of electric utility customers through a
combination of demand-side and supply-side resources and considering transmission needs. The IRP filing is not intended to
supplant or replace the Mississippi PSC's existing regulatory processes for petition and approval of CPCNs for new generating
resources. Mississippi Power's most recent IRP was filed in 2021 and the next IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2024.
Mississippi Power must also file an annual report on energy delivery improvements, the latest of which was filed on December 1,
2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Integrated Resource Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional
information.

Human Capital
Southern Company system management is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a sustainable workforce and aims to
foster a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and innovative culture. The Southern Company system's values – safety first, unquestionable
trust, superior performance, and total commitment – guide behavior. The Southern Company system had approximately 27,700
employees on its payroll at December 31, 2022 comprised of the following:
At December 31, 2022
Alabama Power 6,100
Georgia Power 6,600
Mississippi Power 1,000
Southern Power 500
Southern Company Gas 4,600
SCS 4,000
Southern Nuclear 3,800
PowerSecure and other 1,100
Total Southern Company system 27,700
(*)Numbers are rounded to 100s.
All Southern Company system employees are located within the United States. Part-time employees represent less than 1% of total
employees.
Southern Company system management values a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce. Southern Company's subsidiaries
have policies, programs, and processes to help ensure that all groups are represented, included, and fairly treated across all job
levels. The Southern Company Board of Directors and management believe that diversity is important to provide different
perspectives on risk, business strategy, and innovation. Southern Company management leads the Southern Company system's
diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and employee recruitment, retention, and development efforts. The Board, principally
through its Compensation and Talent Development Committee, oversees these efforts. Southern Company system management
utilizes its "Moving to Equity" initiative that focuses on five key areas: talent, work environment, supplier inclusion, civic
engagement, and community investment and social justice. This initiative demonstrates the Southern Company system's
commitments, highlights key results, and tracks progress on long-term goals.
Southern Company system management supports employee resource groups, diversity councils, mentoring programs, and inclusion
teams to provide formal networks of colleagues that can help promote belonging, improve employee retention, and support
development. At December 31, 2022, people of color and women represented 30% and 26%, respectively, of the Southern
Company system's workforce.
Southern Company system management recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining an appropriately qualified workforce.
Southern Company system management uses a variety of strategies to attract and retain talent, including working with high schools,
technical schools, universities, and military installations to fill many entry-level positions. The recruiting strategy also includes
partnerships with professional associations and local communities to recruit mid-career talent. The addition of external hires
augments the existing workforce to meet changing business needs, address any critical skill gaps, and supplement and diversify the
Southern Company system's talent pipeline.
The Southern Company system supports the well-being of its employees through a comprehensive total rewards strategy with three
measurable categories: physical, financial, and emotional well-being. The Southern Company system provides competitive salaries,
annual incentive awards for nearly all employees, and health, welfare, and retirement benefits. The Southern Company system has a
qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan and a qualified defined contribution, trusteed 401(k) plan which provides a
competitive company matching contribution. Substantially all Southern Company system employees are eligible to participate in
these plans. There are differences between the pension plan benefit formulas based on when and by which subsidiary an employee
is hired. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. At December 31, 2022, the average age of the Southern
Company system employees was 45 and the average tenure with the Southern Company system was 15 years. Turnover rate,
calculated as the percent of employees that terminated employment with the Southern Company system, including voluntary and
involuntary terminations and retirements, divided by total employees, was 8.9%.
Southern Company system management is committed to developing talent and helping employees succeed by providing
development opportunities along with purposeful people moves as part of individual development plans and succession planning
processes. The Southern Company system has multiple development programs, including programs targeted toward all(*)
I-13
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
employees, high potential employees, first-level managers, managers of managers, and executives. Additionally, Southern
Company system management strives to deliver consistent needs-based training and solutions as workplace needs evolve.
Southern Company system management believes the safety of employees and customers is paramount. The Southern Company
system seeks to meet or exceed applicable laws and regulations while continually improving its safety technologies and processes.
The Southern Company System Safety and Health Council, which includes leaders from each Registrant, works collectively across
the Southern Company system to provide safety leadership, share learning, work collaboratively to address safety-related issues,
and govern the consistency of safety programs. The safety programs are focused on the prevention and elimination of life-altering
events, serious injuries, and fatalities. These programs include continuous process improvements to put critical controls in place to
prevent serious injuries, promote learning, and implement appropriate corrective actions. In 2022, the Southern Company system
had zero fatalities and a serious injury rate of 0.05, which represents the number of incidents per 100 employees (calculated by
taking the number of serious injuries multiplied by 200,000 workhours and divided by the total employee workhours during the
year). A serious injury is one that is life-threatening or life-changing for the employee. Serious injury examples, as defined by
applicable safety regulators, include fatalities, amputations, trauma to organs, certain bone fractures, severe burns, and eye injuries.
The Southern Company system continues to provide essential services to customers while adapting to the impacts of the COVID-
19 pandemic. The Southern Company system has implemented applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal, state, and
local officials, and established protocols for required work on customer premises. To date, these procedures have been effective in
maintaining the Southern Company system's critical operations, while also emphasizing employee, customer, and community
safety.
The Southern Company system also has longstanding relationships with labor unions. The traditional electric operating companies,
Southern Nuclear, and the natural gas distribution utilities have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW, which
generally apply to operating, maintenance, and construction employees. These agreements cover wages, benefits, terms of the
pension plans, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and arbitration. The Southern Company system also
partners with the IBEW to provide training programs to develop technical skills and career opportunities.
At December 31, 2022, approximately 31% of Southern Company system employees were covered by agreements with unions,
with agreements expiring between 2024 and 2026.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS –
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries
with the SEC, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries. The risk factors discussed below could
adversely affect a Registrant's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, as well as cause
reputational damage.
UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKS
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial federal, state, and local governmental regulation,
including with respect to rates. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary
approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
Laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services the Southern Company system offers, protection of critical
electric infrastructure assets, transmission planning, reliability, pipeline safety, interaction with wholesale markets, and
relationships with affiliates, among other matters. The Registrants' businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result
in substantial monetary penalties if a Registrant is found to be noncompliant.
The profitability of the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' businesses is largely
dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover their costs and earn a reasonable rate of
return on invested capital. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities seek to recover their
costs, including a reasonable return on invested capital, through their retail rates, which must be approved by the applicable state
PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. Such regulators, in a future rate proceeding, may alter the timing or amount of
certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate refunds may also be required.
Additionally, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the
rates charged to natural gas transportation customers by Southern Company Gas' pipeline investments must be approved by the
FERC. Changes to Southern Power's and the traditional electric operating companies' ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC
market-based rate authority could affect wholesale rates. Also, while a small percentage of transmission revenues are collected
through wholesale electric tariffs, the majority are collected through retail rates. Transmission planning could be impacted by
FERC policy changes.
The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations
applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries is uncertain. Changes in regulation, the imposition of additional
regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for noncompliance with existing laws or
regulations could influence the operating environment of the Southern Company system and may result in substantial costs.
The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws and satisfying related AROs are significant.
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and
regulations governing air, GHGs, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources.
Compliance with existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs including the settlement of
AROs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates. There is no assurance, however,
that all such costs will be recovered. The Registrants expect future compliance expenditures will continue to be significant.
The EPA has adopted and is implementing regulations governing air and GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act and water quality
under the Clean Water Act. The EPA and certain states have also adopted and continue to propose regulations governing the
disposal and management of CCR at power plant sites. The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on
information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and
discount rates, and the potential compliance methods. The traditional electric operating companies will continue to periodically
update their ARO cost estimates.
Additionally, environmental laws and regulations covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances
could require the Southern Company system to incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites, including certain current and
former operating sites, and locations subject to contractual obligations.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements has occurred throughout the United States. This litigation has included, but is not
I-15
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
limited to, claims for damages alleged to have been caused by COand other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances,
alleged exposure to regulated substances, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.
Compliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Southern
Company system. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental
expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of
any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may
result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements,
operational changes, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company
system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several
years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the Registrants if such costs cannot continue to
be recovered on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced
demand for electricity and natural gas. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing
and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas.
The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation,
regulation, and emission reduction goals.
Concern and activism about climate change continue to increase and, as a result, demand for energy conservation and sustainable
assets could further increase. Additionally, costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be
significant.
The Southern Company system has robust processes for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks, including a
scenario planning process that is used to inform resource planning decisions in the states in which the traditional electric operating
companies operate. This process relies on information from internal and external sources, which may or may not be accurate in
predicting future outcomes. Each year, the Southern Company system develops scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In
2022, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO prices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of
CO emitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon.
Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG
emitting economy. However, the ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of
requirements, natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to
recover costs through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.
Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future carbon constraints, including, but
not limited to, the imposition of a carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and
direct use in homes and businesses. However, such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain
situations, such as new construction. Additionally, efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors may result in higher
electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand. Future GHG constraints, including those related to methane emissions,
designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and
affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas.
Southern Company has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a
long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural
gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon
concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and
carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continuing to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and
making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing research and development with a
particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and
constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to
a net zero future.

OPERATIONAL RISKS
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are
unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, and distributed generation storage technologies and the
successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these matters, including operator
error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other
regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply
interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company
system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and transportation facilities, inability to maintain reliability consistent with
customer expectations as the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power transition their generating fleets in
support of the Southern Company system's net zero goal, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory
cyber security standards, implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events,
such as spills or releases, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods,
tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.
Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters,
cyber intrusions, physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned by
Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and
contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and represented
approximately 22% and 27% of the total KWHs generated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, in the year ended
December 31, 2022. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the
construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational,
and financial risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of
radioactive materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site
storage; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of
licensed lives and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts
and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and
significant capital expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.
Damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage,
including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.
The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear
facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security
measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating
and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial
costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world
could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and
existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the United States, including facilities owned and operated by
third parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.
In addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or
compliance costs.
Transporting and storing natural gas involves risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks,
such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage
to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and underground natural gas
storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, pipelines and
underground natural gas storage facilities are subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with
these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties.
I-17
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Physical attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the Subsidiary Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants face the risk of physical attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation and
storage facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport energy, which could negatively impact their
ability to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities, or, with respect to Southern
Company Gas, its ability to distribute or store natural gas, or otherwise operate its facilities, in the most efficient manner or at all.
These risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. In addition, physical attacks against third-party
providers could have a similar effect on the Southern Company system.
Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized
access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be
physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to
fulfill critical business functions. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of, or inability to remotely access, one or
more key technology systems, networks, or processes could impact the ability of the Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology
systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure
and the technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, denial of service, ransomware,
acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, the Southern Company system faces a heightened risk of
cyberattack. Cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments, have attacked and threatened to attack energy
infrastructure. Various regulators have increasingly stressed that these attacks, including ransomware attacks, and attacks targeting
utility systems and other critical infrastructure, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. Additionally, these risks
may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.
The Registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain
unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business
operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and
disruption of remote access across the Southern Company system, there has been no material impact on business or operations from
these attacks. However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents,
or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will
not have a material adverse effect in the future.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information,
including personally identifiable information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In
some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third-party service providers. Malicious actors may target
these providers to disrupt the services they provide to the Registrants, or to use those third parties to attack the Registrants. The
Registrants' third-party service providers could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures with
respect to their systems.
Internal or external cyber attacks may inhibit the affected Registrant's ability to fulfill critical business functions, including energy
delivery service failures, compromise sensitive and other data, violate privacy laws, and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Any cyber
breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data may also subject the affected Registrant to penalties and
claims from regulators or other third parties. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses. Additionally, the cost
and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing system protection measures are significant, and they
could materially increase to address ever changing intense, complex, and sophisticated cyber risks.
The Southern Company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required
to operate the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern
Company Gas' natural gas customers.
SCS, on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, purchases fuel for the Southern Company
system's generation fleet from a diverse set of suppliers. Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas
through the natural gas distribution utilities. Natural gas is delivered daily from different regions of the country. This daily supply is
complemented by natural gas supplies stored in both company-owned and third party storage locations. To deliver this daily supply
and stored natural gas, the Southern Company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate
pipelines. Disruption in the supply and/or delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays, weather, labor
relations, force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs, and the
ability of Southern Company Gas to serve its natural gas customers.
I-18
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
The Southern Company system is dependent upon natural gas as a fuel source for its power generation needs, which has the
potential to impact, among other things, the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's costs of generation. The
robust growth in supply allowed natural gas prices to moderate and remain below $3 per mmBtu in recent years; however, demand
increases beginning in 2021 and continuing in 2022 resulted in price increases and high volatility. The Henry Hub price averaged
$6.38 per mmBtu in 2022. Current forecasts for 2023 are approximately $3.30. Forward market prices for 2024 and beyond
indicate expectations, absent unforeseen developments, that prices will modestly increase. With the majority of natural gas
production being from shale gas formations, any limitation on shale gas production would be expected to have a material impact on
the supply availability as well as the cost of natural gas. In addition, new demand, in particular exports to Mexico and those from
LNG facilities, has grown significantly and is having greater impact on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern
Power's natural gas markets.
The traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal, and related coal supply contracts, for a portion of their
electric generating capacity. The counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of
financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers and/or railroads may be delayed in supplying or delivering or may not be
required to supply or deliver coal under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric
operating companies are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase additional coal at
higher prices or limit coal generation, and these increased costs may not be recoverable through rates if deemed to be imprudently
incurred. The railroad industry has been experiencing labor shortages, which has led to delays in coal deliveries. As coal-fired
generating facilities are retired, the demand for coal is expected to continue to decline. As a result, railroads may commit fewer
resources to coal transportation, which could increase these risks.
Whereas fuel oil directly provides only a small portion of the Southern Company system's annual generation, its importance to the
reliability of the Southern Company system's generation portfolio continues to grow. Over the last few years, related cost increases
and supply chain challenges have become more common and may increase the risk of reliability challenges.
In addition to fuel supply, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power also need adequate access to water,
which is drawn from nearby sources, to aid in the production of electricity. Any impact to their water resources could also limit the
ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher
fuel and operating costs.
The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on
sales under PPAs, the success of which depend on PPA counterparties performing their obligations, Southern Company
subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the PPAs, and renewal or replacement of the PPAs for the related
generating capacity.
Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs with Southern Power's top three customers
comprising approximately 22% of Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The traditional electric
operating companies have entered into PPAs with non-affiliated parties for the sale of generating capacity.
The revenues related to PPAs are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations. Although the
credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating
companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater
than predicted or specified in the applicable contract.
Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed
at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If one of these Registrants is unable to replace
expiring PPAs with an acceptable new revenue contract, it may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale
prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. The
failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs, including PPAs related to projects under
construction, could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.
Increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in
customer demand for energy could negatively impact Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers
those investments and earns a return for investors through state regulation. Southern Power's business model is primarily focused
on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy counterparties using a bilateral contract model. A key premise
of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive
cost.
Customers and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the Registrants' ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and
varied products, services, and offerings. Additionally, the risk of global climate change continues to shape customers' and
stakeholders' sustainability goals and energy needs.
I-19
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
New technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for
sustainable assets could change the type of assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery. Advances in these technologies
or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technologies or other alternative methods
of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel
efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self-generation by customers. Broader use of
distributed generation by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing
existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature may modify certain
aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology, which may provide for
further competition from these alternative sources of generation.
It is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating
facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the
channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power.
Southern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing
similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia.
If new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be
eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution facilities could be reduced.
Additionally, these technology and customer-induced changes to the electric generation business models could change the risk
profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could be reduced if
Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets.
The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.
The Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging
workforce without appropriate replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or
unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy
time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with major construction projects and ongoing
operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by
decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer at higher rates as compared to prior years and challenges
competing with other employers offering more flexible or fully-remote work options. The Southern Company system's costs,
including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately
obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new
employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability
to manage and operate their businesses.
Supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact operations.
The Southern Company system's operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure equipment, materials,
and other resources. The delivery of components, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to the Southern
Company system's operations has been impacted by ongoing domestic and global supply chain disruptions. International tensions,
including the ramifications of regional conflict, could further exacerbate global supply chain disruptions. These disruptions and
shortages could adversely impact business operations. The constraints in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay
construction, maintenance, or repair of items needed to support normal operations or to continue planned capital investments.
Supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment, and other needed commodities,
and these inflationary increases may continue. While inflation in the United States had been relatively low in recent years, its
impact became more significant during 2021 and continued in 2022. Uncertainty around inflationary impacts continues to increase
in the near-term outlook for economic activity. Rapid inflation or other economic factors may negatively affect the timely recovery
of costs.
The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue.
The effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include new or
extended disruptions to capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and new or prolonged reductions in
economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited to, new or
prolonged reductions in demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or
long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, further increases in costs of necessary equipment, and further
challenges to the development, construction, and/or operation of the Subsidiary Registrants' facilities, including electric
I-20
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
generation, transmission, and distribution assets, the performance of necessary corporate and customer service functions, and
access to funds from financial institutions and capital markets.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities
at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in
Item 8 herein.
CONSTRUCTION RISKS
The Registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities
and may not be able to recover their investments. Also, existing facilities of the Subsidiary Registrants require ongoing
expenditures, including those to meet AROs and other environmental standards and goals.
The businesses of the Registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements,
including transmission, distribution, and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies, generation facilities
for Southern Power, and capital improvements to natural gas distribution facilities for Southern Company Gas. These expenditures
also include those to settle AROs and meet environmental standards and goals. The traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and/or adding environmental and other modifications to
certain existing generating facilities and Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipe in its natural gas distribution system. The
traditional electric operating companies also are in the process of closing ash ponds to comply with the CCR Rule and, where
applicable, state CCR rules. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new
electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems,
and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These projects are long-term in nature and in some
cases may include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously
constructed.
Completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have occurred or
may occur, including labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors;
subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment,
materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; delays due to judicial or regulatory action;
nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training
and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related thereto; design and other licensing-
based compliance matters including, for Plant Vogtle Unit 4, inspections and the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the
ITAAC documentation and the related investigations, reviews, and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization
to load fuel; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or operational
performance; continued challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemic health events; continued public and
policymaker support for projects; environmental and geological conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to
transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a result of project delays.
If a Subsidiary Registrant is unable to complete the development or construction of a project or decides to delay or cancel
construction of a project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that project and may incur substantial cancellation
payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts, as well as other costs associated with the closure and/or
abandonment of the construction project.
In addition, partnership and joint ownership agreements may provide partners or co-owners with certain decision-making authority
in connection with projects under construction, including rights to change ownership allocations and/or cause the cancellation of a
construction project under certain circumstances. Any failure by a partner or co-owner to perform its obligations under the
applicable agreements could have a material negative impact on the applicable project under construction. Southern Power
participates in partnership agreements with respect to a majority of its renewable energy projects and Georgia Power jointly owns
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with other co-owners. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in
Item 8 herein for additional information regarding other jointly-owned facilities.
If construction projects are not completed according to specification, a Registrant may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant
efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income. Furthermore, construction delays associated with renewable projects
could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives.
Even if a construction project (including a joint venture construction project) is completed, the total costs may be higher than
estimated and may not be recoverable through regulated rates, if applicable. In addition, construction delays and contractor
performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern
Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Southern Company and Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of
$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion after tax) through December 31, 2022 to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete
I-21
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear
Construction" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements
under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Alabama Power's
construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.
Once facilities become operational, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant
portions of the traditional electric operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older equipment, even
if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply
with environmental requirements, to provide safe and reliable operations, and/or to meet related retirement obligations.
FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS
The electric generation and energy marketing operations of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
Power and the natural gas operations of Southern Company Gas are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs.
The generation, energy marketing, and natural gas operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in energy
prices and fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power, decrease the amount received from the sale of energy,
and/or make electric generating facilities and natural gas distribution systems less competitive. The market prices for these
commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which
could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Company Gas' regulated gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to
experience underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery
may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including
increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.
The consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the
economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per
customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could
negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.
Outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions
and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the
consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction.
Both federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating
companies and natural gas distribution utilities have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy
efficiency.
Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases
in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.
In addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies
utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can
create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of
changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and
technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.
The operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In
addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary
Registrant.
Electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less
power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
Volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional
electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
I-22
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Power, and the natural gas distribution and underground storage facilities of Southern Company Gas, which is likely to negatively
impact revenue. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern
Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states that could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters,
including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the
operation of certain generating facilities. These volatile weather events may result in unexpected increases in customer load,
requiring procurement of additional power at wholesale prices, or create other grid reliability issues.
In the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any
natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval
of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The traditional electric operating companies from time to time have
experienced and may continue to experience deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances. Additionally, the applicable state
PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency may deny or delay recovery of any portion of such costs.
In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events occurring within a Subsidiary Registrant's service territory or
otherwise affecting its customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for energy for extended periods and may
impact customers' ability to perform under existing PPAs.
Acquisitions, dispositions, or other strategic ventures or investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present
risks, including risks not originally contemplated.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions, dispositions, and investments in the past and may
continue to do so. Such actions cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern Company or its subsidiaries. Southern
Company and its subsidiaries continually seek opportunities to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions or
sales of assets. Specifically, Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various
transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new
generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving
entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Additionally, Southern Company Gas has made significant investments in
existing pipelines, most of which are operated by third parties. If one of these agents fails to perform in a proper manner, the value
of the investment could decline and Southern Company Gas could lose part or all of its investment. In addition, Southern Company
Gas is required to fulfill capital obligations to pipeline joint ventures.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for transactional opportunities and anticipated transactions
may not be completed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the
generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk.
These transactions also involve risks, including that they may not result in an increase in income or provide adequate or expected
funds or return on capital or other anticipated benefits; they may result in Southern Company or its subsidiaries entering into new
or additional lines of business, which may have new or different business or operational risks; they may not be successfully
integrated into the acquiring company's operations, internal control processes, and/or accounting systems; the due diligence
conducted prior to a transaction may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or may not appropriately
evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks; they may result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash
flow; they may involve retained obligations in connection with transitional agreements or deferred payments related to dispositions
that subject Southern Company or its subsidiaries to additional risk; Southern Company or the applicable subsidiary may not be
able to achieve the expected financial benefits from the use of funds generated by any dispositions; expected benefits of a
transaction may be dependent on the cooperation, performance, or credit risk of a counterparty; minority investments in growth
companies may not result in a positive return on investment; or, for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
Company Gas, costs associated with such investments that were expected to be recovered through regulated rates may not be
recoverable.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and Southern Power owns many of its assets
indirectly through subsidiaries. Each of these companies is dependent on cash flows from their respective subsidiaries to
meet their ongoing and future financial obligations.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and, as such, they have no operations of their own.
Substantially all of Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' and many of Southern Power's respective consolidated assets
are held by subsidiaries. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas' and, to a certain extent, Southern Power's ability to meet
their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and, for
Southern Company, to pay dividends on its common stock, is dependent on the net income and cash flows of their respective
subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Southern
Company, Southern Company Gas, or Southern Power, the respective subsidiaries have financial obligations and, with respect to
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, regulatory restrictions that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service.
In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital
I-23
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their
respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay
dividends on Southern Company's common stock.
A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively
affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain
indebtedness.
There are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas
Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other
commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital,
and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial
risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a
negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or
Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable
term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any
downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit
rating downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured
indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.
Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the
optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a
long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and
entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to
accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission
facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many
uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.
Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates
to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely
manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated
with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers' rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of
selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully
execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating
companies may not be able to extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at
prices lower than originally intended.
The traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers
under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At
peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available
generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in
the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in
the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or
construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these
costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed
capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed
price PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs.

The businesses of the Registrants and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital through capital
markets and financial institutions.
The Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity
to meet capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the Registrants or Nicor Gas is
not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited due to
weakened capacity to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash
flows. In addition, the Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on committed credit facilities as back-up liquidity for access to low cost
money markets. Certain market disruptions, including an economic downturn or uncertainty, continued increases in interest rates,
bankruptcy or financial distress at an unrelated utility company, financial institution, or sovereign entity, capital markets volatility
and disruption, either nationally or internationally, changes in tax policy, volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas,
actual or threatened cyber or physical attacks on facilities within the Southern Company system or owned by unrelated utility
companies, future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemic health events, war or threat of war, or the overall health
of the utility and financial institution industries, may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital
through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used
as back-up sources of capital. Furthermore, some financial institutions may be limited in their ability to provide capital to the
Registrants as a result of such financial institution's investment criteria, including criteria related to GHG.
Additionally, since a portion of the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's indebtedness bears interest at variable rates
based on LIBOR, uncertainty related to its announced phase out and alternative reference rates may adversely affect financing
costs. Any replacement benchmark rates may be relatively new, fundamentally different from LIBOR, and/or more volatile than
other benchmark or market rates. SOFR has been identified as the current replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR in the United
States, although the SOFR market is not yet fully developed.
If sources of capital for the Registrants or Nicor Gas are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.
Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern
Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings.
The debt and credit agreements of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various
financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of
default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those
covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.
Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning.
The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of
return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan,
changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern
Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences
between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and
other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement
expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts
of cash. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial
statements in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy
obligations to decommission their nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the
funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
"Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Shareholder activism could cause Southern Company to incur significant expense, hinder execution of Southern Company's
business strategy, and impact Southern Company's stock price.
Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert
management's and Southern Company's board's attention and resources. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to
perceived uncertainties as to Southern Company's future, adversely affect the Southern Company system's relationships with its
employees, customers, regulators, or service providers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also,
Southern Company may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters,
I-25
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
including for third-party advisors. Southern Company's stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be
adversely affected by the events, risks, and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.
The financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, natural disasters, and an
increased focus on climate issues, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of
insurance may decrease, and the insurance that the Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums,
and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount
of loss incurred.
The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in
financial losses that negatively impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their
commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in
limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these
contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures,
which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative
contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in
financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of
these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these
instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in
the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.
See Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Future impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' results of
operations.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount and long-lived assets are tested
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable. At
December 31, 2022, goodwill was $5.2 billion and $5.0 billion for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, respectively.
In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries have long-lived assets recorded on their balance sheets. To the extent the
carrying amount of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, the affected Registrant may be required to incur impairment
charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations. See Notes 1, 7, 9, and 15 to the financial statements in Item
8 herein for information regarding certain impairment charges at Southern Company and Southern Company Gas.

retire or convert to natural gas certain coal-fired generating capacity included in the table above.
Except as discussed below under "Titles to Property," the principal plants and other important units of the traditional electric
operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are owned in fee by the respective companies. It is the opinion of management
of each such company that its operating properties are adequately maintained and are substantially in good operating condition, and
suitable for their intended purpose.
Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC.
The line extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana state line. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, LLC is paying a use fee through 2024
covering all expenses and the amortization of the original cost. At December 31, 2022, the unamortized portion was approximately
$1 million.
Mississippi Power owns a lignite mine that was intended to provide fuel for the Kemper IGCC. Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, the
operator of the mine, has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund
all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was
substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2028. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
In conjunction with Southern Company's 2019 sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and NextEra Energy agreed to negotiate a
mutually acceptable revised operating agreement for Plant Daniel. On July 12, 2022, the co-owners executed a revised operating
agreement. The dispatch procedures in the revised operating agreement for the two jointly-owned coal units at Plant Daniel resulted
in Mississippi Power designating one of the two units as primary and the other as secondary in lieu of each company separately
owning 100% of a single generating unit. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase its co-owner's ownership interest for $1 on
January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. See Notes 2 and 3
under "Mississippi Power – Integrated Resource Plan" and "Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Plant Daniel," respectively, in
Item 8 herein for additional information on Plant Daniel.
In 2022, the maximum demand on the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO was
37,035,000 KWs and occurred on June 15, 2022, which was also the maximum all-time demand. This amount excludes demand
served by capacity retained by MEAG Power, OPC, and SEPA. The reserve margin for the traditional electric operating companies,
Southern Power Company, and SEGCO in 2022 was 20%.
Jointly-Owned Facilities
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power at December 31, 2022 had undivided interests in certain generating plants
and other related facilities with non-affiliated parties. The percentages of ownership of the total plant or facility are as follows:

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power have contracted to operate and maintain the respective units in which each
has an interest (other than Rocky Mountain) as agent for the joint owners. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to
Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear plants.
In addition, Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases totaling $41 million, regarding a portion of a 5%
interest in the original cost of Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement
of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under "Commitments" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are jointly owned by the Vogtle Owners (with each owner currently
holding the same undivided ownership interest as shown in the table above with respect to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See Note 2
to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein.
Titles to Property
The traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important
units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a
leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron
refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on
these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement
obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's undivided
ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts
relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Assets Subject to Lien" and Note 8 to the
financial statements under "Long-term Debt" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating
companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See "Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein and
Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such
as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way,
which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held
under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not
owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental
entities.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable
for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties
that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the
indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Distribution and Transmission Mains
Southern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas.
These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service
lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2022, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned 77,591
miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide
for perpetual use.
Storage Assets
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of
approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet
about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of
storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk
associated with seasonal price movements.
Southern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of
approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage
capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas
distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.

located in California and Texas. The sale of the Texas facility was completed on November 18, 2022 and completion of the sale of
the California facility is expected later in 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 15
to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Jointly-Owned Properties
Southern Company Gas' gas pipeline investments segment has a 50% undivided ownership interest in a 115-mile pipeline facility in
northwest Georgia that was placed in service in 2017. Southern Company Gas also has an agreement to lease its 50% undivided
ownership in the pipeline facility. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Business Activities
Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies,
Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the
Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the
distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the
traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale
of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements
for additional information.
•The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically
integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale
customers in the Southeast.
•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy
projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks
opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and
sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily
with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as
commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new
generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.
•Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas.
Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee –
and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through
three reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services, which
includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-
reportable segment, all other. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments
also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying
microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications.
Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue
acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
Recent Developments
Alabama Power
On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved the following items:
•Alabama Power's petition for a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition
of the Calhoun Generating Station. The transaction closed on September 30, 2022 and the related costs are being recovered
through Rate CNP New Plant, which reflected an increase in annual revenues of $34 million, or 0.6%, effective with November
2022 billings.
•An increase to Rate ECR effective with August 2022 billings, which resulted in an increase of approximately $310 million
annually. The approved changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but do
impact the related operating cash flows.
•Modifications to Rate NDR.
•An accounting order authorizing Alabama Power to create a reliability reserve separate from the NDR and transition the
previous Rate NDR authority related to reliability expenditures to the reliability reserve. Alabama Power may make accruals to
the reliability reserve if the NDR balance exceeds $35 million. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power accrued $166 million to
the reserve.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
On September 23, 2022, the FERC authorized Alabama Power to use updated depreciation rates from its 2021 depreciation study
effective January 2023. The updated depreciation rates are expected to result in an approximately $500 million increase in annual
depreciation expense.
On November 1, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR of approximately $500 million annually effective with
December 2022 billings. The approved changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income,
but do impact operating cash flows related to fuel cost recovery.
On December 1, 2022, Alabama Power submitted calculations for Rate CNP Compliance for 2023 which resulted in an annual
revenue increase of approximately $255 million, or 3.7%, effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated
depreciation rates.
On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in
depreciation resulting from updates to certain depreciation rates. Rate CNP Depreciation will result in an annual revenue increase
of approximately $318 million, or 4.6%, effective with January 2023 billings. In addition, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama
Power to accelerate the amortization of a regulatory liability associated with excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes,
which is being returned to customers through bill credits of up to approximately $318 million in 2023 to offset the impact of the
Rate CNP Depreciation increase. The Alabama PSC will determine the treatment of any remaining excess federal accumulated
deferred income taxes at a future date. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
During 2022, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, which is expected to be placed in service in November
2023. At December 31, 2022, associated project expenditures totaled approximately $518 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama
Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $62 million. On February 7, 2023, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to
issue the 2022 refund to customers through bill credits in August 2023.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
Georgia Power
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status
Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in
which Georgia Power currently holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to
complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024,
respectively, is $10.6 billion.
On July 29, 2022, Southern Nuclear announced that all Unit 3 ITAACs had been submitted to the NRC. On August 3, 2022, the
NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the combined license for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed
nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. Fuel load for Unit 3 was completed on October 17, 2022. In early 2023,
during the start-up and pre-operational testing for Unit 3, Southern Nuclear identified and is remediating certain equipment and
component issues. As a result, Unit 3 is projected to be placed in service during May or June 2023. The projected schedule for Unit
3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by
further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. After considering the timeframe and duration of hot functional
and other testing and recent experience with Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing, Unit 4 is now projected to be placed in
service during late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential
impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction
productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft
laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases.
During 2022, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $307 million were assigned to the base capital cost
forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, additional
craft and support resources, procurement for Units 3 and 4, and the equipment and component issues identified during Unit 3 start-
up and pre-operational testing. During 2022, Georgia Power also increased its total project capital cost forecast by $125 million to
replenish construction contingency and $9 million for construction monitoring costs, which were approved for recovery by the
Georgia PSC in its nineteenth VCM order. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future
recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by
management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to
income in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of $36 million ($27 million after tax), $32
million ($24 million after tax), and $148 million ($110 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital
cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described in Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters."
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases
subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under
Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts"). The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they
believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions.
On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their
tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises. On June 18, 2022, OPC and MEAG Power each
filed a separate lawsuit against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia seeking a declaratory judgment that
the starting dollar amount is $17.1 billion and that the cost-sharing and tender provisions have been triggered. On July 25, 2022 and
July 28, 2022, Georgia Power filed its answers in the lawsuits filed by MEAG Power and OPC, respectively, and included
counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and that costs related to force
majeure events are excluded prior to calculating the cost-sharing and tender provisions and when calculating Georgia Power's
related financial obligations. On September 26, 2022, Dalton filed complaints in each of these lawsuits.
On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper
interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other
items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4;
(ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are
incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately $92 million based on the
current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20% of MEAG Power's costs of construction with
respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. On October
4, 2022, MEAG Power and Georgia Power filed a notice of settlement and voluntary dismissal of the pending litigation described
above, including Georgia Power's counterclaim, and, on October 6, 2022, Dalton dismissed its related complaint. Georgia Power
recorded pre-tax charges (credits) to income in the fourth quarter 2021, the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the
fourth quarter 2022 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax), $16 million ($12 million after tax), $(102) million
($(76) million after tax), and $53 million ($40 million after tax), respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender
provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of $407 million associated with these
provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with
MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, described above.
Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $345 million associated with the
cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments for OPC and Dalton based on the current project capital cost
forecast.
Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in
the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees
with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia
Power to pay 100% of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia
Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are
placed in service.
The ultimate impact of these matters on the construction schedule and project capital cost forecast and related cost recovery for
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
2022 ARP
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2022 ARP, including estimated net rate increases totaling
$216 million, $377 million, and $403 million effective January 1, 2023, January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, respectively. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2022 ARP" for additional information.
Integrated Resource Plans
On July 21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial IRP (2022 IRP), as modified by a stipulated agreement
among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. In the
2022 IRP decision, the Georgia PSC approved several requests, including the following:
•Decertification and retirement of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), which occurred on
August 31, 2022, and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) by December 31, 2028, as well as the

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
reclassification to regulatory asset accounts of the remaining net book values of these units and any remaining unusable
materials and supplies inventories upon retirement.
•Decertification and retirement of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) by
December 31, 2028. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "SEGCO" for additional information.
•Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy, including approval of Georgia Power's plans to address CCR at its ash
ponds and landfills.
The Georgia PSC deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) to
the 2025 IRP.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information.
Mississippi Power
On June 7, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing for 2022, resulting in an annual
increase in revenues of approximately $18 million, or 1.9%, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2022.
On August 26, 2022, the FERC accepted an amended shared service agreement (SSA) between Mississippi Power and Cooperative
Energy, effective July 1, 2022, under which Cooperative Energy will continue to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation
services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually through 2035. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power is serving
approximately 400 MWs of Cooperative Energy's annual demand. Beginning in 2036, Cooperative Energy will provide 100% of its
electricity requirements at the MRA delivery points under the tariff. Neither party has the option to cancel the amended SSA.
Mississippi Power expects to remarket this capacity, including the potential development of future arrangements with Cooperative
Energy.
On July 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for a $23 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues
under the MRA tariff. Cooperative Energy filed a complaint with the FERC challenging the new rates. On September 13, 2022, the
FERC issued an order that accepted Mississippi Power's request effective September 14, 2022, subject to refund, and established
hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On November 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to increase retail fuel revenues by $25 million
annually effective with the first billing cycle of February 2023 and an additional $25 million annually effective with the first billing
cycle of June 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Mississippi PSC voted to defer approval of the filing. Mississippi Power is allowed to
maintain current billing rates and continue accruing its weighted-average cost of capital on any under or over fuel recovery balance.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to create a reliability
reserve for the purpose of deferring generation, transmission, and distribution reliability-related expenditures for use in a future
year, under certain conditions. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power accrued $25 million to the reliability reserve.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information.
Southern Power
During 2022, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the remaining 40 MWs of the Tranquillity battery
energy storage facility (72 MWs total) and the remaining 15 MWs of the Garland battery energy storage facility (88 MWs total).
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners,
based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-
service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with
facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at
December 31, 2022 was 96% through 2027 and 90% through 2032, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately
12 years.
See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
Southern Company Gas
On August 1, 2022, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual
base rate revenues of $69 million, including $15 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily
to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure, technology, and workforce development. The requested
increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2023, a ROE of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
53.2%. Rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2023, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to rule on the
requested increase in the third quarter 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On September 7, 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities
located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments.
The sale of the Texas facility was completed on November 18, 2022 and completion of the sale of the California facility is expected
later in 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax
impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2022 related to the facilities.
See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate
increase of $53 million effective January 1, 2023.
On January 3, 2023, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $321 million increase in
annual base rate revenues, including $59 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program
through December 31, 2023. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending December 31,
2024, a return on equity of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.5%. Further, Nicor Gas is seeking to recover an additional $32 million
under three proposed riders related to recovery of vehicle fuel costs, company use gas, and customer payment fees. The Illinois
Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments
will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Key Performance Indicators
In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.8 million electric and
gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on
several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric
and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary
Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – "Southern
Company Gas – Operating Metrics" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating
Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.
The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer
satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices.
The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top
quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" and "Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan" for additional
information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms
that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.
Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced
outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to
customers.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Southern Company
Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $3.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 47.3%, from
2021. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4, increases in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing, warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter
2022, and sales growth, and increases in natural gas revenues from base rate increases and continued infrastructure replacement,
partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs and higher interest expense. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Basic EPS was $3.28 in 2022 and $2.26 in 2021. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based
compensation, was $3.26 in 2022 and $2.24 in 2021. EPS for 2022 and 2021 was negatively impacted by $0.04 and $0.01 per
share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under
"Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Southern Company" for additional information.
Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.70 in 2022 and $2.62 in 2021. In January 2023, Southern Company declared a
quarterly dividend of 68 cents per share. For 2022, the dividend payout ratio was 82% compared to 116% for 2021.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Electric Operating Revenues
Electric operating revenues for 2022 were $22.9 billion, reflecting a $4.6 billion, or 25.0%, increase from 2021. Details of electric
operating revenues were as follows:
 2022 2021
 (in millions)
Retail electric — prior year $ 14,852 
Estimated change resulting from —
Rates and pricing 451 
Sales growth 165 
Weather 244 
Fuel and other cost recovery 2,485 
Retail electric — current year $ 18,197 $ 14,852 
Wholesale electric revenues 3,641 2,455 
Other electric revenues 747 718 
Other revenues 288 275 
Electric operating revenues $ 22,873 $ 18,300 
Retail electric revenues increased $3.3 billion, or 22.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change
are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2022 was primarily due to increases at Georgia Power
resulting from higher contributions by commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff
increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing effects associated with customer usage. In addition, Alabama Power made a
larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021. These increases were partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia
Power's retail ROE exceeding the allowed retail ROE range in 2022.
Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs,
including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses,
including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have
one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new
plants, and PPA capacity costs.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" for additional information. Also see "Energy
Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and
weather.
Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:
2022 2021
 (in millions)
Capacity and other $ 625 $ 550 
Energy 3,016 1,905
Total $ 3,641 $ 2,455 
In 2022, wholesale electric revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 48.3%, as compared to 2021 due to increases of $1.1 billion in
energy revenues and $75 million in capacity revenues. Energy revenues increased $744 million at Southern Power primarily due to
fuel and purchased power increases compared to 2021 and an increase in the volume of KWHs sold primarily associated with
natural gas PPAs. Energy revenues increased $367 million at the traditional electric operating companies primarily due to higher
natural gas and coal prices. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a net increase in natural gas PPAs at Southern
Power and increased opportunity sales at Alabama Power due to warmer weather.
Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from
PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the
greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy
revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's
generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern
Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are
II-9
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar
and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility
through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable
operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted
by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at
Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term
opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable
cost to produce the energy.
Other Electric Revenues
Other electric revenues increased $29 million, or 4.0%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases
of $54 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, $18 million in outdoor
lighting sales at Georgia Power, $13 million in cogeneration steam revenues associated with higher natural gas prices at Alabama
Power, and $11 million in rent revenues at the traditional electric operating companies, partially offset by a decrease of $32 million
resulting from the termination of a transmission service contract, an increase of $18 million in realized losses associated with price
stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs, and a decrease of $17 million from retail solar
programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to customers, all at Georgia Power.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and
the percent change from 2021 were as follows:
2022
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted
Percent Change
(in billions)
Residential 49.6 4.8 % 0.2 %
Commercial 48.3 3.5 2.0 
Industrial 49.5 1.5 1.5 
Other 0.6 (4.8) (4.8)
Total retail 148.0 3.2 1.2 %
Wholesale 56.3 12.6 
Total energy sales 204.3 5.6 %
(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the
estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service
territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of
weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy sales increased 1.8 billion KWHs in 2022 as compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted
residential KWH sales and weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.2% and 2.0%, respectively, in 2022 when
compared to 2021 largely due to customer growth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer
usage decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021 as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity outside the home.
Industrial KWH sales increased 1.5% in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in the pipeline and paper sectors,
partially offset by a decrease in the chemicals sector.
See "Electric Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price
and KWH sales.
Other Revenues
Other revenues increased $13 million, or 4.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $10
million in unregulated lighting sales at Alabama Power and $7 million associated with energy conservation projects at Georgia
Power.(*)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale
market.
Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows:
2022 2021
Total generation (in billions of KWHs) 186 179 
Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs) 25 18

Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) 4.05 2.55 
Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH) 7.66 5.85 
(a)Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser
under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $8.4 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 69.0%, as compared to 2021. The
increase was primarily the result of a $2.8 billion increase in the average cost of fuel generated and purchased and a $653 million
increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues
and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses
incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net
income.
Fuel
In 2022, fuel expense was $6.8 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 70.4%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due
to a 72.3% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 28.8% increase in the average cost of coal per KWH
generated, an 11.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, and a 9.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated
by natural gas.
Purchased Power
In 2022, purchased power expense was $1.6 billion, an increase of $615 million, or 62.9%, as compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily due to a 38.2% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased and a 30.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased
primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices.
Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the
market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $459 million, or 9.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily associated with increases of $247 million in transmission and distribution expenses, $95 million in generation expenses
primarily related to scheduled outage and maintenance costs, $25 million for a reliability reserve accrual in 2022 at Mississippi(a)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Power, and $22 million in amortization of cloud software. The transmission and distribution increase was primarily due to
increased line maintenance, as well as the net impact of Alabama Power accruals of $166 million to the reliability reserve in 2022
and an incremental $65 million to the NDR in 2021. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Storm Damage and Reliability
Reserves" for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $76 million, or 2.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to
additional plant in service.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $63 million, or 5.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily reflects an
increase in municipal franchise fees associated with higher retail revenues at Georgia Power.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling $183
million and $1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect Georgia
Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to
the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
Gain on dispositions, net decreased $20 million, or 33.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a net decrease of $39
million in gains at Southern Power related to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in
2021, partially offset by $17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets at Georgia Power in 2022. See
Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $31 million, or 17.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase
was primarily associated with an increase in capital expenditures related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction at Alabama Power and
an increase in capital expenditures subject to AFUDC at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama
Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $99 million, or 10.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects
approximately $54 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $43 million related to higher interest rates. See
Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $89 million, or 20.8%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a $68 million increase
in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and a $23 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $33
million increase in charitable donations at the traditional electric operating companies. See Note 11 to the financial statements for
additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $629 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings
largely resulting from a decrease in charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a
valuation allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional
information.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Substantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling
interests increased $8 million, or 8.1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increased loss was primarily due to $28 million in higher
HLBV loss allocations to Southern Power's tax equity partners in 2022, largely offset by $23 million in loss allocations associated
with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes 9 and 15 to the
financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Gas Business
Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary
businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services (until the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021), and gas marketing
services.
A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows:

Other income (expense), net 53 106 
Income taxes 180 (95)
Net income $ 572 $ 33 
Seasonality of Results
During the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating
Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods
of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services' operating revenues were occasionally impacted due to peak
usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding
cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year.
Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2022, the percentage of
operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through
December) were 67% and 66%, respectively. For 2021, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the
Heating Season were 70% and 102%, respectively.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues in 2022 were $6.0 billion, reflecting a $1.6 billion, or 36.1%, increase compared to 2021. Details of operating
revenues were as follows:
2022
(in millions)
Operating revenues – prior year $ 4,380 
Estimated change resulting from –
Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes 252 
Gas costs and other cost recovery 1,468 
Gas marketing services 15 
Wholesale gas services (187)
Other 34 
Operating revenues – current year $ 5,962 
Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to rate increases at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas
Light, and Chattanooga Gas and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas
cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution
utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption
changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs
recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income
from the natural gas distribution utilities. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
The change in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services was due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021. See Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in
Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities rates include
provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues
generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Natural Gas Cost Recovery" for additional information.
Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 87.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2022.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost
of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market
value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Cost of natural gas was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 85.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost
recovery in 2022 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 73.0% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $104 million, or 9.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Excluding $66 million of
expenses related to Sequent in 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately $174 million. The
increase was primarily due to increases of $64 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $43 million in expenses passed
through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at the natural gas distribution utilities, $31 million primarily related to
bad debt, customer service, and sales expenses, and $18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 4.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to
continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $57 million, or 25.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $39
million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an $11 million increase in invested capital
tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.
Impairment Charges
In 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax)
as a result of an agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. See Note 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
Earnings from equity method investments increased $98 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-
tax impairment charges totaling $84 million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting
from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas"
for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $25 million, or 10.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflects
approximately $16 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $8 million related to higher interest rates. See
Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $106 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable
contributions by Sequent prior to its sale totaling $101 million in 2021 and an increase of $10 million primarily related to non-
service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes decreased $95 million, or 34.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit
of $110 million resulting from the sale of Sequent in 2021 and $32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to
sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially offset by $17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from
the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Business Activities
Southern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to
business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial,
industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which
provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public
and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.

Cost of other sales for these other business activities increased $19 million, or 7.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to
distributed infrastructure projects at PowerSecure.
Impairment Charges
In 2022, a goodwill impairment charge of $119 million was recorded at PowerSecure. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2022, a $14 million gain was recorded at the parent company as a result of the early termination of the transition services
agreement related to the 2019 sale of Gulf Power.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
Earnings from equity method investments for these other business activities decreased $23 million, or 88.5%, in 2022 as compared
to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in investment income at Southern Holdings.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for these other business activities increased $61 million, or 9.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase
primarily results from parent company financing activities and includes approximately $52 million related to higher average
outstanding borrowings, $15 million related to fair value hedge amortization, $11 million related to higher interest rates, and $7
million in fees associated with remarketing the 2019 Series A Equity Units (Equity Units), partially offset by a $23 million loss in
2021 associated with the extinguishment of debt. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net for these other business activities decreased $149 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due
to a $93 million pre-tax gain ($99 million gain after tax) recorded at Southern Holdings in 2021 related to the termination of two
leveraged leases and a $24 million decrease in leveraged lease income as a result of the terminations. See Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company" for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Alabama Power
Alabama Power's 2022 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $1.34 billion, representing a $102 million, or 8.2%,
increase from 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with a larger Rate RSE customer
refund in 2021, warmer weather in Alabama Power's service territory in 2022 compared to 2021, and sales growth. Also
contributing to the increase in net income were increases in other operating revenues associated with transmission revenues and
unregulated lighting sales, as well as an increase in AFUDC, partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs
associated with a reliability reserve accrual and higher interest expense.
A condensed income statement for Alabama Power follows:

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Retail revenues increased $971 million, or 17.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are
shown in the preceding table. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fuel and other cost recovery, as well as an increase in
revenue driven by a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021, warmer weather in 2022 compared to 2021, and sales growth in all
major retail classes.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate ECR," " – Rate RSE," and " – Rate CNP Compliance" for
additional information. See "Energy Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes
related to sales growth and weather.
Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama
PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and
other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for
additional information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:
2022 2021
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 213 $ 173 
Energy 513 204 
Total non-affiliated $ 726 $ 377 
In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $349 million, or 92.6%, as compared to 2021 due to a $309
million increase in energy revenues primarily related to higher natural gas prices and a $40 million increase in capacity revenues
primarily related to increased opportunity sales due to warmer weather in 2022 as compared to 2021.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared
to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company
system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in
energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net
income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales
are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.
In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $31 million, or 18.1%, as compared to 2021. The revenue increase
reflects a 64.7% increase in the price of energy due to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a 28.1% decrease in KWH sales
due to the availability of lower cost Southern Company system resources compared to Alabama Power's generation.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy
purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.
In 2022, other operating revenues increased $53 million, or 14.5%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $19 million
in transmission revenues primarily due to open access transmission tariff sales, $13 million in cogeneration steam revenue
associated with higher natural gas prices, $10 million in unregulated lighting sales, and $9 million in rent revenues.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and
the percent change from 2021 were as follows:
2022
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted
Percent Change(*)
(in billions)
Residential 18.4 5.4 % 0.1 %
Commercial 13.1 2.6 0.1 
Industrial 20.9 0.5 0.5 
Other 0.1 (10.1) (10.1)

Wholesale
Non-affiliates 12.7 29.1 
Affiliates 3.7 (28.1)
Total wholesale 16.4 9.3 
Total energy sales 68.9 4.2 %
(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the
estimated effect of deviations from the normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Alabama Power's
service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence
of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. In 2022, weather-adjusted
residential and commercial KWH sales were flat compared to 2021. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.5% as a result of an increase
in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the forest product and pipeline sectors.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and
wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the
availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

(a)Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser
under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the
provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 64.8%, compared to 2021. The
increase was primarily due to a $648 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $390 million increase
related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC,
continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2
to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate ECR" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense was $1.8 billion in 2022, an increase of $605 million, or 49.0%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to
a 77.2% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 22.4% increase in the
average cost of coal per KWH generated, a 24.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, and a 9.7% decrease
in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 13.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear as a
result of the extension of a planned outage.
Purchased Power – Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $441 million in 2022, an increase of $220 million, or 99.5%, compared to 2021.
The increase was primarily due to a 90.8% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand
in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 10.3% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the
Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and
the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power – Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $360 million in 2022, an increase of $213 million, or 144.9%, compared to 2021. The
increase was primarily due to a 58.3% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand in
2022 compared to 2021 and a 54.4% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices.(a)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual
agreements, as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $200 million, or 11.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $147 million in transmission and distribution expenses primarily associated with a $166 million
reliability reserve accrual in 2022, partially offset by an incremental $65 million NDR accrual in 2021, as well as other line
maintenance, $33 million in generation expenses primarily associated with maintenance and Rate CNP Compliance-related
expenses, and $17 million in customer accounts, customer service, and sales expenses primarily associated with labor and bad debt
expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Reliability Reserve Accounting Order" and " – Rate CNP
Compliance" for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $16 million, or 1.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of $28
million in depreciation related to an increase in additional plant in service, largely offset by a decrease of $16 million in
amortization of regulatory assets associated with the retirement of certain generating plants.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $18 million, or 34.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due
to an increase in capital expenditures related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction, as well as an increase in capital expenditures
related to hydro production. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and
Necessity" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $42 million, or 12.4%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects
approximately $36 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $12 million related to higher interest rates. See
Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $37 million, or 34.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in interest
income and non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $51 million, or 13.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and a decrease
in state tax credits. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's 2022 net income was $1.8 billion, representing a $1.2 billion, or 210.4%, increase from the previous year. The
increase was primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as
well as an increase in retail revenues associated with rates and pricing, warmer weather in Georgia Power's service territory
compared to 2021, and sales growth. These increases were partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information on the construction of
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Operating revenues for 2022 were $11.6 billion, reflecting a $2.3 billion, or 25.1%, increase from 2021. Details of operating
revenues were as follows:
2022 2021
(in millions)

Wholesale revenues 235 197 
Other operating revenues 557 585 
Total operating revenues $ 11,584 $ 9,260 
Retail revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 27.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are
shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to higher contributions from commercial and
industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing
effects associated with customer usage, partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding
the allowed retail ROE range in 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP" for
additional information.
See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales growth in
2022.
Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power
costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Wholesale revenues from power sales were as follows:
2022 2021
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 48 $ 63 
Energy 187 134 
Total $ 235 $ 197 
In 2022, wholesale revenues increased $38 million, or 19.3%, as compared to 2021 largely due to an increase of $78 million related
to the average cost of fuel primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in KWH
sales associated with lower market demand and a $10 million decrease in capacity revenues due to the expiration of a non-affiliate
PPA in 2021.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs
have both capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the
contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates
will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the
Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and
the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel
prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term
opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions
do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.
In 2022, other operating revenues decreased $28 million, or 4.8%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease of $32 million
resulting from the termination of a transmission service contract, an increase of $18 million in realized losses associated with price
stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs, and decreases of $17 million from retail solar
programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to customers and $16 million from power delivery construction and maintenance
contracts. These reductions were largely offset by increases of $27 million associated with unregulated outdoor lighting sales and
energy conservation projects, $20 million in open access transmission tariff sales, and $4 million from maintenance services
provided to integrated transmission system owners.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and
the percent change from 2021 were as follows:
2022
Total
KWHsTotal KWH

Other 0.4 (3.0) (2.9)
Total retail 86.0 3.6 1.9 %
Wholesale 2.4 (23.0)
Total energy sales 88.4 2.6 %
(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the
estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Georgia Power's service
territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of
weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential and
commercial KWH sales increased 0.4% and 2.9%, respectively, in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily due to customer(*)

growth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer usage decreased in 2022 when compared to
2021 as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity outside the home. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased
2.4% primarily due to increases in the pipeline, lumber, paper, and electronic sectors, partially offset by decreases in the textiles and
chemicals sectors.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated
companies.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
Fuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is
determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia
Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.
Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:
2022 2021
Total generation (in billions of KWHs) 59.7 58.1 
Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs) 33.6 31.7 
Sources of generation (percent) —

Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) 3.64 2.39 
Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH) 7.88 5.07 
(*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 61.3%, compared to 2021. The
increase was due to an increase of $1.7 billion related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an increase of $148
million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally
offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense was $2.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 71.6%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to
increases of 65.9% and 37.8% in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas and coal, respectively, and a 10.8% increase
in the volume of KWHs generated by coal.
Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $856 million in 2022, an increase of $224 million, or 35.4%, compared to 2021.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of 26.5% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas
and coal prices and an increase of 25.4% in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily due to higher demand.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the
Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and
the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.(*)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Purchased Power - Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $1.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $542 million, or 63.1%, compared to 2021. The
increase was primarily due to an increase of 75.3% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and
coal prices.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual
agreements, all as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $136 million, or 6.1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $96 million in distribution expenses primarily associated with line maintenance, $45 million in certain
compensation and benefit expenses, $11 million in amortization of cloud software, and $9 million in maintenance costs at corporate
and field support facilities, partially offset by $17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets, a decrease of
$15 million in generation expenses primarily related to scheduled generation outages partially offset by environmental projects, and
a $12 million reduction in billing adjustments with integrated transmission system owners largely resulting from a terminated
transmission service agreement.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $59 million, or 4.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $46
million associated with additional plant in service and $12 million associated with amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR
AROs under the terms of the 2019 ARP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans"
and " – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $51 million, or 10.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in
municipal franchise fees resulting from higher retail revenues.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling $183
million and $1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect revisions to the
total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $13 million, or 10.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due
to an increase in capital expenditures subject to AFUDC.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $64 million, or 15.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily
reflects approximately $39 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $24 million related to higher interest rates.
See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 8 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $34 million, or 23.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in non-
service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on Georgia
Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
In 2022, income tax expense was $370 million compared to income tax benefit of $168 million for 2021, a change of $538 million.
The change was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings largely resulting from a decrease in charges associated with the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a valuation allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax
credit carryforwards. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" and Note 10 to the
financial statements for additional information.

expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi
Power's service territory. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional
information.
Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based
sales, were as follows:
2022 2021
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 3 $ 3 
Energy 249 227 
Total non-affiliated $ 252 $ 230 
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $22 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due
to higher fuel costs and an increase in base revenue from MRA customers primarily due to increased demand as a result of weather
impacts in 2022.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared
to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern
Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and
decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have
a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric
cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which
are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi Power's
total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual
relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are
also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a
margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 under "Mississippi Power – Municipal and Rural
Associations Tariff" for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $272 million, or 144.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $243 million associated with higher fuel costs, primarily for natural gas, and $29 million associated
with higher KWH sales due to lower cost available Mississippi Power resources as compared to the available affiliate company
generation.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.
In 2022, other operating revenues increased $18 million, or 62.1%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $13 million
in unregulated sales associated with power delivery construction and maintenance projects and $4 million in open access
transmission tariff revenues.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" and Note 1 to the financial statements under "Fuel Costs" for additional information.
Fuel expense increased $276 million, or 58.8%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 52.3% increase in the average cost of
natural gas per KWH generated, a 29.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 27.5% increase in the average cost
of coal per KWHs generated, and a 3.9% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.
Purchased power expense increased $16 million, or 62.0%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 77.2% increase in the
average cost per KWH purchased, partially offset by an 8.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased.
Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company
system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as
approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $63 million, or 20.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily due to a $25 million reliability reserve accrual in 2022 and increases of $12 million related to unregulated power delivery
construction and maintenance projects, $7 million associated with storm reserve accruals, $6 million in employee compensation
and benefits, $4 million in transmission and distribution line maintenance, and $4 million associated with the Kemper County
energy facility primarily related to sales and use taxes. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – System
Restoration Rider" and " – Reliability Reserve Accounting Order" and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters –
Mississippi Power" for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $16 million, or 76.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of $11 million in the
flowback of excess deferred income taxes associated with new PEP rates that became effective in April 2022, as well as an increase
of $5 million due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Performance

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Southern Power
Net income attributable to Southern Power for 2022 was $354 million, an $88 million increase from 2021. The increase was
primarily due to higher revenues driven by higher market prices of energy and new natural gas PPAs and higher income associated
with tax equity partnerships, partially offset by higher other operations and maintenance expenses, gains from contributions of wind
turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021, and a tax benefit due to a change in state apportionment
methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in 2021.

Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural
gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not
contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of
the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.
Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue
Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed
costs plus a return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the
energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy
compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start
charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are generally
accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.
Solar and Wind Energy Revenue
Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have
capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a
fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to
recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these
facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

Total operating revenues $ 3,369 $ 2,216 
Operating revenues for 2022 were $3.4 billion, a $1.2 billion, or 52.0% increase from 2021. The increase in operating revenues was
primarily due to the following:
•PPA capacity revenues increased $43 million, or 10.5%, primarily due to a net increase in MW capacity under contract from
natural gas PPAs and an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs.
•PPA energy revenues increased $810 million, or 61.8%, primarily due to a $656 million increase in sales under existing natural
gas PPAs resulting from a $539 million increase in the price of fuel and purchased power and a $117 million increase in the
volume of KWHs sold. Also contributing to the increase was a $164 million increase in sales associated with new natural gas
PPAs, net of contractual expirations.
•Non-PPA revenues increased $294 million, or 63.0%, due to a $338 million increase in the market price of energy, partially
offset by a $42 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales.

Total generation and purchased power 51 8.5% 47
Total generation and purchased power (excluding solar , wind, fuel cells, and tolling agreements) 31 10.7% 28
Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel
(tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under
such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues
and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are
not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power
pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.
Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the
Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on
an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate
company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Details of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows:
2022 2021
(in millions)
Fuel $ 1,614 $ 802 
Purchased power 311 139 
Total fuel and purchased power expenses $ 1,925 $ 941 
In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $984 million, or 104.6%, compared to 2021. Fuel expense increased
$812 million, or 101.2%, primarily due to a $719 million increase associated with the average cost of fuel and a $93 million
increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated. Purchased power expense increased $172 million, or 123.7%, largely due
to a $168 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2022, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $59 million, or 14.0%, compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $42 million related to generation maintenance and outage expenses and $10 million in transmission
expenses to serve new natural gas PPAs, partially offset by $6 million related to the allocation in 2021 of uncollected settlements by
the Energy Reliability Council of Texas market as a result of Winter Storm Uri.
Loss on Sales-Type Leases
In 2021, a $40 million loss on sales-type leases was recorded upon commencement of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy
storage facilities' PPAs, $26 million of which was allocated through noncontrolling interests to Southern Power's partners in the
projects. The loss was due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners. See Notes 9 and 15 to
the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2022, gain on dispositions, net decreased $39 million, or 95.1%, compared to 2021 primarily due to contributions of wind
turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Power" for additional information.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
In 2022, income tax expense was $20 million compared to income tax benefit of $13 million for 2021, a change of $33 million. The
change was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2022 and a change in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax
legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in the first quarter 2021, partially offset by higher wind PTCs in 2022. See Notes 1 and
10 to the financial statements under "Income Taxes" and "Effective Tax Rate," respectively, for additional information.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
In 2022, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $8 million, or 8.1%, compared to 2021. The increased loss was
primarily due to $28 million in higher HLBV loss allocations to tax equity partners in 2022, largely offset by $23 million in loss
allocations associated with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes
9 and 15 to the financial statements under "Lessor" and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
Southern Company Gas
Operating Metrics
Southern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and
volumes of natural gas sold.
Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating
Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has
various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its
exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also
utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.
The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices,
economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are
primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects
of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural
gas volumes sold to its customers.
Seasonality of Results
During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the
gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021,
wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to
summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and
certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of
certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable.
However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas'
operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.

Net Income
Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2022 was $572 million, an increase of $33 million, or 6.1%, compared to
2021. Net income increased $88 million at gas pipeline investments primarily as a result of a 2021 impairment charge related to the
PennEast Pipeline project and $58 million at gas distribution operations primarily due to base rate increases and continued
investment in infrastructure replacement, largely offset by after-tax impairment charges in 2022 totaling $99 million related to the
sale of natural gas storage facilities. The 2021 results also included $107 million of net income from Sequent, including a $92
million after-tax gain and $85 million of additional tax expense resulting from its July 1, 2021 sale. See Notes 7 and 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

Operating Revenues
Operating revenues in 2022 were $6.0 billion, reflecting a $1.6 billion, or 36.1%, increase compared to 2021. Details of operating
revenues were as follows:
2022
(in millions)

Gas costs and other cost recovery 1,468 
Gas marketing services 15 
Wholesale gas services (187)
Other 34 
Operating revenues – current year $ 5,962 
Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2022 due to rate increases at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, and
Chattanooga Gas and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2022 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a
result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather
or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas
distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through
natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution
operations. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
The changes in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services were due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021. See Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Heating Degree Days
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that limit their exposure to weather
changes. Southern Company Gas also uses hedges for the majority of any remaining exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in
Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services; therefore, weather typically does not
have a significant net income impact. The following table presents Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the
primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.

Customer Count
The following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2022 and 2021:
2022 2021
(in thousands, except market share %)
Gas distribution operations 4,358 4,337 
Gas marketing services
Energy customers 622 603 
Market share of energy customers in Georgia 29.3 % 28.7 %
(*)Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.
Southern Company Gas anticipates customer growth and uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers
and to retain existing customers.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, natural gas distribution rates include provisions
to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal
the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Natural Gas Cost Recovery" for additional information. Cost of natural gas at
gas distribution operations represented 87.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2022.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost
of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market
value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
In 2022, cost of natural gas was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 85.5%, compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost
recovery in 2022 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 73.0% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021.

expenses related to Sequent in 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately $174 million. The
increase was primarily due to increases of $64 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $43 million in expenses passed
through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at gas distribution operations, $31 million primarily related to bad debt,
customer service, and sales expenses, and $18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.(*)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Depreciation and Amortization
In 2022, depreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 4.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to
continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
In 2022, taxes other than income taxes increased $57 million, or 25.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a
$39 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an $11 million increase in invested
capital tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net
income.
Impairment Charges
In 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax)
as a result of an agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Gain on Dispositions, Net
In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. See Note 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
In 2022, earnings from equity method investments increased $98 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-
tax impairment charges totaling $84 million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting
from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas"
for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
In 2022, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $25 million, or 10.5%, compared to 2021. The increase reflects
approximately $16 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $8 million related to higher interest rates. See
Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
In 2022, other income (expense), net increased $106 million compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable
contributions by Sequent prior to its sale totaling $101 million in 2021 and an increase of $10 million at gas distribution operations
primarily related to non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Income Taxes
In 2022, income taxes decreased $95 million, or 34.5%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit
of $110 million resulting from the sale of Sequent in 2021 and $32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to
sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially offset by $17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from
the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.

Gas Distribution Operations
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight
by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern
Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed
and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a
reasonable return on its investments.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas
market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the
earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather
conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas
consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization
mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather
changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
In 2022, net income increased $58 million, or 14.1%, compared to 2021. Operating revenues increased $1.6 billion primarily due to
higher gas cost recovery, rate increases, and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. Gas costs recovered through
natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses increased $1.5 billion
primarily due to a $1.2 billion increase in cost of gas as a result of higher natural gas prices compared to 2021, a $52 million
increase in compensation and benefit expenses, and a $34 million increase in depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in
service. The increase in operating expenses also includes increases of $83 million in costs passed through directly to customers
primarily related to bad debt expenses and revenue taxes. Other income and expense increased $10 million primarily due to an
increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $22 million
primarily due to additional debt issued to finance continued investments. Income taxes increased $25 million primarily due to
higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and Note 11 to the financial
statements for additional information.
Gas Pipeline Investments
Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, Dalton Pipeline,
and PennEast Pipeline. In 2022, net income increased $88 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to impairment
charges in 2021 totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG
resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information.
Gas Marketing Services
Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice
programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas
supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing(*)

services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk
management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.
In 2022, net income increased $6 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $163 million increase in
operating revenues as a result of higher commodity prices, colder weather, and higher sales to commercial customers, partially
offset by a $155 million increase in operating expenses primarily due to $149 million in higher cost of natural gas and an increase
of $3 million in income taxes as a result of higher pre-tax earnings.
All Other
All other includes natural gas storage businesses, a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern
Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest
income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas" for information regarding agreements by certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas to sell two natural gas storage
facilities.
In 2022, net income decreased $12 million compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges in
2022 totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities, largely offset by
$84 million of additional tax expense as a result of the sale of Sequent in 2021, an increase in operating revenues of $17 million
primarily related to higher demand fees and favorable hedge gains at the natural gas storage businesses and higher sales from the
renewable natural gas business, lower depreciation in 2022, and an increase in charitable contributions in 2022. See Note 10 to the
financial statements and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
General
Prices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution service provided by
the natural gas distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-
based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and
may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and/or
processes and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the
traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale
electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power
continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Utility Regulation" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.
Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities
described in Note 15 to the financial statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants'
future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary
businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.
For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments
that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected
long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel,
restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding
and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of higher inflation and
reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the related cost recovery proceedings is another major factor.
Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the
adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce
transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.
Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that caused a
global and national economic recession in 2020 and have been further impacted by the invasion of Ukraine and significant declines
in labor force participation rates. The confluence of these disruptions has resulted in the highest levels of inflation globally in 40
years and driven a significant policy response by central banks across the global economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve has increased
policy interest rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years and to levels high enough to slow economic activity.
These actions and impacts, including increased costs for goods and services and borrowing costs, have led to a significantly
increased risk of recession. Additionally, inflation remains elevated in part due to continued supply chain constraints and labor
markets remaining tight. Electricity sales across all classes have recovered to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels and

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
customer growth at both the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities has remained strong.
However, weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing to declining energy sales. Additionally, the current economic
environment has increased the uncertainty of future energy demand and operating costs. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein
for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2022.
The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including
the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to
execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while
containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's
market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards;
continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission
constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and operational limitations. See "Income Tax
Matters" herein for information regarding recent tax legislation expanding the availability of federal ITCs and PTCs. Also see
Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary
businesses in the gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include
the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of
prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency,
natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and
subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to
limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential across certain parts of the U.S. for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas
or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas'
customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas
marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices,
primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company
Gas' operations to earnings variability and have resulted in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to
this environment. The demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in
the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a
consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production.
Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather;
competition; developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale
customers; customer energy conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to
reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor
supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service
territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global
economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The
contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically,
these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be
followed by the other wholesale customers.
As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide
array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving
other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal
restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from
competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may
significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and
Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of
businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
Environmental Matters
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and
regulations governing air, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern
Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and
II-39
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised
environmental laws and regulations could further affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required
to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and
maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement
decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of
operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental
controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as
related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major
portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing
provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined
at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost
of any deployed technology, fuel prices, the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges, and the ability to continue
recovering the related costs, through rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities
and/or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.
Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP
Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of
environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental
remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty for some of the new costs incurred as a
result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and
renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than
for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns,
including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the
availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about
potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future facility. The impact of
such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be
determined at this time.
Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural
gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and
industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which may have the potential to
affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.
Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or
modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital
expenditures through 2027 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the
traditional electric operating companies are as follows:
2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Total
(in millions)
Southern Company $ 139 $ 125 $ 108 $ 91 $ 50 $ 513 
Alabama Power 53 35 46 28 18 180 
Georgia Power 82 86 56 53 24 301 
Mississippi Power 5 3 7 11 7 33 
These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See "Global Climate Issues"
herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond
closure and groundwater monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants'
ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements" herein and Note 6 to the financial
statements for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Air Quality
Since 1990, the Southern Company system reduced SO and NO air emissions by 99% and 92%, respectively, through 2021. Since
2005, the Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by 97% through 2021.
On March 11, 2022, the EPA released a proposed Federal Implementation Plan to require reductions in NO emissions from
sources in 26 states, including Alabama and Mississippi, to assure those states satisfy their interstate transport (good neighbor)
obligations under the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in downwind states. Georgia and North
Carolina have approved interstate transport state implementation plans related to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS and are not subject to
this rule. The EPA is anticipated to issue a final rule by March 2023 with initial applicability for 2023. The ultimate impact of a
final rule cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in increased compliance costs.
Water Quality
In 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (ELG Reconsideration Rule), a reconsideration of the
2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extended the latest applicability
date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The ELG Reconsideration Rule also updated the voluntary incentive program and
provided new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease
coal combustion by 2028. As required by the ELG Reconsideration Rule, in October 2021, Alabama Power and Georgia Power
each submitted initial notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these subcategories.
Alabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire
Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (350 MWs)
and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4
(1,000 MWs). These plans are expected to be completed on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. The NOPP
submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. With the completion of the Calhoun Generating Station acquisition on
September 30, 2022, Alabama Power expects to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 in late 2023 or early 2024 subject to certain operating
conditions. Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased using coal and began to operate solely on natural gas in December 2022. See Notes 2 and 7 to
the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" and "SEGCO," respectively, for
additional information.
The remaining assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural
gas, have net book values totaling approximately $1.4 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered
through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2022. The net book value of $42 million for retired coal equipment at Plant Barry
Unit 4 was reclassified to a regulatory asset at December 31, 2022. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized
to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and
closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the
Environmental Accounting Order, the regulatory asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful
life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Alabama Power – Rate CNP Compliance" and " – Environmental Accounting Order" for additional information.
Georgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant
Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3
(614 MWs based on 75% ownership) on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. Georgia Power also submitted a
NOPP indicating plans to pursue compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based
on 8.4% ownership) through the voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to
comply with the ELG Rules for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025;
therefore, no NOPP submission was required for these units. The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are
subject to the review of the Georgia EPD.
The Georgia PSC approved the retirements of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (which occurred on August 31, 2022) and Plant Scherer
Unit 3 in its 2022 IRP order, but deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 to
the 2025 IRP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information.2 X

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated
in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking
to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule, referred to as the ELG Supplemental Rule, is expected to be released by
mid-2023. Any revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance strategies.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Coal Combustion Residuals
In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and
gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires
landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met.
Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with
the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the
management and disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the
EPA for its state CCR permitting program, which has broader applicability than the federal rule. The State of Mississippi has not
developed a state CCR permit program.
The Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to
unlined surface impoundments to April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the deadline. The
traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments prior to April
11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. Beginning on January 11, 2022, the EPA has issued numerous Part
A determinations that state its current positions on a variety of CCR Rule compliance requirements, such as criteria for groundwater
corrective action and CCR unit closure. The traditional electric operating companies are working with state regulatory agencies to
determine whether the EPA's current positions may impact closure and groundwater monitoring plans.
On April 8, 2022, the Utilities Solid Waste Activities Group and a group of generating facility operators filed petitions for review in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging whether the EPA's January 11, 2022 actions establish new legislative
rules that should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking. A decision by the court is expected in late 2023. The ultimate
impacts of the EPA's current positions are subject to the outcome of the pending litigation and any potential future rulemaking and
cannot be determined at this time.
Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules,
the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related
cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to closure methodologies, schedules, and/or
costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs
and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued
recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and
the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
"Cash Requirements," Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" and "General Litigation
Matters – Alabama Power," respectively, and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of
waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur
substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies
to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their
financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional
electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of
Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable
state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory
mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory
agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup
costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental
Remediation" for additional information.
Global Climate Issues
In 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule), which repealed and replaced the Clean Power Plan
(CPP) and would have required states to develop unit-specific CO emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on
heat-rate efficiency improvements. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion limiting the EPA's authority2
II-42
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act with a focus on whether such authority allows the EPA to regulate the electric
industry in a manner as broad as the CPP. The EPA has announced its intent to propose a new rule for existing fossil fuel-fired
electric generating units and to propose revised performance standards for new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units pursuant to
the Clean Air Act by April 2023. The ultimate impact of these actions cannot be determined at this time.
In February 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding
universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in
place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years. In April 2021, President Biden announced a new target for
the United States to achieve a 50% to 52% reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The target was
accepted by the United Nations as the United States' nationally determined emissions reduction contribution under the Paris
Agreement.
Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a
lower GHG emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has
transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 22% coal and 51% natural gas in
2022. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 6,700 MWs of coal-fired generating
capacity since 2010 and converting 3,700 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, the
Southern Company system's capacity mix consists of over 11,500 MWs of renewable and storage facilities through ownership and
long-term PPAs. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations – Water Quality" herein for information on plans to retire or convert to
natural gas additional coal-fired generating capacity. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe
material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3
million metric tons of CO equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.
The following table provides the Registrants' 2021 and preliminary 2022 Scope 1 GHG emissions based on equity share of
facilities:
2021 Preliminary 2022
(in million metric tons of CO equivalent)
Southern Company 82 85
Alabama Power 34 35
Georgia Power 23 23
Mississippi Power 8 9
Southern Power 11 13
Southern Company Gas 2 2
(*)Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the
applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007
levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2022 emissions, the Southern
Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 46% since 2007. GHG emissions increased in 2022 due to
an increase in generation when compared to 2021 resulting from increased electricity sales, as discussed further under RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS – "Southern Company – Electricity Business" herein. Southern Company system management expects to
achieve sustained GHG emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are
currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating
companies is working with applicable regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner
responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many
factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy
technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management plans to continue to pursue a diverse portfolio
including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue to transition the Southern Company
system's generating fleet and make the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; implement
initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution operational emissions; continue its research and development with a particular focus on
technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage
with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.2

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Regulatory Matters
See OVERVIEW – "Recent Developments" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters
related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the
applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
Construction Programs
The Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads
on their respective systems. The Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric
generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and
undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.
For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to
be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for information
regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.
See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's
construction of renewable energy facilities.
Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas
distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability, reduce emissions, and meet operational flexibility
and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs
through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement
Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.
See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information regarding the
Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.
Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements
General
Southern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs,
municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide
Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.
Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable
substitute guarantee if (i) S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating,
(ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.
Southern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2022, Southern Power continued to be
successful in remarketing up to 1,175 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs
extending over the next eight years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts
and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.
Natural Gas
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of
agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a
portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or
block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power
serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from
Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the
requirements customers' resources when economically viable.
As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling
agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy
delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated
in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern
II-44
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating
facility.
Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs
based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs,
Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Long-Term Service Agreements" for additional
information.
Solar and Wind
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however,
these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through
an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's
ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from
these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.
Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable
energy credits.
Income Tax Matters
Consolidated Income Taxes
The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to
utilize certain tax credits. See "Tax Credits" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Accounting for Income Taxes" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Tax Credits
Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell facilities, and battery
energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.
Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing
solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind
facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At
December 31, 2022, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of
unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2026, but could be further delayed. Since
2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax
partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern
Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the
financial statements under "Income Taxes" and Note 10 to the financial statements under "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax
Credit Carryforwards" and "Effective Tax Rate" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the
tax benefit related to associated basis differences.
Inflation Reduction Act
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA extends, expands, and increases ITCs and
PTCs for clean energy projects, allows PTCs for solar projects, adds ITCs for stand-alone energy storage projects with an option to
elect out of the tax normalization requirement, and allows for the transferability of the tax credits. The IRA extends and increases
the tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration projects and adds tax credits for clean hydrogen and nuclear projects. Additional
ITC and PTC amounts are available if the projects meet domestic content requirements or are located in low-income or energy
communities. The IRA also enacted a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income, with material adjustments for pension costs
and tax depreciation. The 15% corporate minimum tax on book income can be reduced by energy tax credits.
For solar projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC and an option to claim a PTC instead of
an ITC. Starting in 2023 and through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC for stand-alone energy storage projects. For wind
projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 100% PTC, adjusted for inflation annually. For projects
placed in service before 2022, the 2022 PTC rate is 2.6 cents per KWH. For projects placed in service in 2022, the 2022 PTC rate
II-45
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
is 2.75 cents per KWH. The same PTC rate applies for solar projects for which the PTC option has been elected. To realize the full
value of ITCs and PTCs, the IRA requires satisfaction of prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
Implementation of the IRA provisions is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the
IRS, and the ultimate impacts cannot be determined at this time; however, the IRA is not expected to have a material impact on the
Registrants' financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023.
General Litigation and Other Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings,
cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any
subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not
specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate
liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial
statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being
litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the
notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein).
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the
financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with
the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.
Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their
respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory
agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge
customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate
regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than
when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of
liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities
also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These
estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution
utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants
than they would on a non-regulated company.
Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2022 for the applicable Registrants
were as follows: 88% for Southern Company, 98% for Alabama Power, 97% for Georgia Power, 99% for Mississippi Power, and
88% for Southern Company Gas.
As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management
reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on
applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact
the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable
Registrants.
Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
(Southern Company and Georgia Power)
In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection
with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which
included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project
manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none
of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement
Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should
be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be
reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of
proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3
billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer
refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur
subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4. In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions
upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to
reconsider the decision to continue construction.
As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to $10.6 billion (net of $1.7 billion received
under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes
construction contingency of $60 million and is based on projected in-service dates at the end of the second quarter 2023 and the
first quarter 2024 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. Since 2018, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling
$2.5 billion have been assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are
reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically
states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery for
the $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia
Power in the second quarter 2018 and has not sought rate recovery for any subsequent construction and additional contingency
costs assigned to the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future
recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by
management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax
charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in 2018; $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176 million ($131
million after tax) in the second quarter and the fourth quarter 2020, respectively; $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million
($343 million after tax), $264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax) in the first quarter 2021,
the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021, respectively; and $36 million ($27 million after tax),
$32 million ($24 million after tax), and $148 million ($110 million after tax) in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and
the fourth quarter 2022, respectively.
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases
subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts") or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact those
provisions. The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the
Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton,
respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these
purported tender exercises. On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their
dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of
the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total
approximately $92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20% of MEAG
Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment
for force majeure costs.
Georgia Power recorded additional pre-tax charges (credits) to income of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) in the
fourth quarter 2021 and approximately $16 million ($12 million after tax), $(102) million ($(76) million after tax), and $53 million
($40 million after tax) in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively, associated with
the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of
$407 million associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from
retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's
associated complaint, regarding the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments described in Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts." Georgia Power may be required to
record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $345 million associated with these provisions for OPC and Dalton
based on the current project capital cost forecast.
Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in
the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees
II-47
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia
Power to pay 100% of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia
Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are
placed in service.
As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to
incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of start-up testing and related test results, engineering support,
commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics.
The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up,
which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4
primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning;
maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining
appropriate levels of craft laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases.
Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC
documentation and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel for Unit 4,
may arise, which may result in additional license amendment requests or require other resolution. If any license amendment
requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs for Unit 4, are not resolved in a timely
manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the
second quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the first quarter 2024 for Unit 4, including the joint owner cost sharing and tender impacts
described in Note 2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $15 million per month for Unit
3 and $35 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or
testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other
than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management
will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to
be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.
Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of
any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and
Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia
Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company
Gas)
The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and
valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data,
reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the
statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.
Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of
which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to
that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined
level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of
these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of
Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available
information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized. See Note 10 to the financial statements
under "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax Credit Carryforwards" and " – Net Operating Loss Carryforwards" for additional
information.
Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income
to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the
apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing
II-48
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. Any apportionments and/or filing methodologies ultimately finalized in a
manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for
all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.
Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company
Gas)
AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of
future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the
timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future
removal activities.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule
and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations
related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as
obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term
assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these
assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is
indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these
retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the
ARO.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure
and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the
CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue
periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these
assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial
statements for additional information, including updates to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2022 by certain Registrants.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be
critical accounting estimates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and
Southern Company Gas)
The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of
assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan
assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement
benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are
accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in
future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.
Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the
discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of
determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company
discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of
market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The
II-49
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the
projected benefit obligations.
The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, as described
in Note 11 to the financial statements, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents
the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments.
Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the
LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs
component of net periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the applicable Registrants' long-term assumptions with respect to the
discount rate, salary increases, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets:

Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)
The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded
at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the
date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment
at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year and on an interim basis if events and circumstances
occur that indicate goodwill may be impaired. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating
segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are
aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.
As part of the goodwill impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the
quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant
events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost
II-50
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant
determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to
perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if the fair value
is greater than its carrying amount.
Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.2 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022.
During the fourth quarter 2022, Southern Company recorded a $119 million impairment loss as a result of its annual goodwill
impairment test for PowerSecure.
The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as
well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are
determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset,
and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain
estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be
recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities" for additional information
regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.
Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the
asset carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual
disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the fair value of the asset
is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. In addition,
when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets or asset
group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these
evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years. Impairments
of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory
disallowances.
Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities,
Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets.
For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period
losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, changes in tax
legislation, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract,
or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment
indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules,
current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices,
the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition
rates, or the inability to deploy a development project.
As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves
management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an
impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
During 2021 and 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling $7 million ($6 million after tax) and $206 million
($105 million after tax), respectively, related to its leveraged lease investments. During 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-
tax impairment charges totaling $131 million ($99 million after tax) related to natural gas storage facilities. During 2021, Southern
Company Gas recorded total pre-tax impairment charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity method
investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" and
"Southern Company Leveraged Lease," respectively, and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent
asset impairments.
Revenue Recognition (Southern Power)
Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-
derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges.
Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification,
II-51
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern
Power are described further below.
Lease Transactions
Southern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or
contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in
exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine
whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, Southern Power's power sales contracts that are
determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are
recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. For those contracts that are determined to be sales-type
leases, capacity revenues are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment in the lease and are included in
Southern Power's operating revenues. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.
Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative Transactions
If the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of
a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a
normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment,
including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating
capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.
Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts.
For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues
related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to
the financial statements for additional information.
Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)
Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power
will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. Acquisitions that meet the definition of a business are
accounted for under the acquisition method, whereby the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based
on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to
acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase
price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may
engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions,
and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts,
discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for
potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional
information on recent acquisitions.
Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)
Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern
Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to
the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.
If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of
operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and
whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in
membership interests.
Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing
arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these
arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV
at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.
Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)
The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that
subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the
financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their
exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus,
the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the
Registrants.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for
reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The
discontinuation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of LIBOR is June 30, 2023, which is beyond the original
effective date of ASU 2020-04; therefore, on December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic
848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06) to defer the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to
December 31, 2024.
The amendments are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that
reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under
current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships
affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held
to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from
March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to
modifications of debt and derivative arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06.
The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at
Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these
agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. No material
impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to continue. See
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Overview" and "Financing Activities" herein and Note 14 to the financial
statements under "Interest Rate Derivatives" for additional information.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Overview
The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2022. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily
consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital
expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital
expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to build new
generation facilities to meet projected long-term demand requirements and to replace units being retired as part of the generation
fleet transition, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental
modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution
facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may
include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's
performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected
long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these
systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information.
Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2022, Southern Power utilized tax credits,
which provided $49 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2023 through 2025, projected stock dividends,
capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows for each of Southern Company, the traditional
electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its
operating cash flows through one or more of the following: accessing borrowings from financial institutions, issuing debt and
hybrid securities in the capital markets, and/or through its stock plans. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial
institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership
contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other
working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit
arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional
information.
To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), the Registrants have established an initiative to
assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark
rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated and implemented. Substantially all of the Registrants' credit facilities allow for
LIBOR to be phased out and replaced with SOFR and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR transition through the adoption
of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and subsequent amendments. None of the Registrants expects the transition from
LIBOR to have a material impact.
The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their
nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. No
contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2022 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans
are anticipated during 2023. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" and "Pension Plans,"
respectively, for additional information.
At the end of 2022, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $71.41 per share (based on the closing price as
reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $27.93 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 256%, compared to
$68.58, $26.30, and 261%, respectively, at the end of 2021.
Cash Requirements
Capital Expenditures
Total estimated capital expenditures, including LTSA and nuclear fuel commitments, for the Registrants through 2027 based on
their current construction programs are as follows:
2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
(in billions)
Southern Company $ 9.1 $ 8.1 $ 7.7 $ 7.9 $ 7.7

(a)Includes expenditures of approximately $0.1 billion in 2023 for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama
Power" for additional information.
(b)Includes expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.2 billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively, for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
(c)Excludes approximately $0.5 billion in 2023 and $0.8 billion per year for 2024 through 2027 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions and placeholder growth,
which may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.
These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential
compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2022,

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate continued expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash
ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants'
ARO liabilities. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The
cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for
others. These estimated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are
refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2027 are provided in the table below. Material
expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power
and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the
financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and
Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein.

Georgia Power 295 330 345 482 469 
Mississippi Power 21 25 31 17 2 
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in
environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating
plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to
meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected
environmental compliance program; changes in legislation and/or regulation; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction
labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or
regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impair the
ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance
that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern
Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and
construction projects.
The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new
technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be
subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction
expenditures.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Construction Programs" herein for additional information.
Other Significant Cash Requirements
Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the
Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2022,
the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the
next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Fuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Commitments" for information on
Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and
purchased power commitments at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs
include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions
for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on
various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at
December 31, 2022. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the
applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2022
that extend beyond 2027 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for
various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the
financial statements.

In connection with Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, the Georgia PSC approved five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power, which are
expected to be accounted for as leases, and are contingent upon approval by the FERC. The expected capacity payments associated
with the PPAs total $5 million in 2024, $68 million in 2025, $75 million in 2026, $76 million in 2027, and $670 million thereafter.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance
support for certain of their generating facilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Long-term Service Agreements" for
additional information. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures related to LTSAs are included in
the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027. Total estimated payments for LTSA

Sources of Capital
Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings from financial institutions,
and debt, hybrid, and/or equity issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock
plans, private placements, or public offerings.(*)

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the
past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and
equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as
discussed further herein). Georgia Power intends to continue utilizing short-term floating rate bank loans and commercial paper
issuances to fund operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery.
The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2023, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment
opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals
(for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information.
Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the
federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for
using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2022, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for
existing tax equity partnerships totaling $51 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under "General" and "Southern
Power," respectively, for additional information.
The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the
applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term
securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public
offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its
subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration
statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the
appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate
filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.
The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial
statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a
centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the
Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.
The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are
loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these
arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial
paper program.
Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas,
which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper
programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital
needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries
benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to
affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the amount of subsidiary retained
earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.5 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash
obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently
anticipated cash obligations.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic
use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan
to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see "Financing
Activities" herein for information on financing activities that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2022. The following table
shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants:

Current liabilities in excess of current assets $ 5,308 $ 3,179 $ 50 $ 263 $ 532 
The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as
commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances,
the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.
Bank Credit Arrangements

Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b)Includes $798 million and $950 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.
Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit
arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the
maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of the unused credit with banks is
allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper
programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric
operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2022 was approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of
approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition,
at December 31, 2022, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $120 million and $288 million, respectively, of fixed
rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. See Note 8 to the financial statements

Short-term Borrowings
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the
liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers or
obligors under its commercial paper program. Commercial paper and short-term bank term loans are included in notes payable in

Financing activities 1,945 438 867 33 (195) 745 
Fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of
securities.
Southern Company
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $133 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of
vendor payments and increased natural gas cost recovery at the natural gas distribution utilities, largely offset by decreased fuel
cost recovery at the traditional electric operating companies.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to the Subsidiary Registrants' construction
programs.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term debt, the issuance of
common stock to settle the purchase contracts entered into as part of the Equity Units (as discussed in Note 8 to the financial
statements under "Equity Units"), and an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term and short-term debt,
partially offset by common stock dividend payments.
Alabama Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $414 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to decreased fuel
cost recovery, the timing of customer receivable collections, and fossil fuel stock purchases, partially offset by the timing of vendor
payments.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to gross property additions, including
approximately $211 million and $240 million, respectively, related to the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 and, for 2022, $171
million related to the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama
Power" for additional information.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to net long-term debt issuances and capital
contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by common stock dividend payments and, in 2022, preferred stock
redemptions.
Georgia Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $709 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to decreased fuel
cost recovery and the timing of customer receivable collections, partially offset by lower income and property tax payments.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to gross property additions, including
approximately $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information on construction of Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to a net increase in short-term bank debt, capital
contributions from Southern Company, and net issuances of senior notes, partially offset by common stock dividend payments. The
net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to capital contributions from Southern Company,
borrowings from the FFB for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and net issuances and reofferings of other debt, partially
offset by common stock dividend payments.
Mississippi Power
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $137 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of
vendor payments, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to gross property additions.
The net cash used for financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments, partially offset by
capital contributions from Southern Company and the issuance of revenue bonds. The net cash provided from financing activities in
2021 was primarily related to the issuance of senior notes and capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by
debt redemptions, common stock dividend payments, and a decrease in commercial paper borrowings.
Southern Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $136 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the
utilization of federal ITCs, partially offset by an increase in wholesale revenues driven by higher market prices of energy.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 was primarily related to ongoing construction activities. The net cash used for
investing activities in 2021 was primarily related to the acquisition of the Deuel Harvest wind facility and ongoing construction
activities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
The net cash used for financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to the repayment of senior notes at maturity, common stock
dividend payments, and net capital distributions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by capital contributions from Southern
Company. The net cash used for financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to a return of capital to Southern Company and
common stock dividend payments, partially offset by net capital contributions from noncontrolling interests and net issuances of
senior notes.
Southern Company Gas
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $856 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increased natural
gas cost recovery and the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2022 and 2021 was primarily related to construction of transportation and distribution
assets recovered through base rates and infrastructure investment recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution
operations, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
The net cash provided from financing activities in 2022 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term debt and capital
contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by common stock dividend payments and a decrease in short-term

contract.
Credit Rating Risk
At December 31, 2022, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.
There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of
certain Registrants to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases
and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management,
and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

(*)Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require
credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade.
Southern Power had $106 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2022.
The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements
that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade.
Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating
downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they
do so.
Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), have agreements under which Mississippi
Power provides retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through at least 2038. The(*) (*)

agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is
exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in
steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three
rating agencies.
On February 22, 2022, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to BBB+ from A- with a
stable outlook.
Also on February 22, 2022, Fitch revised the ratings outlook of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Southern Power, Nicor Gas,
and SEGCO to negative from stable.
On December 15, 2022, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive.
Market Price Risk
The Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2021. See Note 14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well
as Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional information.
Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric
operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the
guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in
natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its
wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling
agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has
been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating
capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of
contracts are priced at market.
Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to
economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a
variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap
agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business also actively manages storage positions through a variety of
hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments
are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between
periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining earnings. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may
not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.

mmBtu at December 31, 2022 and the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 6
million mmBtu at December 31, 2021.
For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was approximately $0.08 per mmBtu
above market prices at December 31, 2022 and was approximately $0.74 per mmBtu below market prices at December 31, 2021.
The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural
gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered
through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.(a) (a)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market
observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-
observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value
measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at
December 31, 2022 were as follows:

The Registrants are exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative
contracts, as applicable. The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have
investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit
exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note 14 to the financial statements.
Credit Risk
Southern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed
to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.
Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which
consist of the 14 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the
non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of
natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit
security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.
For 2022, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 13% of Southern Company
Gas' operating revenues and 15% of operating revenues for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment.
Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted
from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to
Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of
credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas
reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each
Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and
report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.(a)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage
capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the
interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.
Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit
reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company
Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements
and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns
physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch
ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (Southern
Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited
Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
Southern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility
subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 88% of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2022 and 87% of its consolidated total assets at December 31, 2022, are subject to rate regulation by their respective
state Public Service Commissions or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that the regulated utility subsidiaries meet
the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to
account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate
regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and
equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits
related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance
expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and
approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility
service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an
impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered
through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable
rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers
through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility
service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and
remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future
regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future
rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a
refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future
decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the
rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the
subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in
rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the regulated utility subsidiaries, regulatory statutes,
interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the
likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of
similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded
regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
II-73
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Southern Company's regulated utility
subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that
might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Southern Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.
Disclosure of Uncertainties – Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction – Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment
in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact
of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by
the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its
ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and
schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery. The projected schedule for Unit 3
primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by
further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on
potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall
construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of
craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes construction and transitions further into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include
the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining commodities installation;
completion of documentation to support Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) submittals; the pace of
remaining work package closures and system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical support resources.
Ongoing or future challenges for both units also include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance;
and/or related cost escalation. New challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-up and commissioning and Unit
4 moves further into testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems,
structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in
the global nuclear industry at this scale). These challenges may result in further schedule delays and/or cost increases.
The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments
by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the
significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these
matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory
proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $183 million in 2022.
In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1)
the status of construction and testing; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the
co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the
project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and
uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This
critical audit matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge
of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the
ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the
construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the methodology and assumptions used
to determine the forecasted costs and the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's
processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule.
II-74
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
•We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors),
independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and
schedule challenges.
•We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of
construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties
impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the
construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential
risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
•We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and
cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs
and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any
potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
•We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to
the licensing and commercial operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all
our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of
construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact
the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alabama Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alabama Power as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Alabama Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Alabama Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Alabama Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Alabama Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Alabama Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Alabama Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income
taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and
depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Alabama Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory
proceedings based on an analysis of Alabama Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its
investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of
return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of
rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Alabama
Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not
II-82
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business
and a reasonable return on those investments.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs and the remaining net book
values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on
the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs,
(2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers.
Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the
Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting
process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of
audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in
rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Alabama Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Alabama Power and other interested parties
that may impact Alabama Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Alabama Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Georgia Power as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Georgia Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Georgia Power's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Georgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Georgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income
taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and
depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory
proceedings based on an analysis of Georgia Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment
in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned
on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is
premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Georgia Power
expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not
II-89
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business
and a reasonable return on those investments.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and
remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future
regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future
rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a
refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future
decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the
rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the
subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in
rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Georgia Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Georgia Power and other interested parties
that may impact Georgia Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Georgia Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.
Disclosure of Uncertainties – Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction – Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in the construction of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by
Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the
Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover
its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject
to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the
progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component,
and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4
testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production
levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes
construction and transitions further into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the timeframe and duration of hot
functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining commodities installation; completion of documentation to support
Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) submittals; the pace of remaining work package closures and
system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical support resources. Ongoing or future challenges for both
units also include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; and/or related cost escalation. New
challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-up and commissioning and Unit 4 moves
II-90
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
further into testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems,
structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in
the global nuclear industry at this scale). These challenges may result in further schedule delays and/or cost increases.
The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments
by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings. After considering the
significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these
matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory
proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $183 million in 2022.
In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1)
the status of construction and testing; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the
co-owners of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the
project. We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and
uncertainties that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This
critical audit matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge
of rate regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the
ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the
construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the methodology and assumptions used
to determine the forecasted costs and the projected in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Georgia Power's
processes for on-going evaluation and monitoring of the construction schedule.
•We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors),
independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and
schedule challenges.
•We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of
construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties
impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the
construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential
risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
•We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction and
cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs
and to evaluate the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any
potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
•We monitored the status of reviews and inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to
the licensing and commercial operation of the project that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all
our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of
construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact
the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Mississippi Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Mississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets – asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations;
deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues;
operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in
regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of,
its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate
of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions' regulation of
rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While
Mississippi Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions
II-97
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility
business and a reasonable return on those investments.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and
the remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of
future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in
future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, and/or (3) a refund to customers.
Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the
Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting
process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of
audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Mississippi Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Mississippi Power and other interested parties
that may impact Mississippi Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Mississippi Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and subsidiary companies (Southern
Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as
the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Southern Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Southern Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Southern Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Income/Loss Allocation to Noncontrolling Interests – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Power has entered into a number of tax equity partnership arrangements, wherein they agree to sell 100% of a class of
membership interests (e.g. Class A) in an entity to a noncontrolling investor in exchange for cash contributions, while retaining
control of the entity through a separate class of membership interests (e.g. Class B). The agreements for these partnerships give
different rights and priorities to their owners in terms of cash distributions, tax attribute allocations, and partnership income or loss
allocations. These provisions make the conventional equity method of accounting where an investor applies its "percentage
ownership interest" to the investee's net income under generally accepted accounting principles to determine the investor's share of
earnings or losses difficult to apply. Therefore, Southern Power uses the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV)
accounting method to account for these partnership arrangements. The HLBV accounting method calculates each partner's share of
income or loss based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim at the end of the reporting period compared to the
beginning of the reporting period. The application of the HLBV accounting method by Southern Power required significant
consideration of the allocations between Southern Power and the noncontrolling investors over the life of the agreement and the
liquidation provisions of the agreement to determine the appropriate allocation of income or loss between the parties.
II-104
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
The determination of the appropriate amount of allocated partnership income or loss to noncontrolling interests using the HLBV
accounting method required increased audit effort and specialized skill and knowledge, including evaluation of the terms of the
agreement and consideration of the appropriateness of the HLBV model based on the provisions of the agreement.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures included the following, among others:
•For agreements that result in potentially material allocations of partnership income or loss, we read the agreements to
understand the liquidation provisions and the provisions governing the allocation of benefits.
•We evaluated the HLBV models utilized by management to determine whether the models accurately reflect the allocation of
income or loss and tax attributes in accordance with the liquidation provisions and allocation terms defined in the agreements,
as well as whether the inputs in the models are accurate and complete.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Company Gas and subsidiary companies (Southern
Company Gas) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Southern Company Gas as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
We did not audit the financial statements of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), Southern Company Gas' investment
which is accounted for by the use of the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Southern Company
Gas include its equity investment in SNG of $1,243 million and $1,129 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively, and its earnings from its equity method investment in SNG of $146 million, $127 million, and $129 million for the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose reports
(which express unqualified opinions on SNG's financial statements and contain an emphasis of matter paragraph calling attention to
SNG's significant transactions with related parties) have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for SNG, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Company Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on Southern Company Gas' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
Southern Company Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Southern Company Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Company Gas' internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Southern Company Gas) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 88%
of Southern Company Gas' consolidated revenues, are subject to rate regulation in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia by
their respective state Public Service Commission or other applicable state regulatory agencies (collectively, the "Commissions").
Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of regulation. Accounting for
II-112
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to,
property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred
charges and credits related to income taxes; operating revenues; other operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and
amortization.
The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and
approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility
service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an
impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered
through rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable
rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from
customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing
utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on those investments.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the
impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1)
recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under
construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the
outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate
regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management
estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and/or deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refunds or future reductions in
rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in
Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by
intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction
in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the
external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other
interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict
management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future
reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Members
Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C.
Houston, Texas
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, members' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial
statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate

Postretirement Benefit Obligation
At December 31, 2022, the Company's postretirement benefit obligation was $14 million and the Company's plan assets were $59
million, resulting in a net asset position of $45 million. As described in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the
postretirement benefit obligation is primarily based on actuarial calculations, which include various significant assumptions.
We identified the Company's estimate of the postretirement benefit obligation as a critical audit matter. Auditing the postretirement
benefit obligation required complex auditor judgment due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions used in the
calculation, which include the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions had a significant effect on
the postretirement benefit obligation calculation.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
•Comparing the actuarial assumptions used by management with historical trends and evaluating the change in the
postretirement benefit obligation from prior year due to changes in assumptions.
•Evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity
and duration of the benefit payments.
•Evaluating the expected return on plan assets by assessing whether management's assumptions were consistent with a
range of returns for a portfolio of comparative investments that was determined based on publicly available information.
Emphasis of Matter – Significant Transactions with Related Parties
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into significant transactions with related
parties.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General
Southern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern
Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated
utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages
power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market.
Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas
Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other
complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1,
2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized
services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by
Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services
within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides
services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,
which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids
for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.
The Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant
influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary.
Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing
arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these
arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV
method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the
end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See "Variable Interest Entities" herein and Note 7 for additional
information.
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other
subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution
utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the
respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and
comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ
from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for
reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The
discontinuation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of LIBOR is June 30, 2023, which is beyond the original
effective date of ASU 2020-04; therefore, on December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic
848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06) to defer the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to
December 31, 2024.
The amendments are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that
reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under
current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships
affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held
to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively
II-122
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to
modifications of debt and derivative arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06.
The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at
Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these
agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. No material
impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to continue. See
Note 14 under "Interest Rate Derivatives" for additional information.
Affiliate Transactions
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have agreements with SCS under which
certain of the following services are rendered to them at direct or allocated cost: general executive and advisory, general and design
engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance, treasury, legal, tax, information technology, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communications, cellular tower
space, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and Southern Company power pool
transactions. These costs are primarily included in other operations and maintenance expenses or capitalized to property, plant, and
equipment. Costs for these services from SCS in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows:

management of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for Georgia Power.
Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS and Southern Nuclear prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, as amended, were approved by the SEC. Subsequently, additional cost allocation methodologies have been reported to the
FERC and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at cost by system service
companies.

SCS, as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, has agreements with certain subsidiaries of
Southern Company Gas to purchase natural gas. Natural gas purchases made under these agreements were immaterial for Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power for all periods presented and immaterial, $18 million, and $26 million for Southern
Power in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Alabama Power and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Greene County. The companies have an agreement under which Alabama
Power operates Plant Greene County and Mississippi Power reimburses Alabama Power for its proportionate share of non-fuel
operations and maintenance expenses, which totaled $6 million, $10 million, and $9 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information.
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each have agreements with PowerSecure for equipment purchases and/or
services related to utility infrastructure construction, distributed energy, and energy efficiency projects. Costs under these
agreements were immaterial for all periods presented.
In 2022, Southern Company Gas entered into a $70 million contract with the U.S. General Services Administration to increase
energy efficiency at certain federal buildings across Georgia, with completion expected to occur in 2024. Southern Company Gas
engaged PowerSecure to provide the majority of the construction services under the contract. During 2022, Southern Company Gas
paid $10 million to PowerSecure related to this agreement.
See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for information regarding Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's equity method investment in SEGCO
and related affiliate purchased power costs, as well as Alabama Power's gas pipeline ownership agreement with SEGCO.
Southern Power has several agreements with SCS for transmission services, which are billed to Southern Power based on the
Southern Company Open Access Transmission Tariff as filed with the FERC. Transmission services purchased by Southern Power
from SCS totaled $39 million, $28 million, and $15 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and were charged to other
operations and maintenance expenses in Southern Power's consolidated statements of income.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural
gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally
liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 14 under "Contingent Features" for additional information.
Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above transactions on a
monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the purchase or sale of electricity. See "Revenues –
Southern Power" herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas provide incidental services to and
receive such services from other Southern Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. Except as
described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas neither provided nor
received any material services to or from affiliates in any year presented.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to accounting requirements for the
effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent costs recovered that are expected to be
incurred in the future or probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process.
In the event that a portion of a traditional electric operating company's or a natural gas distribution utility's operations is no longer
subject to applicable accounting rules for rate regulation, such company would be required to write off to income or reclassify to
AOCI related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the
II-124
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
traditional electric operating company or the natural gas distribution utility would be required to determine if any impairment to
other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities
are to be reflected in rates. See Note 2 for additional information including details of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the
balance sheets for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas.
Revenues
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources which are accounted for under various revenue accounting guidance,
including revenue from contracts with customers, lease, derivative, and regulatory accounting. See Notes 4, 9, and 14 for additional
information.
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The majority of the revenues of the traditional electric operating companies are generated from contracts with retail electric
customers. These revenues, generated from the integrated service to deliver electricity when and if called upon by the customer, are
recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over time, at a tariff rate, and as electricity is delivered to the customer
during the month. Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Retail rates may include
provisions to adjust revenues for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered from or returned to
customers, respectively, through adjustments to the billing factors. See Note 2 for additional information regarding regulatory
matters of the traditional electric operating companies.
Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms. Energy and other revenues are
generally recognized as services are provided. The contracts for capacity and energy in a wholesale PPA have multiple performance
obligations where the contract's total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling
price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services
transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, the traditional electric operating companies recognize revenue as the
performance obligations are satisfied over time as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is available to
the customer.
For both retail and wholesale revenues, the traditional electric operating companies have elected to recognize revenue for their sales
of electricity and capacity using the invoice practical expedient as they generally have a right to consideration in an amount that
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date and that may be invoiced. Payment for
goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of the Registrants' performance
obligation.
Southern Power
Southern Power sells capacity and energy at rates specified under contractual terms in long-term PPAs. These PPAs are accounted
for as leases, non-derivatives, or normal sale derivatives. Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as operating leases are recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Energy revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered.
Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as sales-type leases are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment
in the lease.
Southern Power's non-lease contracts commonly include capacity and energy which are considered separate performance
obligations. In these contracts, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling
price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services
transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Power recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are
satisfied over time, as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is made available to the customer.
Southern Power generally has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the
performance completed to date and may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. Payment for
goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of Southern Power's performance
obligation.
When multiple contracts exist with the same counterparty, the revenues from each contract are accounted for as separate
arrangements.
Southern Power may also enter into contracts to sell short-term capacity in the wholesale electricity markets. These sales are
generally classified as mark-to-market derivatives and net unrealized gains and losses on such contracts are recorded in wholesale
revenues. See Note 14 and "Financial Instruments" herein for additional information.

Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas records revenues when goods or services are provided to customers. Those revenues are based on rates
approved by the state regulatory agencies of the natural gas distribution utilities. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated natural
gas market whereby Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle
customer billing functions. As required by the Georgia PSC, Atlanta Gas Light bills Marketers in equal monthly installments for
each residential, commercial, and industrial end-use customer's distribution costs as well as for capacity costs utilizing a seasonal
rate design for the calculation of each residential end-use customer's annual straight-fixed-variable charge, which reflects the
historic volumetric usage pattern for the entire residential class.
The majority of the revenues of Southern Company Gas are generated from contracts with natural gas distribution customers.
Revenues from this integrated service to deliver gas when and if called upon by the customer are recognized as a single
performance obligation satisfied over time and are recognized at a tariff rate as gas is delivered to the customer during the month.
The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred
with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Company Gas recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are
satisfied over time as natural gas is delivered to the customer. The performance obligations related to wholesale gas services are
satisfied, and revenue is recognized, at a point in time when natural gas is delivered to the customer.
Southern Company Gas has elected to recognize revenue for sales of gas using the invoice practical expedient as it generally has a
right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date
and that may be invoiced. Payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction
of Southern Company Gas' performance obligation.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities have rate structures that include volumetric rate
designs that allow the opportunity to recover certain costs based on gas usage. Revenues from sales and transportation services are
recognized in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers. Revenues from residential and certain
commercial and industrial customers are recognized on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Additionally, unbilled revenues are
recognized for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers, from the last bill date to the end of the accounting
period. For other commercial and industrial customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries through the end of the period.
The tariffs for the natural gas distribution utilities include provisions which allow for the recognition of certain revenues prior to the
time such revenues are billed to customers. These provisions are referred to as alternative revenue programs and provide for the
recognition of certain revenues prior to billing, as long as the amounts recognized will be collected from customers within 24
months of recognition. Revenue related to alternative revenue programs was $(5) million, $11 million, and $3 million in 2022,
2021, and 2020, respectively. These programs are as follows:
•Weather normalization adjustments – reduce customer bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increase
customer bills when weather is warmer than normal and are included in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas and
Chattanooga Gas;
•Revenue normalization mechanisms – mitigate the impact of conservation and declining customer usage and are contained
in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas and Nicor Gas; and
•Revenue true-up adjustment – included within the provisions of the GRAM program in which Atlanta Gas Light
participates as a short-term alternative to formal rate case filings, the revenue true-up feature provides for a positive (or
negative) adjustment to record revenue in the amount of any variance to budgeted revenues, which are submitted and
approved annually as a requirement of GRAM. Such adjustments are reflected in customer billings in a subsequent
program year.
Wholesale Gas Services
Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas netted revenues from energy and risk management activities
with the associated costs. Profits from sales between segments were eliminated and recognized as goods or services sold to end-use
customers. Southern Company Gas recorded wholesale gas services' transactions that qualified as derivatives at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change and characterized as unrealized gains or losses. Gains and
losses on derivatives held for energy trading purposes were presented on a net basis in revenue. See Note 15 under "Southern
Company Gas" for additional information on the sale of Sequent.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues from natural gas sales and transportation services in the same period in which the
related volumes are delivered to customers and recognizes sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial
customers on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Southern Company Gas also recognizes unbilled revenues for estimated
deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers from the most recent meter reading date to the end of the accounting period. For
other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries during the
period.
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues on 12-month utility-bill management contracts as the lesser of cumulative earned or
cumulative billed amounts.
Concentration of Revenue
Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power (with the exception of its full requirements cost-based
MRA electric tariffs described below), Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas each have a diversified base of customers and
no single customer or industry comprises 10% or more of each company's revenues.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based MRA electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the
FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022.
Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are
likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Fuel Costs
Fuel costs for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense
generally includes fuel transportation costs and the cost of purchased emissions allowances as they are used. For Alabama Power
and Georgia Power, fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel. For the traditional electric operating
companies, fuel costs also include gains and/or losses from fuel-hedging programs as approved by their respective state PSCs.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, Southern Company Gas charges its utility
customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies.
Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to
regulatory review. Southern Company Gas defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of
commodity revenue earned in a given period such that no operating income is recognized related to these costs. The deferred or
accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred and
accrued natural gas costs are included in the balance sheets as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, respectively.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services' customers are charged for actual or estimated natural gas consumed. Within cost of
natural gas, Southern Company Gas also includes costs of lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of
inventories to market value, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Income Taxes
The Registrants use the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all
significant income tax temporary differences. In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional
electric operating companies are amortized over the average life of the related property, with such amortization normally applied as
a credit to reduce depreciation and amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural gas distribution
utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are amortized to income tax expense over the life of the
respective asset.
Under current tax law, certain projects at Southern Power related to the construction of renewable facilities are eligible for federal
ITCs. Southern Power estimates eligible costs which, as they relate to acquisitions, may not be finalized until the allocation of the
purchase price to assets has been finalized. Southern Power applies the deferred method to ITCs, whereby the ITCs are recorded as
a deferred credit and amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. Furthermore, the tax basis of the asset is
reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit
of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. State
ITCs are recognized as an income tax benefit in the period in which the credits are generated. In addition, certain projects are
eligible for federal and state PTCs, which are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production.
II-127
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Federal ITCs and PTCs, as well as state ITCs and other state tax credits available to reduce income taxes payable, were not fully
utilized in 2022 and will be carried forward and utilized in future years. In addition, Southern Company is expected to have various
state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for certain of its subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power and Southern Power, which
would result in income tax benefits in the future, if utilized. See Note 10 under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes – Tax Credit
Carryforwards" and " – Net Operating Loss Carryforwards" for additional information.
The Registrants recognize tax positions that are "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination by the appropriate
taxing authorities. See Note 10 under "Unrecognized Tax Benefits" for additional information.
Other Taxes
Taxes imposed on and collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies are presented net on the Registrants'
statements of income and are excluded from the transaction price in determining the revenue related to contracts with a customer.
Southern Company Gas is taxed on its gas revenues by various governmental authorities, but is allowed to recover these taxes from
its customers. Revenue taxes imposed on the natural gas distribution utilities are recorded at the amount charged to customers,
which may include a small administrative fee, as operating revenues, and the related taxes imposed on Southern Company Gas are
recorded as operating expenses on the statements of income. Revenue taxes included in operating expenses were $158 million,
$119 million, and $104 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities record AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not
realized currently, AFUDC increases the revenue requirement and is recovered over the service life of the asset through a higher
rate base and higher depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not taxable.
Interest related to financing the construction of new facilities at Southern Power and new facilities not included in the traditional
electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' regulated rates is capitalized in accordance with standard interest
capitalization requirements.
Total AFUDC and interest capitalized for the Registrants in 2022, 2021, and 2020 was as follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an
impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset
group's carrying amount, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the
carrying amount of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the
amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying amount is greater
than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying amount is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to
sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated
when circumstances or events change. See Notes 7 and 9 under "Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Leveraged
Lease," respectively, and Note 15 under "Southern Company" and "Southern Company Gas" for information regarding impairment
charges recorded during the periods presented.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities
Southern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective
PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by
Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016
acquisition of PowerSecure.
For its 2022 and 2020 annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas management performed the qualitative assessment and
determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying
amounts, and therefore no quantitative assessment was required. For its 2021 annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas
management performed the quantitative assessment and confirmed that the fair values of all of its reporting units with goodwill
exceeded their carrying amounts.
For its 2021 and 2020 annual impairment tests, PowerSecure management performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in
the fair value of PowerSecure exceeding its carrying amount. For its 2022 annual impairment test, PowerSecure management
performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of PowerSecure being lower than its carrying amount. The
fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. The decline in fair value primarily resulted from declining
macroeconomic conditions, reducing sales growth and estimated cash flows. As a result, a goodwill impairment of $119 million
was recorded in the fourth quarter 2022. The worldwide disruptions in supply chain, reduced labor availability and productivity,
and reduced economic activity in the United States have had a variety of adverse impacts on Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including PowerSecure. If these factors continue to negatively affect the operating results of PowerSecure, all or a
portion of its remaining goodwill of $144 million may become impaired.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, goodwill was as follows:

Acquisition Accounting
At the time of an acquisition, management will assess whether acquired assets and activities meet the definition of a business.
Acquisitions that meet the definition of a business are accounted for under the acquisition method, and operating results from the
date of acquisition are included in the acquiring entity's financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent
consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any
intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The
purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and management may engage
independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and
typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts,
discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred for potential or
successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
Historically, contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once an acquired construction project is
placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, management fair values the arrangement with any changes
recorded in the statements of income. See Note 13 for additional fair value information.
Development Costs
For Southern Power, development costs are capitalized once a project is probable of completion, primarily based on a review of its
economics and operational feasibility, as well as the status of power off-take agreements and regulatory approvals, if applicable.
Southern Power's capitalized development costs are included in CWIP on the balance sheets. All of Southern Power's development
costs incurred prior to the determination that a project is probable of completion are expensed as incurred and included in other
operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income. If it is determined that a project is no longer probable of
completion, any of Southern Power's capitalized development costs are expensed and included in other operations and maintenance
expense in the statements of income.
Long-Term Service Agreements
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance
support for certain of their generating facilities. The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which
generally includes the cost of all labor and materials. The LTSAs also obligate the counterparties to cover the costs of unplanned
maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in each contract.
Payments made under the LTSAs for the performance of any planned inspections or unplanned capital maintenance are recorded in
the statements of cash flows as investing activities. Receipts of major parts into materials and supplies inventory prior to planned
inspections are treated as noncash transactions in the statements of cash flows. Any payments made prior to the work being
performed are recorded as prepayments in other current assets and noncurrent assets on the balance sheets. At the time work is
performed, an appropriate amount is accrued for future payments or transferred from the prepayment and recorded as property,
plant, and equipment or expensed.
Transmission Receivables/Prepayments
As a result of Southern Power's acquisition and construction of generating facilities, Southern Power has transmission receivables
and/or prepayments representing the portion of interconnection network and transmission upgrades that will be reimbursed to
Southern Power. Upon completion of the related project, transmission costs are generally reimbursed by the interconnection
provider within a five-year period and the receivable/prepayments are reduced as payments or services are received.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments
are securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves
Each traditional electric operating company maintains a reserve to cover or is allowed to defer and recover the cost of damages
from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and, for Mississippi Power, the cost of uninsured damages to its
generation facilities and other property. Alabama Power also has authority from the Alabama PSC to accrue certain additional
amounts as circumstances warrant. Alabama Power recorded additional accruals of $65 million and $100 million in 2021 and 2020,
respectively, which are included in the table below. In accordance with their respective state PSC orders, the traditional electric
operating companies accrued the following amounts related to storm damage recovery in 2022, 2021, and 2020:

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies for the traditional electric operating companies generally includes the average cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes propane gas
inventory, liquefied natural gas inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power
generally includes the average cost of generating plant materials.
Materials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as
appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and
then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.
Fuel Inventory
Fuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and
emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil,
natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost,
as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating
companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.
Natural Gas for Sale
With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas records natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. In Georgia's
deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a monthly
basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along with a
corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related
natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.
Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored
prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not
restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of
natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for
differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or
Southern Company Gas' net income. At December 31, 2022, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $170 million. Based on the
average cost of gas purchased in December 2022, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2022
was $613 million.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and all other segments record inventory at LOCOM, with cost determined on a
WACOG basis. For these segments, Southern Company Gas evaluates the weighted average cost of its natural gas inventories
against market prices to determine whether any declines in market prices below the WACOG are other than temporary. For any
declines considered to be other than temporary, Southern Company Gas records LOCOM adjustments to cost of natural gas to
reduce the value of its natural gas inventories to market value. LOCOM adjustments were immaterial for all periods presented.
Provision for Uncollectible Accounts
The customers of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are billed monthly. For the
majority of receivables, a provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on historical collection experience and other
factors. For the remaining receivables, if the company is aware of a specific customer's inability to pay, a provision for
uncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If
circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could
affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions.
Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts
averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.
Credit risk exposure at Nicor Gas is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides
for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis
and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which
consist of 14 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the
lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and
sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light
to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from
Atlanta Gas Light.
Financial Instruments
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency
exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices,
weather, interest rates, and commodity prices. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheets (included in "Other" or shown separately as "Risk Management Activities") and are measured at fair value. See Note
13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern
Power's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are excluded from fair value accounting
requirements because they qualify for the "normal" scope exception, and are accounted for under the accrual method. Derivative
contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional electric operating
companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of related gains and losses in AOCI
or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other derivative contracts that qualify as fair
value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. Cash
flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category as the hedged item. See Note 14 for
additional information regarding derivatives.
The Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under
netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising
from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2022.
The Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The
Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties
in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of
warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in
natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic
value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.
Southern Company Gas enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its
customers and various markets. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the
locations served by the capacity to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical
flow of natural gas between delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at
fair value on the balance sheets, with changes in fair value included in earnings in the period of change. These contracts are not
designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
The purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as
appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with
the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation
capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements, and these demand charges and payments are recognized on
the statements of income in the period they are incurred. This difference in accounting methods can result in volatility in reported
earnings, even though the economic margin is substantially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.
Comprehensive Income
The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
from transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
net income attributable to the Registrant, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts
included in net income. Comprehensive income also consists of certain changes in pension and other postretirement benefit plans
for Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas.

Variable Interest Entities
The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required
to consolidate the VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE. See Note 7 for additional information regarding VIEs.(*)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Alabama Power
Alabama Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight
of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE,
Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting
Alabama Power.
Certificates of Convenience and Necessity
In 2020, the Alabama PSC issued its order regarding Alabama Power's 2019 petition for a CCN, which authorized Alabama Power
to (i) construct an approximately 720-MW combined cycle facility at Alabama Power's Plant Barry (Plant Barry Unit 8) that is
expected to be placed in service in November 2023, (ii) complete the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station, which
occurred in August 2020, (iii) purchase approximately 240 MWs of combined cycle generation under a long-term PPA, which
began in September 2020, and (iv) pursue up to approximately 200 MWs of cost-effective demand-side management and
distributed energy resource programs. Alabama Power's petition for a CCN was predicated on the results of Alabama Power's 2019
IRP provided to the Alabama PSC, which identified an approximately 2,400-MW resource need for Alabama Power, driven by the
need for additional winter reserve capacity. See Note 15 under "Alabama Power" for additional information on the acquisition of
the Central Alabama Generating Station.
The Alabama PSC authorized the recovery of actual costs for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 up to 5% above the estimated
in-service cost of $652 million. In so doing, it recognized the potential for developments that could cause the project costs to
exceed the capped amount, in which case Alabama Power would provide documentation to the Alabama PSC to explain and justify
potential recovery of the additional costs. At December 31, 2022, project expenditures associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 totaled
approximately $518 million, of which $513 million and $5 million was included in CWIP and property, plant, and equipment in
service, respectively. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 pursuant to its Rate CNP New Plant. The recovery of
costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry are expected to be recovered
through Rate CNP Compliance. Alabama Power expects to recover the capacity-related costs associated with the PPAs through its
Rate CNP PPA. In addition, fuel and energy-related costs are expected to be recovered through Rate ECR. Any remaining costs
associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 are expected to be recovered through Rate RSE.
Through May 2023, Alabama Power expects to recover substantially all costs associated with the Central Alabama Generating
Station through Rate RSE, offset by revenues from a previous power sales agreement. Beginning in July 2022, fuel costs associated
with Central Alabama Generating Station are being recovered through Rate ECR.
On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved a CCN authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun
Generating Station, a 743-MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun County, Alabama. The
acquisition was approved by the FERC on March 25, 2022. The transaction closed on September 30, 2022 and, on October 3, 2022,
Alabama Power filed Rate CNP New Plant with the Alabama PSC to recover the related costs, as described further under "Rate
CNP New Plant" herein. Alabama Power is recovering the remaining costs associated with the Calhoun Generating Station through
its existing rate structure, primarily Rate CNP Compliance, Rate ECR, and Rate RSE.
Renewable Generation Certificate
Alabama Power is authorized by the Alabama PSC to procure up to 500 MWs of renewable capacity and energy by September 16,
2027 and to market the related energy and environmental attributes to customers and other third parties. Through December 31,
2022, Alabama Power has procured solar capacity totaling approximately 330 MWs.
Rate RSE
The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected
weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking
information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together,
cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is
an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting
point if Alabama Power (i) has an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top
one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey.
Alabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances,
thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of
2025. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 52.2% and 51.6%, respectively.
II-139
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Generally, during a year without a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%,
customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of
the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%. During a year
with a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER exceeds 6.15%, customers receive 50% of the amount
between 6.15% and 6.90% and all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 6.90%. Alabama Power's ability to retain a portion of
the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range positions Alabama Power to address the
growing pressure on its credit quality, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. There is no provision for
additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range.
Retail rates under Rate RSE did not change for 2020 or 2022 and increased by 4.09%, or approximately $228 million annually,
effective with the billing month of January 2021.
At December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Alabama Power's WCER exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a
current regulatory liability of $50 million, $181 million, and $62 million, respectively, for Rate RSE refunds. The 2020 refund was
issued to customers through bill credits in April 2021. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022,
Alabama Power applied $126 million of the 2021 refund to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining
$55 million was refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022. See "Rate ECR" herein for additional information. On
February 7, 2023, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to issue the 2022 refund to customers through bill credits in August
2023.
On December 1, 2022, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for
calendar year 2023. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged
for 2023.
Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order
On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to accelerate the amortization of a regulatory liability associated
with excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes, which is being returned to customers through bill credits of up to
approximately $318 million in 2023 to offset the impact of the rate increase discussed under "Rate CNP Depreciation" herein. The
Alabama PSC will determine the treatment of any remaining excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes at a future date. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Rate CNP New Plant
Rate CNP New Plant allows for recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with newly developed or acquired certificated
generating facilities placed into retail service. No adjustments to Rate CNP New Plant occurred during the period January 2020
through October 2022. On October 3, 2022, Alabama Power filed Rate CNP New Plant with the Alabama PSC to recover costs
related to the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. The filing reflected an increase in annual revenues of $34 million, or
0.6%, effective with November 2022 billings. See "Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" herein for additional information.

Rate CNP PPA allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with certificated PPAs. Revenues for Rate CNP
PPA, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama
Power's revenues or net income but will affect annual cash flow. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2020
through 2022 and no adjustment is expected for 2023. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP
PPA balance of $120 million, of which $18 million is included in other regulatory assets, current and $102 million is included in
other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP
PPA balance of $84 million included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet.
Rate CNP Compliance
Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such
mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar
considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information
and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama PSC by December
1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance
expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial
statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly,
changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or
II-140
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and
depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.
In November 2020, November 2021, and December 2022, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of
complying with governmental mandates for the following calendar year, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. Both the 2020
and 2021 filings reflected a projected under recovered retail revenue requirement of approximately $59 million. In December 2020
and 2021, the Alabama PSC issued consent orders that Alabama Power leave the 2020 Rate CNP Compliance factors in effect for
2021 and 2022, respectively, with any prior year under collected amount deemed recovered before any current year amounts are
recovered, and any remaining under recovery reflected in the 2022 filing. The 2022 filing reflected a $255 million, or 3.7%, annual
increase effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated depreciation rates.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $47 million and $16
million, respectively, included in other regulatory assets, current and other regulatory assets, deferred, respectively, on the balance
sheet.
Rate CNP Depreciation
On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in
depreciation resulting from updates to certain depreciation rates, excluding any depreciation recovered through Rate CNP New
Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, or costs associated with the capitalization of asset retirement costs. Rate CNP Depreciation will result
in an annual revenue increase of approximately $318 million, or 4.6%, effective with January 2023 billings. See "Excess
Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order" herein for information related to 2023 customer bill credits approved by the
Alabama PSC.
Rate ECR
Rate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under
recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in
actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts
billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the
Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is
required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but
will impact the related operating cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per
KWH.
In 2020, Alabama Power reduced its over-collected fuel balance by $94 million in accordance with an Alabama PSC order and
returned that amount to customers in the form of bill credits.
Also in 2020, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 2.160 cents per KWH to 1.960 cents per KWH, equal to
1.84%, or approximately $103 million annually, that became effective with January 2021 billings and remained in effect through
July 2022 billings.
The Alabama PSC approved adjustments to Rate ECR from 1.960 cents per KWH to 2.557 cents per KWH, or approximately
$310 million annually, effective with August 2022 billings and from 2.557 cents per KWH to 3.510 cents per KWH, or
approximately $500 million annually, effective with December 2022 billings. The rate will adjust to 5.910 cents per KWH in
January 2025 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC.
In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power applied $126 million of its 2021 Rate RSE
refund to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance. See "Rate RSE" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2022,
Alabama Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled $622 million, of which $102 million is included in other regulatory assets,
current and $520 million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, Alabama
Power's under recovered fuel costs totaled $126 million and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet.
These classifications are based on estimates, which include such factors as weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the
price of energy. A change in any of these factors could have a significant impact on the timing of any recovery or return of fuel
costs.
Software Accounting Order
The Alabama PSC authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for operations and maintenance costs associated with
software implementation projects. The regulatory asset is amortized ratably over the life of the related software. At December 31,
2022 and 2021, the regulatory asset balance totaled $46 million and $35 million, respectively, and is included in other regulatory
assets, deferred on the balance sheet.

Plant Greene County
Alabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership
Agreements" for additional information. In September 2021, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the conclusion of its
review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP with no deficiencies identified. Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire
Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 in December 2025 and 2026, respectively,
consistent with each unit's remaining useful life. The Plant Greene County unit retirements identified by Mississippi Power require
the completion of transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will
continue to monitor the status of the transmission and system reliability improvements. Currently, Alabama Power plans to retire
Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 at the dates indicated. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Rate NDR
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover
the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate
NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve
balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below $50 million, a reserve
establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve
balance reaches $75 million.
The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and
maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a 48-month period (24-month period prior to modifications approved by the
Alabama PSC on July 12, 2022). The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR
when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. The maximum total Rate NDR charge was limited to $10.00
per month per non-residential customer account and $5.00 per month per residential customer account through July 12, 2022.
Subsequently, modifications approved by the Alabama PSC replaced the maximum total Rate NDR charge with a maximum charge
to recover a deficit of $5 per month per non-residential customer account and $2.50 per month per residential customer account.
Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances
warrant, which can be used to offset storm charges. Alabama Power made additional accruals of $65 million and $100 million in
2021 and 2020, respectively.
Alabama Power collected approximately $14 million, $6 million, and $5 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, under Rate
NDR. Beginning with August 2022 billings, the reserve establishment charge was suspended and the reserve maintenance charge
was activated as a result of the NDR balance exceeding $75 million. Alabama Power expects to collect approximately $12 million
annually under Rate NDR unless the NDR balance falls below $50 million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the NDR balance was
$97 million and $103 million, respectively, and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheets.
As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR
will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash
flows.
Reliability Reserve Accounting Order
On July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Alabama Power to create a reliability reserve
separate from the NDR and transition the previous Rate NDR authority related to reliability expenditures to the reliability reserve.
Alabama Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve if the NDR balance exceeds $35 million. At December 31, 2022,
Alabama Power accrued $166 million to the reserve, which is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.
Environmental Accounting Order
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is authorized to establish a
regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered
costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The
regulatory asset is amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision
regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance.
With the completion of the Calhoun Generating Station acquisition, Alabama Power expects to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 in late
2023 or early 2024, subject to certain operating conditions. In September 2022, Alabama Power reclassified approximately
$600 million for Plant Barry Unit 5 from plant in service, net of depreciation to other utility plant, net and will continue to
II-142
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
depreciate the asset according to the original depreciation rates. At retirement, Alabama Power will reclassify the remaining net
investment costs of the unit to a regulatory asset to be recovered over the unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the
decision to retire, through Rate CNP Compliance. See "Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" herein for additional
information.
On December 5, 2022, in conjunction with Alabama Power's compliance plan for the EPA's final steam electric ELG
reconsideration rule, Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased using coal and began operating solely on natural gas. As a result, approximately
$42 million of plant in service, net of depreciation was reclassified to a regulatory asset to be recovered through Rate CNP
Compliance through 2034, the unit's remaining useful life.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of
the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through traditional base tariffs, Demand-Side
Management (DSM) tariffs, the ECCR tariff, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. These tariffs were set under the 2019 ARP
for the years 2020 through 2022 and under the 2022 ARP for the years 2023 through 2025 as described herein. In addition,
financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel
costs are collected through a fuel cost recovery tariff, both under separate regulatory proceedings.
See "Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding" herein for information regarding the approved recovery through
retail base rates of certain costs related to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the common facilities shared between Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
(Common Facilities) that will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. As costs are included in retail base rates,
the related financing costs will no longer be recovered through the NCCR tariff. See "Nuclear Construction" herein for additional
information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Rate Plans
2022 ARP
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2022 ARP, under which Georgia Power increased its rates on
January 1, 2023 and will increase rates annually for 2024 and 2025 as detailed below, with the incremental revenue requirements
related to DSM tariffs and CCR AROs subject to updates through annual compliance filings to be made at least 90 days prior to the
effective date. Georgia Power will recover estimated adjustments through its existing tariffs as follows:
Tariff 2023 2024 2025
(in millions)
Traditional base $ 194 $ 275 $ 315 
ECCR (21) 66 81 
DSM 37 27 (2)
MFF 6 9 9 
Total $ 216 $ 377 $ 403 
In the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery through the ECCR tariff of estimated CCR ARO compliance costs for 2023,
2024, and 2025 over four-year periods beginning January 1 of each respective year, with recovery of construction contingency
beginning in the year following actual expenditures, resulting in an estimated $20 million reduction in the related amortization
expense for 2023. The estimated compliance costs expected to be incurred in 2023, 2024, and 2025 are $320 million, $410 million,
and $510 million, respectively. The CCR ARO costs are expected to be revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates
through future annual compliance filings. See "Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information.
Further, under the 2022 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.50% and its equity ratio is set at 56%. Earnings will be
evaluated against a retail ROE range of 9.50% to 11.90%. Any retail earnings above 11.90% will be shared, with 40% being applied
to reduce regulatory assets, 40% directly refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. There will be
no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 9.50% on an actual basis. However, if at any time during the term of the 2022 ARP,
Georgia Power projects that its retail earnings will be below 9.50% for any calendar year, it may petition the Georgia PSC for
implementation of the Interim Cost Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Power's retail rates to achieve a 9.50% ROE. The
Georgia PSC would have 90 days to rule on Georgia Power's request. The ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2026
or the end of the calendar year in which the ICR tariff becomes effective. In lieu of requesting implementation of an ICR tariff, or if
the Georgia PSC chooses not to implement the ICR tariff, Georgia Power may file a full rate case.
II-143

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Except as provided above, Georgia Power will not file for a general base rate increase while the 2022 ARP is in effect. Georgia
Power is required to file a general base rate case by July 1, 2025, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to
determine whether the 2022 ARP should be continued, modified, or discontinued.
2019 ARP
The Georgia PSC approved the following tariff adjustments under the 2019 ARP effective January 1, 2021 and 2022, respectively:
Tariff 2021 2022
(in millions)
Traditional base $ 120 $ 192 
ECCR 2 (12)
DSM (15) (25)
MFF 4 2 
Total $ 111 $ 157 
In the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery through the ECCR tariff of the estimated under recovered balance of CCR
ARO compliance costs. Under the 2019 ARP, the under recovered balance at December 31, 2019 and compliance costs for 2020
were recovered over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Recovery of estimated compliance costs for 2021 and 2022
are being recovered over four-year periods beginning January 1 of each respective year, as authorized under the 2019 ARP and
modified under the 2022 ARP, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditure. The
CCR ARO costs recovered through the ECCR tariff are revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through annual
compliance filings, which resulted in an approximate $90 million decrease and $10 million increase effective January 1, 2021 and
2022, respectively, in the related cost recovery. See "Integrated Resource Plans" herein for additional information.
Georgia Power's retail ROE under the 2019 ARP was set at 10.50% and earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of
9.50% to 12.00%. Any retail earnings above 12.00% were shared, with 40% applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40% directly
refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. In 2020, Georgia Power's retail ROE was within the
allowed retail ROE range. In 2021, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by
approximately $5 million and accrued approximately $5 million which was refunded to customers in 2022. In 2022, Georgia
Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by approximately $119 million and accrued
approximately $119 million, which is expected to be refunded to customers through bill credits later in the first quarter 2023, prior
to review and approval by the Georgia PSC, in accordance with the 2022 ARP.
Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding
In accordance with a Georgia PSC order approved in November 2021, Georgia Power will include in rate base an allocation of
$2.1 billion to Unit 3 and Common Facilities from the $3.6 billion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 previously deemed prudent by the
Georgia PSC and will recover the related depreciation expense through retail base rates effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in
service. Financing costs on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the Common Facilities construction costs will continue to
be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power will defer as a regulatory asset the remaining depreciation
expense (approximately $40 million annually) until Unit 4 costs are placed in retail base rates. In addition, the stipulated agreement
clarified that following the prudency review, the remaining amount to be placed in retail base rates will be net of the proceeds from
the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and will not be used to offset imprudent costs, if any.
The related increase in annual retail base rates of approximately $302 million also includes recovery of all projected operations and
maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related
production tax credits, and will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. As approved by the Georgia PSC, the
increase in annual retail base rates will be adjusted based on the actual in-service date of Plant Vogtle Unit 3.
See "Nuclear Construction" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Integrated Resource Plans
In 2021, as authorized in its 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested and received certification from the Georgia PSC for 970 MWs of
utility-scale PPAs for solar generation resources. In response to supply chain challenges in the solar industry, the Georgia PSC
approved a request by Georgia Power to extend the required commercial operation dates for the PPAs from 2023 to 2024.
II-144
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On July 21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial IRP (2022 IRP), as modified by a stipulated agreement
among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. In the
2022 IRP decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following:
•Decertification and retirement of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), which occurred on
August 31, 2022, and reclassification to regulatory asset accounts of the remaining net book values and any remaining
unusable materials and supplies inventories upon retirement. The regulatory asset accounts for the remaining net book
values of the units ($292 million and $270 million for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively, at December 31, 2022) were
amortized at a rate equal to the unit depreciation rates authorized in the 2019 ARP through December 31, 2022. Under the
2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery of the remaining regulatory asset balances for the net book values of the
units through 2030 and deferred a decision on the timing of recovery of the regulatory asset account for the unusable
materials and supplies inventories ($13 million at December 31, 2022) to a future base rate case.
•Decertification and retirement of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) by December 31, 2028 and
reclassification to regulatory asset accounts of the remaining net book value (approximately $601 million at December 31,
2022). Under the 2022 ARP, $43 million annually of the related depreciation is being deferred to a regulatory asset, which
will be amortized over six years beginning in 2029. Any remaining unusable materials and supplies inventory will be
reclassified to regulatory asset accounts upon retirement, with the timing of recovery to be determined in a future base rate
case.
•Decertification and retirement of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) by
December 31, 2028. See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for additional information.
•Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy, including approval of Georgia Power's plans to address CCR at its
ash ponds and landfills. Recovery of the related costs incurred beyond 2025 is expected to be determined in future base
rate cases. The Georgia PSC's approval of the 2022 IRP included a change in the method of closure for one ash pond. See
"Rate Plans" herein and Note 6 for additional information.
•Installation of environmental controls at Plants Bowen and Scherer for compliance with rules related to effluent limitations
guidelines.
•Initiation of a license renewal application with the NRC for Plant Hatch.
•Investments related to the continued hydro operations of Plants Sinclair and Burton.
•Provisional authorization for development of a 265-MW battery energy storage facility with expected commercial
operation in 2026.
•Issuance of requests for proposals (RFP) for 2,300 MWs of renewable resources, an additional 500 MWs of energy
storage, and up to 140 MWs of biomass generation.
•Related transmission projects necessary to support the generation facilities plan.
•Certification of six PPAs (including five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power that are subject to approval by the FERC)
with capacities of 1,567 MWs beginning in 2024, 380 MWs beginning in 2025, and 228 MWs beginning in 2028,
procured through RFPs authorized in the 2019 IRP. See Note 9 for additional information.
The Georgia PSC deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) to
the 2025 IRP. Under the 2022 ARP, $40 million annually of the related depreciation is being deferred to a regulatory asset, which
will be amortized over four years beginning in 2031. The Georgia PSC rejected Georgia Power's request to certify approximately
88 MWs of wholesale capacity to be placed in retail rate base between January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025. Georgia Power may
offer such capacity in the wholesale market or to the retail jurisdiction in a future regulatory proceeding.
On August 26, 2022, Restore Chattooga Gorge Coalition (RCG) filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia
against Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC. The petition challenges Georgia Power's plan to expend $115 million to modernize
Plant Tugalo, as approved in the 2019 IRP, and seeks judicial review of the Georgia PSC's order in the 2022 IRP proceeding with
respect to the denial of RCG's challenge to the modernization plan. On November 7, 2022, Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC
both filed motions to dismiss the RCG petition.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs
During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Georgia Power to defer as a
regulatory asset the incremental bad debt resulting from the approved suspension of customer disconnections during certain periods
in 2020. The Georgia PSC approved orders establishing a methodology for identifying incremental bad debt and allowing the
deferral of other incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the incremental
II-145
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
costs deferred totaled approximately $25 million and $21 million, respectively. In the 2022 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved a
three-year recovery period ending December 31, 2025.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In 2020, the Georgia PSC approved a
stipulation agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors to lower total fuel billings by
approximately $740 million over a two-year period effective June 1, 2020. In addition, Georgia Power further lowered fuel billings
by approximately $44 million under an interim fuel rider effective June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During the second
half of 2021, the price of natural gas rose significantly and resulted in an under recovered fuel balance exceeding $200 million.
Therefore, in November 2021, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's interim fuel rider, which increased fuel rates by
15%, or approximately $252 million annually, effective January 1, 2022. During 2022, Georgia Power's under recovered fuel
balance continued to increase significantly due to higher fuel and purchased power costs. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its
next fuel case no later than February 28, 2023.
Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled $2.1 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
and is included in deferred under recovered fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets.
Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and
approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 36-month time horizon.
Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and
amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern
Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.
Storm Damage Recovery
Georgia Power defers and recovers certain costs related to damages from major storms as mandated by the Georgia PSC. During
2020 through 2022, Georgia Power recovered $213 million annually under the 2019 ARP. Effective January 1, 2023, Georgia
Power is recovering $31 million annually under the 2022 ARP. At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power's storm damage reserve
balance was $83 million and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on Southern Company's balance sheets and other
deferred credits and liabilities on Georgia Power's balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power's regulatory asset balance
related to storm damage was $48 million and is included in other regulatory assets, current on Southern Company's and Georgia
Power's balance sheets. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as
necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to have a material impact on Southern
Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements. See Note 1 under "Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves" for additional
information.
Nuclear Construction
In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, in which Georgia Power currently holds a 45.7%
ownership interest. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full
construction of the two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related
facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement,
which was a substantially fixed price agreement.
In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing in March 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the
other Vogtle Owners, entered into several transitional arrangements to allow construction to continue. In July 2017, Georgia Power,
acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement, whereby Westinghouse
provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and
materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the
Vogtle Owners upon 30 days' written notice.
In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, under
which Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's
performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based
on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the
Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to
work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at
certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under

certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the
Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events.

Guarantee Agreement, including applicable covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events.
Cost and Schedule
Georgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4,
including contingency, through the end of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024, respectively, is as follows:
(in millions)
Base project capital cost forecast $ 10,533 
Construction contingency estimate 60 
Total project capital cost forecast 10,593 
Net investment at December 31, 2022 (9,521)
Remaining estimate to complete $ 1,072 
(a)Includes approximately $610 million of costs that are not shared with the other Vogtle Owners, including $33 million of construction monitoring costs approved
for recovery by the Georgia PSC in its nineteenth VCM order, and approximately $407 million of incremental costs under the cost-sharing and tender provisions
of the joint ownership agreements described below. Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $421 million, of
which $304 million had been accrued through December 31, 2022.
(b)Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds.
Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $3.5 billion,
of which $3.2 billion had been incurred through December 31, 2022.
As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to
incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of start-up testing and related test results, engineering support,
commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics. Southern Nuclear establishes aggressive target values for
monthly construction production and system turnover activities, which are reflected in the site work plans.
Since March 2020, the number of active COVID-19 cases at the site has fluctuated consistent with the surrounding area and
impacted productivity levels and pace of activity completion, with the site experiencing peaks in the number of active cases in
January 2021, August 2021, and January 2022. Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have
consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plans. As of December 31,
2022, Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental cost associated with COVID-19 mitigation actions and
impacts on construction productivity is estimated to be between $160 million and $200 million and is included in the total project
capital cost forecast. Future COVID-19 variants could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities.
On July 29, 2022, Southern Nuclear announced that all Unit 3 ITAACs had been submitted to the NRC. On August 3, 2022, the
NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the combined license for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed
nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. Fuel load for Unit 3 was completed on October 17, 2022. In early 2023,
during the start-up and pre-operational testing for Unit 3, Southern Nuclear identified and is remediating certain equipment and
component issues. As a result, Unit 3 is projected to be placed in service during May or June 2023. After considering the timeframe
and duration of hot functional and other testing and recent experience with Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing, Unit 4 is now
projected to be placed in service during late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024.
During 2022, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $307 million were assigned to the base capital cost
forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, additional
craft and support resources, procurement for Units 3 and 4, and the equipment and component issues identified during Unit 3 start-
up and pre-operational testing. During 2022, Georgia Power also increased its total project capital cost forecast by $125 million to
replenish construction contingency and $9 million for construction monitoring costs, which were approved for recovery by the
Georgia PSC in its nineteenth VCM order.
After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate
outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in
future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter
2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of $36 million ($27 million after tax), $32 million ($24 million after tax), and $148 million ($110
million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia
PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the
twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described below.(a)(b)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up,
which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4
primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning;
maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining
appropriate levels of craft laborers. As Unit 4 completes construction and transitions further into testing, ongoing and potential
future challenges include the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing; the pace and quality of remaining
commodities installation; completion of documentation to support ITAAC submittals; the pace of remaining work package closures
and system turnovers; and the availability of craft, supervisory, and technical support resources. Ongoing or future challenges for
both units also include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; and/or related cost escalation. New
challenges also may continue to arise, as Unit 3 completes start-up and commissioning and Unit 4 moves further into testing and
start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some
of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at
this scale). These challenges may result in further schedule delays and/or cost increases.
There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal
and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the
requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses,
including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. With the receipt of the NRC's 103(g)
finding, Unit 3 is now subject to the NRC's operating reactor oversight process and must meet applicable technical and operational
requirements contained in its operating license. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely
submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to
support NRC authorization to load fuel for Unit 4, may arise, which may result in additional license amendment requests or require
other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs
for Unit 4, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the
second quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the first quarter 2024 for Unit 4, including the joint owner cost sharing and tender impacts
described below, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $15 million per month for Unit 3
and $35 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or
testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other
than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below, management
will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to
be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.
Joint Owner Contracts
In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective in August 2018, the Vogtle
Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint
ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle
Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against
Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners
is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.
Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements
In connection with a September 2018 vote by the Vogtle Owners to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding
term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power
SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take
certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments
to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and
(ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide up to $300 million of funding with respect
to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. In January 2019, Georgia Power,
MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February
2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and
MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the
Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Pursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4, of which Georgia Power's share is $8.4 billion (VCM 19 Forecast Amount), plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be
responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the VCM 19 Forecast
Amount (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for
44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for
65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the VCM 19 Forecast Amount (resulting in a
further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of
such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. The Global Amendments provide that if the EAC is
revised and exceeds the VCM 19 Forecast Amount by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time
option at the time the project budget cost forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in
exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess
of the VCM 19 Forecast Amount plus $2.1 billion.
For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure
events, including epidemics and quarantines, governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of
such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative
proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to
litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs
caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the
Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by $100,000 or more.
In addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) occur, including, among other events: (i) the
bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services
Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of
its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC
determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in
retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global
Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the
Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental
extension of one year or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022
for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The schedule extension announced in February 2022 triggered the requirement for a vote to
continue construction. Effective February 25, 2022, all of the Vogtle Owners had voted to continue construction.
Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases
subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact
those provisions. The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by
the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton,
respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these
purported tender exercises.
On June 18, 2022, OPC and MEAG Power each filed a separate lawsuit against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton
County, Georgia seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is $17.1 billion and that the cost-sharing and tender
provisions have been triggered. The lawsuits also assert other claims, including breach of contract allegations, and seek, among
other remedies, damages and injunctive relief requiring Georgia Power to track and allocate construction costs consistent with
MEAG Power's and OPC's interpretations of the Global Amendments. On July 25, 2022 and July 28, 2022, Georgia Power filed its
answers in the lawsuits filed by MEAG Power and OPC, respectively, and included counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment
that the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and that costs related to force majeure events are excluded prior to calculating the
cost-sharing and tender provisions and when calculating Georgia Power's related financial obligations. On September 26, 2022,
Dalton filed complaints in each of these lawsuits. On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement
to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments.
Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full
ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of
construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which
payments will total approximately $92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will
reimburse 20% of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast,
with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. In addition, MEAG Power agreed to vote to continue
II-149
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
construction upon occurrence of a Project Adverse Event unless the commercial operation date of either of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 or
Unit 4 is not projected to occur by December 31, 2025. On October 4, 2022, MEAG Power and Georgia Power filed a notice of
settlement and voluntary dismissal of their pending litigation, including Georgia Power's counterclaim, and, on October 6, 2022,
Dalton dismissed its related complaint.
Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges (credits) to income in the fourth quarter 2021, the second quarter 2022, the third quarter
2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax), $16 million ($12 million after tax),
$(102) million ($(76) million after tax), and $53 million ($40 million after tax), respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and
tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of $407 million associated with
these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement
with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, described
above. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $345 million associated
with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments for OPC and Dalton based on the current project capital cost
forecast.
Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in
the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees
with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia
Power to pay 100% of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia
Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are
placed in service.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Regulatory Matters
In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of $4.418 billion.
In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and
the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR
tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power had recovered approximately $2.9
billion of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion are being recognized through AFUDC and
are expected to be recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; however, Georgia Power is not
recording AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently $7.3 billion)
and not requested for rate recovery. On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's filing to increase the
NCCR tariff by $36 million annually, effective January 1, 2023.
Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In
2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of
the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009
certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia
Power.
In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency
matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related
order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The
Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth
VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was
reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed
from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable
and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that
any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact
of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related customer refunds) was found reasonable; (iv)
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as
primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in
service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost
cap and that a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur following Unit 4 fuel load, consistent with applicable Georgia law;
(vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia
PSC at that time) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from 10.00% to
II-150
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from 8.30% to 5.30%, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be
less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that effective the
first month after Unit 3 reaches commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include the costs related to Unit 3 and
common facilities deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement (see "Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate
Proceeding" herein for additional information). The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not
commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further
reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective
Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $300 million, $270 million,
and $150 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $270
million in 2023 and $60 million in 2024. In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and
assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right
to reconsider the decision to continue construction.
In the August 2021 order approving the twenty-fourth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation addressing the
following matters: (i) beginning with its twenty-fifth VCM report, Georgia Power will continue to report to the Georgia PSC all
costs incurred during the period for review and will request for approval costs up to the $7.3 billion determined to be reasonable in
the Georgia PSC's seventeenth VCM order and (ii) Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery of the $0.7 billion increase to the
base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter
2018. In addition, the stipulation confirms Georgia Power may request verification and approval of costs above $7.3 billion for
inclusion in rate base at a later time, but no earlier than the prudence review contemplated by the seventeenth VCM order described
previously.
The Georgia PSC has approved 25 VCM reports covering periods through June 30, 2021. These reports reflect total construction
capital costs incurred of $7.9 billion (net of $1.7 billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and
approximately $188 million in related customer refunds), of which the Georgia PSC has verified and approved $7.3 billion as
described above. The Georgia PSC also has reviewed two additional VCM reports, which reflected $1.1 billion of additional
construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2022. Georgia Power expects to file its twenty-eighth VCM report with the
Georgia PSC on February 16, 2023, which will reflect the revised capital cost forecast described above and $461 million of
construction capital costs incurred from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC.
Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs.
These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the
costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses
are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates.
2019 Base Rate Case
In 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff
related to Mississippi Power's base rate case filed in 2019 (Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement).
Under the terms of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement, annual retail rates decreased approximately
$16.7 million, or 1.85%, effective for the first billing cycle of April 2020, based on a test year period of January 1, 2020 through
December 31, 2020, a 53% average equity ratio, an allowed maximum actual equity ratio of 55% by the end of 2020, and a 7.57%
return on investment.
Additionally, the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement: (i) established common amortization periods of four years
for regulatory assets and three years for regulatory liabilities included in the approved revenue requirement, including those related
to unprotected deferred income taxes; (ii) established new depreciation rates reflecting an annual increase in depreciation of
approximately $10 million; and (iii) excluded certain compensation costs totaling approximately $3.9 million. It also eliminated
separate rates for costs associated with Plant Ratcliffe and energy efficiency initiatives and includes such costs in the PEP, ECO
Plan, and ad valorem tax adjustment factor, as applicable.
Performance Evaluation Plan
Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. In recognition
that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, PEP includes
II-151
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi
Power's performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to
prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric
service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Typically, two PEP filings are made
for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing in March of the current year and the PEP lookback filing in March of the
subsequent year. The annual PEP projected filings utilize a historic test year adjusted for "known and measurable" changes and
discounted cash flow and regression formulas to determine base ROE. The PEP lookback filing reflects the actual revenue
requirement.
Pursuant to a Mississippi PSC-approved settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the MPUS, Mississippi Power was
not required to make any PEP filings for the regulatory year 2020.
In June 2021 and June 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filings, resulting in annual
increases in revenues of approximately $16 million, or 1.8%, and $18 million, or 1.9%, respectively, effective with the first billing
cycle of April 2021 and April 2022, respectively.
Integrated Resource Plan
In 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or
anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve
margin. The order stated that Mississippi Power will be allowed to defer any retirement-related costs as regulatory assets for future
recovery.
In September 2021, the Mississippi PSC concluded its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP. The 2021 IRP included a schedule
to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2
(103 MWs each) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026, respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most
recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the schedule reflects the early retirement of Mississippi Power's 50% undivided
ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs) by the end of 2027. The Plant Greene County unit retirements require
the completion by Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power.
Mississippi Power is scheduled to file its next IRP in April 2024.
The remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately $499 million at December 31, 2022 and Mississippi
Power is continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates through the end of 2027. Mississippi Power expects
to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement, which is expected to total approximately $397 million, to a regulatory asset
to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future proceedings, consistent with the 2020 order. The
Plant Watson and Greene County units are expected to be fully depreciated upon retirement. The ultimate outcome of these matters
cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under "Other Matters – Mississippi Power" for additional information on Plant
Daniel Units 1 and 2.
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan
In accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory
asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations.
In June 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2021, resulting in a decrease in revenues of
approximately $9 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of July 2021.
On April 5, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2022, resulting in an increase in revenues
of approximately $1 million annually. The rate increase became effective with the first billing cycle of May 2022.
On February 14, 2023, Mississippi Power submitted its ECO Plan filing for 2023 indicating no change in retail rates. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Mississippi Power annually establishes, and is required to file for an adjustment to, the retail fuel cost recovery factor that is
approved by the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC approved a decrease of $24 million effective in February 2020 and
increases of $2 million and $43 million effective in February 2021 and 2022, respectively. On November 15, 2022, Mississippi
Power filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to increase retail fuel revenues by $25 million annually effective with the first
billing cycle of February 2023 and an additional $25 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of June 2023. On January
10, 2023, the Mississippi PSC voted to defer approval of the filing. Mississippi Power is allowed to maintain current

billing rates and continue accruing its weighted-average cost of capital on any under or over fuel recovery balance. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, under recovered retail fuel costs totaled approximately $1 million and $4 million, respectively,
and were included in other customer accounts receivable on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's balance sheets.
Mississippi Power has wholesale MRA and Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factors. Effective with the first billing cycles for
January 2021, 2022, and 2023, annual revenues under the wholesale MRA fuel rate decreased $5 million, increased $11 million,
and increased $22 million, respectively. The wholesale MB fuel rate did not change materially in any period presented. At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, under recovered wholesale fuel costs were $6 million and $1 million, respectively.
Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance
with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on
Mississippi Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.
Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment
Mississippi Power annually establishes an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. Effective with
the first billing cycle of April 2020, May 2021, and July 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved increases in annual revenues collected
through the ad valorem tax adjustment factor of $10 million, $28 million, and $5 million, respectively. The 2021 increase included
approximately $19 million of ad valorem taxes previously recovered through PEP in accordance with the Mississippi Power Rate
Case Settlement Agreement.
System Restoration Rider
Mississippi Power carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and general property. However,
Mississippi Power is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured casualty damage to its property, including
transmission and distribution facilities. As permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, Mississippi Power accrues for the cost
of such damage through an annual expense accrual which is credited to regulatory liability accounts for the retail and wholesale
jurisdictions. The cost of repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed $50,000 is charged to the
reserve. Every year, the Mississippi PSC, the MPUS, and Mississippi Power agree on SRR revenue level(s).
Mississippi Power's net retail SRR accrual, which includes carrying costs and amortization of related excess deferred income tax
benefits, was $6.9 million in 2022, $(1.8) million in 2021, and $0.8 million in 2020. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the retail
property damage reserve balance was $37 million and $31 million, respectively.
In December 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which requested an increase in retail
revenues of approximately $9 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of March 2022. The Mississippi PSC also
established $8 million as the minimum annual accrual amount until a target property damage reserve balance of $75 million is met.
In the event the expected annual charges exceed the annual accrual or the target balance has been met, Mississippi Power and the
Mississippi PSC will determine the appropriate change to the annual accrual. Additionally, if PEP earnings are above a certain
threshold, Mississippi Power has the ability to apply any required PEP refund as an additional accrual to the property damage
reserve in lieu of customer refunds.
On February 14, 2023, Mississippi Power submitted its annual SRR filing to the Mississippi PSC, which indicated no change in
retail rates. The filing includes a request to increase the minimum annual accrual from $8 million to $12 million. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Reliability Reserve Accounting Order
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to create a reliability
reserve for the purpose of deferring generation, transmission, and distribution reliability-related expenditures for use in a future
year. Mississippi Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve each year after meeting with the MPUS and Mississippi PSC
staff. Mississippi Power will provide annually, through its capital plan, energy delivery plan, or PEP filing, any amounts to be
charged against the reliability reserve during the current year. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power accrued $25 million to the
reliability reserve.
Software Accounting Order
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to establish a regulatory
asset for certain operations and maintenance expenditures related to major technology projects. The recovery period for this
regulatory asset will be determined in Mississippi Power's annual PEP filing process. Mississippi Power will begin deferring these
costs in 2023.

Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff
Mississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the
City of Collins, all located in southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term, cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff.
In 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed, and the FERC accepted, a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part
of the MRA tariff, under which Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy share in providing electricity to the Cooperative Energy
delivery points under the tariff. On August 26, 2022, the FERC accepted an amended SSA between Mississippi Power and
Cooperative Energy, effective July 1, 2022, under which Cooperative Energy will continue to decrease its use of Mississippi
Power's generation services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually through 2035. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power is
serving approximately 400 MWs of Cooperative Energy's annual demand. Beginning in 2036, Cooperative Energy will provide
100% of its electricity requirements at the MRA delivery points under the tariff. Neither party has the option to cancel the amended
SSA.
On July 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for a $23 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues
under the MRA tariff. Cooperative Energy filed a complaint with the FERC challenging the new rates. On September 13, 2022, the
FERC issued an order that accepted Mississippi Power's request effective September 14, 2022, subject to refund, and established
hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Company Gas
Utility Regulation and Rate Design
The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates
charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies
approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on
rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based
primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed
charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta
Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer
consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer
demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas
has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit
exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility,
allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation,
energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer
service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception of
Chattanooga Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes
encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by
customers. See "Rate Proceedings" herein for additional information. Also see "Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital
Projects" herein for additional information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural gas distribution
utilities.

(f)Regulatory mechanism allowing annual adjustments to base rates up or down based on authorized ROE and/or ROE range.
Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects
In addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and
Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure
replacement programs. Total capital expenditures incurred during 2022 for gas distribution operations were $1.5 billion.
The following table and discussions provide updates on the infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects at the natural
gas distribution utilities at December 31, 2022. These programs are risk-based and designed to update and replace cast iron, bare
steel, and mid-vintage plastic materials or expand Southern Company Gas' distribution systems to improve reliability and meet
operational flexibility and growth.

Commission's approval of Nicor Gas' rate case in November 2021 included recovery of program costs through December 31, 2021.
See "Rate Proceedings – Nicor Gas" herein for additional information. Nicor Gas' capital expenditures related to qualifying projects
under the Investing in Illinois program totaled $408 million and $389 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Virginia Natural Gas
The Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE) program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program, allows Virginia
Natural Gas to continue replacing aging pipeline infrastructure through 2024. The program includes authorized annual investments
of $50 million in 2020, $60 million in 2021, and $70 million in each year from 2022 through 2024, with a total potential variance
of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a maximum total investment over the six-year term (2019 through 2024) of $365
million. Virginia Natural Gas' capital expenditures under the SAVE program totaled $51 million and $49 million in 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In accordance with the base rate case approved by the
Virginia Commission in 2021, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to November 1, 2020 through base
rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to November 1, 2020 are currently being recovered through a separate rider and are
subject to future base rate case proceedings.
Atlanta Gas Light
In 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the continuation of GRAM as part of Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order. Various
infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program
to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system
and LNG facilities in Georgia, continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments are
included in annual base rate adjustments. The amounts to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs have
been recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. These allowed costs are
primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the infrastructure programs in place prior to GRAM and are being
recovered through GRAM and base rates until the earlier of the full recovery of the related under recovered amount or December
31, 2025. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2022 was $68 million, including $35 million of unrecognized equity
return. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See "Unrecognized Ratemaking
Amounts" herein for additional information.
Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to
extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in
Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by
the Georgia PSC.
See "Rate Proceedings – Atlanta Gas Light" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 2021
approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new
System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to
recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024, of which $76 million was incurred in
2022.
Chattanooga Gas
In June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace
approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million,
which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.
Natural Gas Cost Recovery
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in
the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost
of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas
distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue
earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through
adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are
reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern
Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use
customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural
gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At
December 31, 2022, the under recovered balance was $108 million, which was included in natural gas cost
II-156

under recovery on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered
balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was
included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.
Rate Proceedings
Nicor Gas
In November 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The
base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was
based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.
On January 3, 2023, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $321 million increase in
annual base rate revenues, including $59 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program
through December 31, 2023. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending December 31,
2024, a return on equity of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.5%. Further, Nicor Gas is seeking to recover an additional $32 million
under three proposed riders related to recovery of vehicle fuel costs, company use gas, and customer payment fees. The Illinois
Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments
will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Atlanta Gas Light
The Georgia PSC evaluates Atlanta Gas Light's earnings against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any
earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC allows inclusion in base rates of the
recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments. GRAM filing
rate adjustments are based on an authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates.
The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.
In 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of
$37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation
established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021.
In February 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a
long-range comprehensive planning process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light was required to develop and file
at least triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each i-CDP will include a 10-year forecast of interstate and
intrastate capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the first three years consistent with Atlanta Gas Light's current
capacity supply plan, and a 10-year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the
related revenue requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for
authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects.
In April 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first i-CDP with the Georgia PSC, which included a series of ongoing and proposed
pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next 10 years (2022 through 2031), as well as the required capital
investments and related costs to implement the programs. The i-CDP reflected capital investments totaling approximately
$0.5 billion to $0.6 billion annually.
In November 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia
PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System
Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, which resulted in a reduction of $5 million
for 2022 and $7 million for 2023. The stipulation agreement also provided for $1.7 billion of total capital investment for the years
2022 through 2024.
Also in November 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual
rate increase of $43 million effective January 1, 2022.
On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate
increase of $53 million effective January 1, 2023.

Virginia Natural Gas
In September 2021, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation agreement related to Virginia Natural Gas' 2020 general rate
case filing, which allowed for a $43 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $14 million related to the recovery of
investments under the SAVE program, based on a ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 51.9%. Interim rate adjustments became
effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an increase of
approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were
completed during the fourth quarter 2021.
On August 1, 2022, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual
base rate revenues of $69 million, including $15 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily
to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure, technology, and workforce development. The requested
increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2023, a ROE of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 53.2%. Rate
adjustments became effective January 1, 2023, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to rule on the requested
increase in the third quarter 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts
The following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance

Alabama Power
On September 26, 2022, Mobile Baykeeper, through its counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, filed a citizen suit in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Alabama alleging that Alabama Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond utilizing a
closure-in-place methodology violates the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and regulations governing CCR.
Among other relief requested, Mobile Baykeeper seeks a declaratory judgment that the RCRA and regulations governing CCR are
being violated, preliminary and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of Alabama Power's closure plan and the development
of a closure plan that satisfies regulations governing CCR requirements. On January 31, 2023, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential
Violations associated with Alabama Power's plan to close the Plant Barry ash pond. Alabama Power expects to respond by March 2,
2023, subject to any extension agreed upon by the parties. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time
but could have an impact on Alabama Power's ARO estimates. See Note 6 for a discussion of Alabama Power's ARO liabilities.
Georgia Power
Municipal Franchise Fees
In 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative class action against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia alleging that
Georgia Power's collection in rates of amounts for municipal franchise fees (which fees are paid to municipalities) exceeded the
amounts allowed in orders of the Georgia PSC and alleging certain state law claims. This case has been ruled upon and appealed
numerous times over the last several years. In 2019, the Georgia PSC issued an order that found Georgia Power has appropriately
implemented the municipal franchise fee schedule. In March 2021, the Superior Court of Fulton County granted class certification
and Georgia Power's motion for summary judgment and the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. In April 2021, Georgia Power filed a
notice of cross appeal on the issue of class certification. In December 2021, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior
Court's ruling that granted summary judgment to Georgia Power and dismissed Georgia Power's cross appeal on the issue of class
certification as moot. Also in December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Georgia Supreme Court,
which was denied on January 27, 2023. On February 6, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with the Georgia
Supreme Court. The amount of any possible losses cannot be estimated at this time because, among other factors, it is unknown
whether any losses would be subject to recovery from any municipalities.
Plant Scherer
In July 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a complaint, which was amended on December 9, 2022, in the Superior Court of
Fulton County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer has impacted
groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of
monetary damages including punitive damages, a medical monitoring fund, and injunctive relief. Georgia Power has filed multiple
motions to dismiss the complaint. On December 29, 2022, the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia granted Georgia Power's
motion to transfer the case to the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia.
In October 2021 and on February 7, 2022, a total of seven additional complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Monroe
County, Georgia against Georgia Power alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in
alleged personal injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive
damages. In November 2021 and March 2022, Georgia Power removed these cases to the U.S. District Court for the Middle
District of Georgia. On November 16, 2022, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaints without prejudice. Georgia Power
anticipates that these plaintiffs will refile their complaints.
On January 9, 2023, an additional complaint was filed in the Superior Court of Monroe County, Georgia against Georgia Power
alleging that the construction and operation of Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater and air, resulting in alleged personal
injuries. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, including punitive damages. On January 19, 2023,

The amount of any possible losses from these matters cannot be estimated at this time.
Mississippi Power
In 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the
three then-serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which was
amended in March 2019 to include four additional plaintiffs. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to
charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC
prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi
Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the
initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper and make claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and
intentional wrongdoing. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to $23.5 million in the refund process
by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual
damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The district court dismissed
the amended complaint; however, in March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of the Mississippi
PSC, the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against all
defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for
leave to file a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the proposed second amended complaint, as
well as several additional state law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power failed to disclose the annual percentage
rate of interest applicable to refunds. In November 2020, the district court denied each of the plaintiffs' pending motions and
entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. In January 2021, the district court denied further motions by the plaintiffs to
vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. In February 2021, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On March 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an
opinion affirming the dismissal of the claims against the Mississippi PSC defendants but reversing the dismissal of the claims
against Mississippi Power. On May 31, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a petition by Mississippi Power
for a rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for further
proceedings. On June 17, 2022, Mississippi Power filed with the trial court a motion to dismiss the complaint. An adverse outcome
in this proceeding could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of
waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur
substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities
conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known
impacted sites in the financial statements. A liability for environmental remediation costs is recognized only when a loss is
determined to be probable and reasonably estimable and is reduced as expenditures are incurred. The traditional electric operating
companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have each received authority from their respective state
PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory
mechanisms. Any difference between the liabilities accrued and costs recovered through rates is deferred as a regulatory asset or
liability. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other
applicable state regulatory agencies.
Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site
Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and assessment and
potential cleanup of such sites is expected. For all years presented, Georgia Power recovered approximately $12 million annually
through the ECCR tariff for environmental remediation under the 2019 ARP. Effective January 1, 2023, Georgia Power is
recovering $5 million annually through the ECCR tariff under the 2022 ARP.
Southern Company Gas is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with 40 former MGP sites in four different
states. Southern Company Gas' accrued environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was based on the
estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with these sites.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the environmental remediation liability and the balance of under recovered environmental
remediation costs were reflected in the balance sheets of Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern Company Gas as shown
in the table below. Alabama Power did not have environmental remediation liabilities at December 31, 2022 or 2021. Mississippi

impact on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
Acting through the DOE and pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. government entered into contracts with
Alabama Power and Georgia Power that required the DOE to dispose of spent nuclear fuel generated at Plants Farley, Hatch, and
Vogtle Units 1 and 2 beginning no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE has yet to commence the performance of its contractual
and statutory obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Consequently, Alabama Power and Georgia Power pursued and continue to
pursue legal remedies against the U.S. government for its partial breach of contract.
In 2014, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed lawsuits against the U.S. government for the costs of continuing to store spent
nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. The
damage period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2014. In 2019, the Court of Federal Claims granted Alabama Power's
and Georgia Power's motion for summary judgment on damages not disputed by the U.S. government, awarding those undisputed
damages to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. However, those undisputed damages are not collectible until the court enters final
judgment on the remaining damages.
In 2017, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed additional lawsuits against the U.S. government in the Court of Federal Claims
for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January
1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. In 2020, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed amended complaints in each of the lawsuits
adding damages from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 to the claim period.
The outstanding claims for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019 total $110 million and $132 million for Alabama
Power and Georgia Power (based on its ownership interests), respectively. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is
resolved, the U.S. government disposes of Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's spent nuclear fuel pursuant to its contractual
obligations, or alternative storage is otherwise provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial statements as of
December 31, 2022 for any potential recoveries from the pending lawsuits.
II-161
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect to credit
any recoveries for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from their respective PSC; therefore, no material impact on
Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income is expected.
On-site dry spent fuel storage facilities are operational at all three plants and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through
the expected life of each plant.
Nuclear Insurance
Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements of indemnity with the
NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies'
nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $13.7 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear
incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $450 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI),
with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear
incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $138 million per incident for each
licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $20 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor.
Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its
ownership and buyback interests in all licensed reactors, is $275 million and $330 million, respectively, per incident, but not more
than an aggregate of $41 million and $49 million, respectively, to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum
assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years. The next scheduled
adjustment is due no later than November 1, 2023. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information on
joint ownership agreements.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to
provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $1.5 billion for members' operating nuclear generating facilities.
Additionally, both companies have NEIL policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature
decommissioning coverage up to $1.25 billion for nuclear losses and policies providing coverage up to $750 million for non-
nuclear losses in excess of the $1.5 billion primary coverage.
NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage
at a member's nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a
maximum per occurrence per unit limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase limits based on
the projected full cost of replacement power, subject to ownership limitations, and have each elected a 12-week deductible waiting
period for each nuclear plant.
A builders' risk property insurance policy has been purchased from NEIL for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This
policy provides the Vogtle Owners up to $2.75 billion for accidental property damage occurring during construction.
Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments each year if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to
the insurer. The maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power as of December 31, 2022 under the NEIL
policies would be $51 million and $85 million, respectively.
Claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to normal policy
limits). The maximum aggregate that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events in any 12-month
period is $3.2 billion each, plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.
For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such
policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any
remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the NRC,
and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the applicable company or to its debt trustees as may be appropriate
under the policies and applicable trust indentures. In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to
cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from
customers, would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, and could have a material effect on Southern
Company's, Alabama Power's, and Georgia Power's financial condition and results of operations.
All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable state
premium taxes.

Other Matters
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
In April 2019, Bellsouth Telecommunications d/b/a AT&T Alabama (AT&T) filed a complaint against Alabama Power with the
FCC alleging that the pole rental rate AT&T is required to pay pursuant to the parties' joint use agreement is unjust and
unreasonable under federal law. The complaint sought a new rate and approximately $87 million in refunds of alleged
overpayments for the preceding six years. In August 2019, the FCC stayed the case in favor of arbitration, which AT&T has not
pursued. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but an adverse outcome could have a material
impact on the financial statements of Southern Company and Alabama Power. Georgia Power and Mississippi Power have joint use
agreements with other AT&T affiliates.
Mississippi Power
Kemper County Energy Facility
In 2020, 2021, and 2022, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income associated with abandonment and related closure costs and
ongoing period costs, net of salvage proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. These
charges, including related tax impacts, totaled $4 million pre-tax ($3 million after tax) in 2020, $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after
tax) in 2021, and $15 million pre-tax ($12 million after tax) in 2022. The pre-tax charges are included in other operations and
maintenance expenses on the statements of income.
Dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities are expected to be completed by 2026.
Additional pre-tax period costs associated with dismantlement and site restoration activities, including related costs for compliance
and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes, net of salvage, are estimated to total approximately $15 million annually through
2025.
Mississippi Power owns the lignite mine located around the Kemper County energy facility site. As a result of the abandonment of
the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to
continue through 2028.
As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation,
has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation
activities. See Note 6 for additional information.
In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $270 million of the Kemper County energy facility
through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. In 2016, additional DOE
grants in the amount of $137 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the
DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the $387 million of total grants received. In 2020,
Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's request, which
enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration
activities. In connection with the DOE closeout discussions, in 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed
Southern Company and Mississippi Power of an investigation related to the grants received. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's
financial statements.
Plant Daniel
In conjunction with Southern Company's 2019 sale of Gulf Power, NextEra Energy held back $75 million of the purchase price
pending Mississippi Power and NextEra Energy negotiating a mutually acceptable revised operating agreement for Plant Daniel.
On July 12, 2022, the co-owners executed a revised operating agreement and Southern Company subsequently received the
remaining $75 million of the purchase price. The dispatch procedures in the revised operating agreement for the two jointly-owned
coal units at Plant Daniel resulted in Mississippi Power designating one of the two units as primary and the other as secondary in
lieu of each company separately owning 100% of a single generating unit. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase its co-
owner's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days
prior to that date. The revised operating agreement did not have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. See
Note 2 under "Mississippi Power – Integrated Resource Plan" for additional information on Plant Daniel.
Department of Revenue Audit
On August 31, 2022, the Mississippi Department of Revenue (Mississippi DOR) completed an audit of sales and use taxes paid by
Mississippi Power from 2016 to 2019 and entered a final assessment, indicating a total amount due of $28 million, including
II-163
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
associated penalties and interest. Mississippi Power does not agree with the audit findings and, on October 27, 2022, filed an
administrative appeal with the Mississippi DOR.
On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to defer the additional
taxes and related interest related to the audit to a regulatory asset, excluding amounts associated with the gasifier and other
abandoned Kemper IGCC assets. The authority to defer these costs is not a guarantee of recovery. The review and final disposition
of the costs recorded to the regulatory asset will be addressed in a future rate proceeding following completion of the tax audit
proceedings.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Commitments
To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the Southern Company system's electric generating plants, the Southern Company
system has entered into various long-term commitments not recognized on the balance sheets for the procurement and delivery of
fossil fuel and, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, nuclear fuel. The majority of the Registrants' fuel expense for the periods
presented was purchased under long-term commitments. Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its future fuel needs
will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.
Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of
Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether
or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2
investment relate to costs in excess of Georgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these
portions at the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in
Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power, non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income.
Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $4 million, $6 million, and $5 million in 2022, 2021, and
2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $41
million, consisting of $3 million for 2023, $4 million annually for 2024 and 2025, $2 million annually for 2026 and 2027, and $26
million thereafter.
See Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.
Southern Company Gas has commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply, including charges recoverable
through natural gas cost recovery mechanisms or, alternatively, billed to marketers selling retail natural gas. Gas supply
commitments include amounts for gas commodity purchases associated with Nicor Gas and SouthStar of 34 million mmBtu at
floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2022 and valued at $157 million. Southern
Company Gas provides guarantees to certain gas suppliers for certain of its subsidiaries in support of payment obligations.
Southern Company Gas' expected future contractual obligations for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply that are not
recognized on the balance sheets at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

Guarantees
SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power may be jointly and severally liable. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements with
each of the traditional electric operating companies to ensure they will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses,
liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these agreements.

Alabama Power has guaranteed a $100 million principal amount long-term bank loan SEGCO entered into in 2018 and
subsequently extended and amended. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the portion of such obligation
corresponding to Georgia Power's proportionate ownership of SEGCO's stock if Alabama Power is called upon to make such
payment under its guarantee. At December 31, 2022, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $80 million of equity and $100
million of long-term debt that matures in November 2024, on which the annual interest requirement is derived from a variable rate
index. In addition, SEGCO had short-term debt outstanding of $17 million. See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for additional information.
As discussed in Note 9, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees related to railcar
leases.
4. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources, some of which are not accounted for as revenue from contracts with
customers, such as leases, derivatives, and certain cost recovery mechanisms. See Note 1 under "Revenues" for additional
information on the revenue policies of the Registrants. See Notes 9 and 14 for additional information on revenue accounted for
under lease and derivative accounting guidance, respectively.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Georgia Power had contract assets primarily related to retail customer fixed bill programs, where
the payment is contingent upon Georgia Power's continued performance and the customer's continued participation in the program
over a one-year contract term, and unregulated service agreements, where payment is contingent on project completion. Contract
liabilities for Georgia Power relate to cash collections recognized in advance of revenue for unregulated service agreements.
Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business had contract assets of $65 million and $50 million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and contract liabilities of $32 million and $39 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, for outstanding performance obligations.
Revenues recognized in 2022 and 2021, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
respectively, were $36 million and $29 million, respectively, for Southern Company and immaterial for the other Registrants.
Remaining Performance Obligations
The Subsidiary Registrants have long-term contracts with customers in which revenues are recognized as performance obligations
are satisfied over the contract term. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, these contracts primarily
relate to PPAs whereby electricity and generation capacity are provided to a customer. The revenue recognized for the delivery of
electricity is variable; however, certain PPAs include a fixed payment for fixed generation capacity over the term of the contract.
For Southern Company Gas, these contracts involve energy infrastructure enhancement and upgrade projects for certain
governmental customers. Southern Company's unregulated distributed generation business also has partially satisfied performance
obligations related to certain fixed price contracts. Revenues from contracts with customers related to these performance
obligations remaining at December 31, 2022 are expected to be recognized as follows:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and
replacement of minor items of property is charged to other operations and maintenance expenses as incurred or performed with the
exception of nuclear refueling costs and certain maintenance costs including those described below.
In accordance with orders from their respective state PSCs, Alabama Power and Georgia Power defer nuclear refueling outage
operations and maintenance expenses to a regulatory asset when the charges are incurred. Alabama Power amortizes the costs
II-169
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
over a subsequent 18-month period with Plant Farley's fall outage cost amortization beginning in January of the following year and
spring outage cost amortization beginning in July of the same year. Georgia Power amortizes its costs over each unit's operating
cycle, or 18 months for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and 24 months for Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power's amortization
period begins the month the refueling outage starts.
A portion of Mississippi Power's railway track maintenance costs is charged to fuel stock and recovered through Mississippi
Power's fuel clause.
The portion of Southern Company Gas' non-working gas used to maintain the structural integrity of natural gas storage facilities
that is considered to be non-recoverable is depreciated, while the recoverable or retained portion is not depreciated.
See Note 9 for information on finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, net, which are included in property, plant, and equipment.
The Registrants have deferred certain implementation costs related to cloud hosting arrangements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021,
deferred cloud implementation costs, net of amortization, which are generally included in other deferred charges and assets on the
Registrants' balance sheets, are as follows:

At December 31, 2021 240 54 81 11 14 35 
Once a hosted software is placed into service, the related deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining
expected hosting arrangement term, including any renewal options that are reasonably certain of exercise. The amortization is
reflected with the associated cloud hosting fees, which are generally reflected in other operations and maintenance expenses on the
Registrants' statements of income. In 2022, amortization of deferred cloud implementation costs recognized was $29 million for
Southern Company, $8 million for Alabama Power, $12 million for Georgia Power, and immaterial for the other Registrants. In
2021, amortization from deferred cloud implementation costs was immaterial for all Registrants.
See Note 2 under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities," "Alabama Power – Software Accounting Order," and "Mississippi Power –
Software Accounting Order" for information on deferrals of certain other operations and maintenance costs associated with
software and cloud computing projects by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities, as
authorized by their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies.
Depreciation and Amortization
The traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service
is provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates. The approximate rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows:
2022 2021 2020
Alabama Power 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.6 %
Georgia Power 3.3 % 3.3 % 3.0 %
Mississippi Power 3.4 % 3.6 % 3.7 %
Southern Company Gas 2.7 % 2.8 % 2.8 %
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are filed with the respective state PSC
and/or other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas
distribution utilities. Effective April 1, 2020, Mississippi Power's depreciation rates were revised. Effective January 1, 2023,
Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's depreciation rates were revised. See Note 2 for additional information.
When property, plant, and equipment subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other
property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet accounts, and a gain or
loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the asset are retired when the related property unit is
retired.
II-170
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, accumulated depreciation for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas consisted of utility
plant in service totaling $34.3 billion and $33.1 billion, respectively, for Southern Company and $5.1 billion and $4.8 billion,
respectively, for Southern Company Gas, as well as other plant in service totaling $963 million and $930 million, respectively, for
Southern Company and $184 million and $219 million, respectively, for Southern Company Gas. Other plant in service includes
the non-utility assets of Southern Company Gas, as well as, for Southern Company, certain other non-utility subsidiaries.
Depreciation of the original cost of other plant in service is provided primarily on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.
Useful lives for Southern Company Gas's non-utility assets range from five to 12 years for transportation equipment, 30 to 75 years
for storage facilities, and up to 75 years for other assets. Useful lives for the assets of Southern Company's other non-utility
subsidiaries range up to 30 years.
Southern Power
Southern Power applies component depreciation, where depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of the asset. Certain of Southern Power's generation assets related to natural gas-fired facilities are depreciated
on a units-of-production basis, using hours or starts, to better match outage and maintenance costs to the usage of, and revenues
from, these assets. The primary assets in Southern Power's property, plant, and equipment are generating facilities, which generally
have estimated useful lives as follows:
Southern Power Generating Facility Useful life
Natural gas Up to 50 years
Solar Up to 35 years
Wind Up to 35 years
(*)Effective January 1, 2022, Southern Power revised the depreciable lives of its wind generating facilities from up to 30 years to up to 35 years. This revision
resulted in an immaterial decrease in depreciation for 2022.
When Southern Power's depreciable property, plant, and equipment is retired, or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed and a gain or loss is recognized in the statements of income.
Southern Power reviews its estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could result
in changes which could have a material impact on Southern Power's net income.(*)

6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of
future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the
timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future
removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance
from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for
long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations
are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as
regulatory assets.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule
and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations
related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See "Nuclear Decommissioning" herein for additional information. Other significant
AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum
cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind
facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as
obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term
assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these
assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is
indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these
retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the
ARO.
Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of
income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance
with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as
either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.

Rule and the related state rule based on updated estimates for post-closure costs at its ash ponds and inflation rates.(*)
II-173
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During 2021, Georgia Power refined the cost estimates related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in
compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule, including updates to estimates for inflation rates and the timing of closure
activities, and recorded an increase of approximately $435 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In
December 2022, Georgia Power recorded a net decrease of approximately $780 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and
the related state rule resulting from changes in estimates, including lower future inflation rates, higher discount rates, and timing of
closure activities, as well as a change in closure methodology for one ash pond as approved in Georgia Power's 2022 IRP. See Note
2 under "Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans" for additional information.
During 2021, Mississippi Power recorded an increase of approximately $31 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule based on
updated estimates for the timing of closure activities, post-closure costs at one of its ash ponds, and inflation rates.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2022 using various
assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential
methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have
periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR
unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates
may be, material. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The
cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for
others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental
regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and
financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. The
ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Decommissioning
The NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds
for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's
regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the
IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers,
neither Southern Company nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to
mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated third-
party managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers are authorized,
within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on
the Funds' investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities
and are reported as trading securities.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power record the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note 13, as
management believes that fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, are
recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs in the balance sheets and are not included in net income or OCI. Fair value
adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.
The Funds at Georgia Power participate in a securities lending program through the managers of the Funds. Under this program,
Georgia Power's Funds' investment securities are loaned to institutional investors for a fee. Securities loaned are fully collateralized
by cash, letters of credit, and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $35 million and $42 million, respectively, of the fair market value of Georgia Power's
Funds' securities were on loan and pledged to creditors under the Funds' managers' securities lending program. The fair value of the
collateral received was approximately $36 million and $43 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and can only be
sold by the borrower upon the return of the loaned securities. The collateral received is treated as a non-cash item in the statements
of cash flows.

within the Funds are presented separately in the statements of cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the nature of the
securities and purpose for which the securities were acquired.
For Alabama Power, approximately $14 million and $15 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, previously recorded
in internal reserves is being transferred into the Funds through 2040 as approved by the Alabama PSC.
The NRC's minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the
radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed plans
with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide the minimum funding
amounts prescribed by the NRC.

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The decommissioning cost estimates are
based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from these
estimates because of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the
assumptions used in making these estimates. The estimated costs of decommissioning at December 31, 2022 based on the most
current studies, which were performed in 2018 for Alabama Power and in 2021 for Georgia Power, were as follows:

Non-radiated structures 99 61 85 
Total site study costs $ 1,720 $ 1,018 $ 883 
(*)Based on Georgia Power's ownership interests.
For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power's decommissioning costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power's
decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities and the site
study estimate for spent fuel management as of 2021. Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an
estimated inflation rate of 4.5% and 2.5% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and an estimated trust earnings rate
of 7.0% and 4.5% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. The next site study for Alabama Power is expected to be
completed later in 2023.
Alabama Power's site-specific estimates of decommissioning costs for Plant Farley are updated every five years. Projections of
funds are reviewed with the Alabama PSC to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide adequate
funding to cover the site-specific costs. If necessary, Alabama Power would seek the Alabama PSC's approval to address any
changes in a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements.
Under the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking was a total of $4 million for Plant Hatch and
Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Effective January 1, 2023, as approved in the 2022 ARP, there is no annual decommissioning cost for
ratemaking. Any funding amount required by the NRC during the period covered by the 2022 ARP will be deferred to a regulatory
asset and recovery is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate case. See Note 2 under "Georgia Power – Rate
Plans – 2022 ARP" for additional information.
7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. If a venture is a VIE for which a Registrant
is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the
conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.(*) (*)
II-176
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the
investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are
consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the
balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity
method investments in the statements of income. See "SEGCO" and "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.
Southern Company
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $112 million and $101 million,
respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings from
these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.
SEGCO
Alabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating
units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Retirement of SEGCO's generating
units is expected to occur by December 31, 2028. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method;
Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a
ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $124 million in
2022, $75 million in 2021, and $67 million in 2020 for Alabama Power and $127 million in 2022, $77 million in 2021, and $69
million in 2020 for Georgia Power.
SEGCO paid dividends of $14 million in 2022, $14 million in 2021, and $12 million in 2020, one half of which were paid to each
of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net
income.
Alabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership
agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the
remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.
See Note 3 under "Guarantees" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to
SEGCO.
Southern Power
Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of
these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets,
and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.
SP Solar and SP Wind
SP Solar is owned by Southern Power and Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic). A wholly-owned subsidiary
of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest, and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern
Power owns a 66% ownership interest. Global Atlantic is the limited partner and holds the remaining 33% noncontrolling interest.
SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited partnership and the 33% limited partner does not have
substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, SP Solar had total assets of $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $0.4
billion, and noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33%
to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement,
distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated to distribute all such available
cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate
operating reserves.
SP Wind is owned by Southern Power and three financial investors. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns 100% of
the Class B membership interests and the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind
II-177
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
qualifies as a VIE since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have
substantive kick-out rights against Southern Power.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, SP Wind had total assets of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $169
million and $130 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $39 million and $41 million, respectively. Under the terms of
the limited liability agreement, distributions without Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated
to distribute all such available cash to its members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to
the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated 60% to Southern Power
and 40% to the three financial investors in accordance with the limited liability agreement.
Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities
of each entity, including operating and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to
partner consent and the liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working
capital items and do not include any long-term debt.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax
equity investors or acquired less than a 100% interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the
arrangements are structured similar to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling members do not have substantive kick-out
rights.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the other VIEs had total assets of $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $0.2
billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Under the terms of
the partnership agreements, distributions of all available cash are required each month or quarter and additional distributions
require partner consent.
Equity Method Investments
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Southern Power had equity method investments in wind and battery energy storage projects
totaling $49 million and $86 million, respectively. Earnings (loss) from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.
During 2022, Southern Power sold equity method investments in wind projects and received proceeds totaling $38 million. The
gains associated with the sales were immaterial. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, Southern Power sold its remaining equity
method investments in wind and battery energy storage projects and received proceeds of $50 million. The gains associated with
the transactions were immaterial.

2021 cancellation of the project. For 2020, earnings primarily result from AFUDC equity recorded by the project entity.
PennEast Pipeline Project
In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a partnership in which it holds a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline, an
interstate pipeline company formed to develop and operate an approximate 118-mile natural gas pipeline between New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. In 2019, an appellate court ruled that the PennEast Pipeline does not have federal eminent domain authority over
lands in which a state has property rights interests. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PennEast Pipeline
following a review of the appellate court decision. Southern Company Gas assesses its equity method investments for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment may be impaired. Following the U.S. Supreme Court
ruling, during the second quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas management reassessed the project construction timing, including
the anticipated timing for receipt of a FERC certificate and all remaining state and local permits, as well as potential challenges
thereto, and performed an impairment analysis. The outcome of the analysis resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $82 million
($58 million after tax). In September 2021, PennEast Pipeline announced that further development of the project was no longer
supported, and, as a result, all further development of the project ceased. During the third quarter 2021, Southern Company Gas
recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $2 million ($2 million after tax) related to its share of the project level impairment, as well
as $7 million of additional tax expense, resulting in total pre-tax charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) during 2021 related
to the project.(*)

DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings
Pursuant to the loan guarantee program established under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Title XVII Loan Guarantee
Program), Georgia Power and the DOE entered into a loan guarantee agreement in 2014 and the Amended and Restated Loan
Guarantee Agreement in 2019. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee the
obligations of Georgia Power under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, Georgia Power was authorized to
make term loan borrowings through the FFB in an amount up to approximately $5.130 billion, provided that total aggregate
borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities could not exceed 70% of (i) Eligible Project Costs minus (ii) approximately $1.492
billion (reflecting the amounts received by Georgia Power under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement less the related customer
refunds).
In 2021, Georgia Power made the final borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities and no further borrowings are permitted. During
2022, Georgia Power made principal amortization payments of $88 million under the FFB Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2022
and 2021, Georgia Power had $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the FFB Credit Facilities, respectively.
All borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities are full recourse to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power is obligated to reimburse the
DOE for any payments the DOE is required to make to the FFB under its guarantee. Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to
the DOE are full recourse and secured by a first priority lien on (i) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4 (primarily the units under construction, the related real property, and any nuclear fuel loaded in the reactor core) and
(ii) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. There are no
restrictions on Georgia Power's ability to grant liens on other property.
The final maturity date for each advance under the FFB Credit Facilities is February 20, 2044. Interest is payable quarterly and
principal payments began in February 2020. Each borrowing under the FFB Credit Facilities bears interest at a fixed rate equal to
the applicable U.S. Treasury rate at the time of the borrowing plus a spread equal to 0.375%.
Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, Georgia Power is subject to customary borrower affirmative and
negative covenants and events of default. In addition, Georgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other
project-specific covenants and events of default.
In the event certain mandatory prepayment events occur, Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal
amount of all borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years (with level principal amortization). Among
other things, these mandatory prepayment events include (i) the termination of the Vogtle Services Agreement or rejection of the
Vogtle Services Agreement in any Westinghouse bankruptcy if Georgia Power does not maintain access to intellectual property
rights under the related intellectual property licenses; (ii) termination of the Bechtel Agreement, unless the Vogtle Owners enter into
a replacement agreement; (iii) cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the Georgia PSC or by Georgia Power; (iv) failure of
the holders of 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to vote to continue construction following certain
schedule extensions; (v) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on completion of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities; or (vi) loss of
or failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from an
event of taking must be applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Georgia Power also
may voluntarily prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, any prepayment
(whether mandatory or optional) will be made with a make-whole premium or discount, as applicable.(a) (b) (c)
II-182
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In connection with any cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the DOE may elect to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4. In such an event, the DOE will have the right to assume Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal
agreements relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and to acquire all or a portion of Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
See Note 2 under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Secured Debt
Each of Southern Company's subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from Southern Company and its other
subsidiaries. There are no agreements or other arrangements among the Southern Company system companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of Southern Company or any of its
other subsidiaries.
As discussed under "Long-term Debt" herein, the Registrants had secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Each
Registrant's senior notes, junior subordinated notes, revenue bond obligations, bank term loans, credit facility borrowings, and
notes payable are effectively subordinated to all secured debt of each respective Registrant.
Equity Units
In May 2022, Southern Company remarketed $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2019A Remarketable Junior
Subordinated Notes due August 1, 2024 (2019A RSNs) and $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2019B
Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes due August 1, 2027 (2019B RSNs), pursuant to the terms of its 2019 Series A Equity
Units (Equity Units). In connection with the remarketing, the interest rates on the 2019A RSNs and the 2019B RSNs were reset to
4.475% and 5.113%, respectively, payable on a semi-annual basis. On August 1, 2022, the proceeds were ultimately used to settle
the purchase contracts entered into as part of the Equity Units and Southern Company issued approximately 25.2 million shares of
common stock and received proceeds of $1.725 billion. At December 30, 2022 and 2021, the 2019A RSNs and the 2019B RSNs are
included in long-term debt on Southern Company's consolidated balance sheets.

(a)Does not include Southern Power Company's two $75 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $9 million and $5
million, respectively, was unused at December 31, 2022. In December 2022, Southern Power amended one of the $75 million letter of credit facilities, which
extended the expiration date from 2023 to 2025. The second $75 million letter of credit facility also expires in 2025. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not
parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b)Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $800 million of the credit
arrangement expiring in 2026. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement expiring in 2026 also includes $700 million for which Nicor Gas is the
borrower and which is restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to the multi-year credit arrangement expiring in 2026, the allocations between
Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted. Nicor Gas is also the borrower under a $250 million credit arrangement expiring in 2023. See
"Structural Considerations" herein for additional information.
The bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment
fees average less than /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and
its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith,
Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments
thereunder.(a)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO, contain
covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration or, in the case of Southern Power, cross-default provisions to other
indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such cross-
default provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Southern Power defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee
obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if
the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Southern
Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined
in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total
capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt excludes junior subordinated notes and, in
certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes of these
definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-
recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2022, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit
arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric
operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate
revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2022 was
approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69
million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2022, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $120
million and $288 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next
12 months.
At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, Southern Power had $106 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements,
which is included in other deferred charges and assets on Southern Power's consolidated balance sheets.
Notes Payable
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the
liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above under "Bank Credit Arrangements." Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not parties or obligors to its commercial paper program. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper
programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and at Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports working capital
needs at Nicor Gas as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of Southern Company Gas' other
subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program. See "Structural Considerations" herein for
additional information.
In addition, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various bank term loan agreements. Unless
otherwise stated, the proceeds of these loans were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including
working capital and, for the subsidiaries, their continuous construction programs.

Diluted Earnings Per Share
For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is attributable to awards
outstanding under stock-based compensation plans. Earnings per share dilution resulting from stock-based compensation plans is
determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute diluted EPS were as follows:
 Average Common Stock Shares
 2022 2021 2020

As reported shares 1,075 1,061 1,058 
Effect of stock-based compensation 6 7 7 
Diluted shares 1,081 1,068 1,065 
In all years presented, an immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was excluded from the diluted EPS calculation
because the awards were anti-dilutive.
Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries
As discussed further under "Alabama Power" herein, the preferred stock and Class A preferred stock of Alabama Power at
December 31, 2021 is presented as "Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries" on Southern Company's balance sheet in a
manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable accounting standards. During 2022, Alabama Power redeemed all of its
preferred stock and Class A preferred stock.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock authorized, but only common
stock outstanding at December 31, 2022.
During 2022, Alabama Power redeemed all of its preferred stock and Class A preferred stock at the redemption prices per share
provided in the table below, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

Prior to being redeemed, Alabama Power's preferred stock and Class A preferred stock, without preference between classes, ranked
senior to Alabama Power's common stock with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary and involuntary dissolution. The
preferred stock and Class A preferred stock of Alabama Power contained a feature that allowed the holders to elect a majority of
Alabama Power's board of directors if preferred dividends were not paid for four consecutive quarters. Because such a potential
redemption-triggering event was not solely within the control of Alabama Power, the preferred stock and Class A preferred stock at
December 31, 2021 is presented as "Redeemable Preferred Stock" on Alabama Power's balance sheet in a manner consistent with
temporary equity under applicable accounting standards.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock authorized, but only common
stock outstanding.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power has preferred stock and common stock authorized, but only common stock outstanding.

Dividend Restrictions
The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022,
consolidated retained earnings included $4.9 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained
earnings or paid-in-capital.
See Note 7 under "Southern Power" for information regarding the distribution requirements for certain Southern Power
subsidiaries.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to
affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the amount of Southern Company
Gas' subsidiary retained earnings restricted for dividend payment totaled $1.5 billion.
Structural Considerations
Since Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern
Company Gas and, hence, the right of creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution
of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas, whether upon liquidation,
reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.
Southern Company Gas' 100%-owned subsidiary, Southern Company Gas Capital, was established to provide for certain of
Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid
securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by
Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company
Gas Capital for its financing needs.
Southern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement are unsecured senior
indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are
effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern
Power's subsidiaries.

9. LEASES
Lessee
The Registrants recognize leases with a term of greater than 12 months on the balance sheet as lease obligations, representing the
discounted future fixed payments due, along with ROU assets that will be amortized over the term of each lease.
As lessee, the Registrants lease certain electric generating units (including renewable energy facilities), real estate/land,
communication towers, railcars, and other equipment and vehicles. The major categories of lease obligations are as follows:

(*)Amounts related to affiliate leases are eliminated in consolidation for Southern Company. See "Contracts that Contain a Lease" herein for additional
information.
Real estate/land leases primarily consist of commercial real estate leases at Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern
Company Gas and various land leases primarily associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power. The commercial
real estate leases have remaining terms of up to 23 years while the land leases have remaining terms of up to 44 years, including
renewal periods.
Communication towers are leased for the installation of equipment to provide cellular phone service to customers and to support
the automated meter infrastructure programs at the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas. Communication tower
leases have remaining terms of up to 10 years with options to renew that could extend the terms for an additional 20 years.
Renewal options exist in many of the leases. Except as otherwise noted, the expected term used in calculating the lease obligation
generally reflects only the noncancelable period of the lease as it is not considered reasonably certain that the lease will be
extended. Land leases associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power and communication tower leases for
automated meter infrastructure at Nicor Gas include renewal periods reasonably certain of exercise resulting in an expected lease
term at least equal to the expected life of the renewable energy facilities and the automated meter infrastructure, respectively.
Contracts that Contain a Lease
While not specifically structured as a lease, some of the PPAs at Alabama Power and Georgia Power are deemed to represent a
lease of the underlying electric generating units when the terms of the PPA convey the right to control the use of the underlying
assets. Amounts recorded for leases of electric generating units are generally based on the amount of scheduled capacity payments
due over the remaining term of the PPA, which varies between one and 17 years. Georgia Power has several PPAs with Southern
Power that Georgia Power accounts for as leases with a lease obligation of $461 million and $521 million at December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. The amount paid for energy under these affiliate PPAs reflects a price that would be paid in an arm's-length
transaction as reviewed and approved by the Georgia PSC. Amounts related to the affiliate PPAs are eliminated in consolidation for
Southern Company.(*)

Short-term Leases
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Registrants generally recognize lease
expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Residual Value Guarantees
Residual value guarantees exist primarily in railcar leases at Alabama Power and Georgia Power and the amounts probable of being
paid under those guarantees are included in the lease payments. All such amounts are immaterial at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Lease and Nonlease Components
For all asset categories, with the exception of electric generating units, gas pipelines, and real estate leases, the Registrants combine
lease payments and any nonlease components, such as asset maintenance, for purposes of calculating the lease obligation and the
right-of-use asset.

operating and finance leases are considered variable lease costs and are therefore not reflected in the above maturity analysis.
Lessor
The Registrants are each considered lessors in various arrangements that have been determined to contain a lease due to the
customer's ability to control the use of the underlying asset owned by the applicable Registrant. For the traditional electric
operating companies, these arrangements consist of outdoor lighting contracts accounted for as operating leases with initial terms of
up to seven years, after which the contracts renew on a month-to-month basis at the customer's option. For Mississippi Power, these
arrangements also include a tolling arrangement related to an electric generating unit accounted for as a sales-type lease with a
remaining term of 16 years. For Southern Power, these arrangements consist of PPAs related to electric generating units, including
solar and wind facilities, accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 24 years and PPAs related to battery
energy storage facilities accounted for as sales-type leases with remaining terms of up to 19 years. Southern Company Gas is the
lessor in operating leases related to gas pipelines with remaining terms of up to 20 years. For Southern Company, these
arrangements also include PPAs related to fuel cells accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 11 years.

Mississippi Power has a tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type lease. During 2020 and 2021, Mississippi Power
completed construction of additional leased assets under the lease and, upon completion, the book values of $26 million and
$39 million, respectively, were transferred from CWIP to lease receivables. Each transfer represented a non-cash investing
transaction for purposes of the statements of cash flows.
During 2021, Southern Power completed construction of a portion of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities'
assets and recorded losses totaling $40 million upon commencement of the related PPAs, which Southern Power accounts for as
sales-type leases. The losses were due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners in these
projects, and no estimated residual asset value was assumed in calculating the losses. Each lease had an initial term of 20 years.
Upon commencement of the leases, the book values of the related assets totaling $210 million were derecognized from CWIP and
lease receivables were recorded. The transfers represented noncash investing transactions for purposes of the statement of cash
flows. See Note 15 under "Southern Power" for additional information.

Southern Company Leveraged Lease
At December 31, 2020, a subsidiary of Southern Holdings had four leveraged lease agreements related to energy generation,
distribution, and transportation assets, including two domestic and two international projects. During 2021, one of the domestic
projects was sold and the agreements for both international projects were terminated. At December 31, 2022, the one remaining
leveraged lease agreement, which relates to energy generation, had an expected remaining term of nine years. Southern Company
continues to receive federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related
to this investment. Southern Company wrote off the related investment balance in 2020, as discussed below.
During the second quarter 2020, following an evaluation of the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual
value of the generation assets at the end of the lease, Southern Company management concluded it was no longer probable that any
of the associated rental payments scheduled after 2032 would be received, because it was no longer probable the generation assets
would be successfully remarketed and continue to operate after that date. Revising the estimated cash flows to be received under
the leveraged lease to reflect this conclusion resulted in a full impairment of the lease investment and a pre-tax charge to earnings
of $154 million ($74 million after tax).
The following table provides a summary of the components of income related to leveraged lease investments. Income was impacted
in 2021 and 2020 by the impairment charges discussed below and in Note 15 under "Southern Company." Income in 2021 does not
include the impacts of the sale and terminations of leveraged lease projects discussed in Note 15 under "Southern Company."

On June 30, 2022, the Southern Holdings subsidiary operating the generating plant for the lessee provided notice to the lessee to
terminate the related operating and maintenance agreement effective June 30, 2023. The parties to the lease agreement are currently
negotiating a potential restructuring, which could result in rescission of the termination notice. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements.
The lessee failed to make the semi-annual lease payment due December 15, 2022. As a result, the Southern Holdings subsidiary
was unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets.
The parties to the lease have entered into a forbearance agreement which suspends the related contractual rights of the parties while
they continue restructuring negotiations. As the remaining amount of Southern Company's lease investment was charged against
earnings in the second quarter 2020, termination would not be expected to result in additional charges. Southern Company will
continue to monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make
the required lease payments and meet its obligations associated with a future closure or retirement of the generation assets and
associated properties, including the dry ash landfill.
10. INCOME TAXES
Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of
which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis, and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to
that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the federal tax liability.

Southern Company's and Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs generated in the current tax year and carried forward from prior tax
years that cannot be utilized in the current tax year are reclassified from current to deferred taxes in federal income tax expense in
the tables above. Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs reclassified in this manner include $17 million for 2022, $6 million for 2021,
and $5 million for 2020. Southern Power received $49 million, $289 million, and $340 million of cash related to federal ITCs

under renewable energy initiatives in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities" herein for
additional information.
In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional electric operating companies are amortized
over the average life of the related property, with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation and
amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural gas distribution utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as well
as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. ITCs amortized in
2022, 2021, and 2020 were immaterial for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas and were as
follows for Southern Company and Southern Power:
Southern Company Southern Power

2022 $ 83 $ 58 
2021 84 58

When Southern Power recognizes tax credits, the tax basis of the asset is reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net
deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax
expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation.
State ITCs and other state credits, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Georgia Power's
income tax expense by $53 million in 2022, $66 million in 2021, and $67 million in 2020.
Southern Power's federal and state PTCs, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Southern
Power's income tax expense by $27 million in 2022, $16 million in 2021, and $15 million in 2020.
Effective Tax Rate
Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction,
non-taxable AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the
regulated utilities, and federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs primarily at Southern Power.
In July 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent. As a result of the sale, changes in state
apportionment rates resulted in $85 million of additional net state tax expense. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.

The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have tax-related regulatory assets (deferred
income tax charges) and regulatory liabilities (deferred income tax credits). The regulatory assets are primarily attributable to tax
benefits flowed through to customers in prior years, deferred taxes previously recognized at rates lower than the current enacted tax
law, and taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The regulatory liabilities are primarily attributable to deferred taxes previously
recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized ITCs. See Note 2 for each Registrant's related
balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The estimated tax credit utilization reflects the various sale transactions described in Note 15 and could be further delayed by
numerous factors, including the acquisition of additional renewable projects, the purchase of rights to additional PTCs of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 pursuant to certain joint ownership agreements, an increase in Georgia Power's ownership interest percentage
in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, changes in taxable income projections, and potential income tax rate changes. See Note 2 under
"Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

Tax positions changes – increase from prior periods 33 32 
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 $ 80 $ 32 
The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2020 primarily relates to a 2019 state tax filing position to exclude
certain gains from 2019 dispositions from taxation in a certain unitary state. It is possible that this position will be resolved in the
next 12 months, and if accepted by the state, this position would decrease Southern Company's annual effective tax rate.
The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2022 is primarily related to the amendment of certain 2018 state tax
filing positions related to Southern Company Gas dispositions. If accepted by the states, these positions would decrease Southern
Company's and Southern Company Gas' annual effective tax rates. The ultimate outcome of these unrecognized tax benefits is
dependent on acceptance by each state and is not expected to be resolved within the next 12 months.
All of the Registrants classify interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. Accrued interest for all tax positions was immaterial
for all years presented. None of the Registrants accrued any penalties on uncertain tax positions.
The IRS has finalized its audits of Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through 2021. Southern Company
is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process of the IRS. The audits for the Registrants' state income tax returns have either
been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2015.
11. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the
exception of PowerSecure employees. The qualified pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the
year ended December 31, 2022 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated for the year ending
December 31, 2023. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of
management and highly compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system
provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The
traditional electric operating companies fund other postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory
commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care
and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses. For the year ending December 31, 2023, no contributions to
any other postretirement trusts are expected.

The Registrants estimate the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets using a financial
model to project the expected return on each current investment portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each
of the different asset classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust's target asset
allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset
class (based in part on historical returns), each trust's target asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact
of a periodic rebalancing of each trust's portfolio. The Registrants set the expected rate of return assumption using an arithmetic
mean which represents the expected simple average return to be earned by the pension plan assets over any one year. The
Registrants believe the use of the arithmetic mean is more compatible with the expected rate of return's function of estimating a
single year's investment return.

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is included in operations and maintenance expenses and all other
components of net periodic pension cost are included in other income (expense), net in the Registrants' statements of income.
Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected return on plan assets.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related
value of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Registrants have elected to amortize changes in the
market value of return-seeking plan assets over five years and to recognize the changes in the market value of liability-hedging plan
assets immediately. Given the significant concentration in return-seeking plan assets, the accounting value of plan assets that is
used to calculate the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Benefit Plan Assets
Pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The Registrants' investment policies for both the pension plans and the other
postretirement benefit plans cover a diversified mix of assets as described below. Derivative instruments may be used to gain
efficient exposure to the various asset classes and as hedging tools. Additionally, the Registrants minimize the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitor and manage other aspects of risk.
The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Southern Company system's qualified pension plan is to be broadly diversified
across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after consideration of various factors that affect the assets and
liabilities of the pension plan including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns and interest rates, volatility, correlations
of asset classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and liabilities. Because a significant
portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment
expectations for return and risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the Southern
Company system employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment managers and
service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent investment practices. Management believes the
portfolio is well-diversified with no significant concentrations of risk.
Southern Company's investment strategy also includes adjusting the established asset allocation to invest a larger portion of the
portfolio in fixed rate debt securities should the qualified pension plan achieve a predetermined funding threshold, which occurred
during 2022.
Investment Strategies and Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values
A description of the major asset classes that the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are comprised of, along with the
valuation methods used for fair value measurement, is provided below:
Description Valuation Methodology
Domestic equity: A mix of large and small capitalization stocks
with generally an equal distribution of value and growth
attributes, managed both actively and through passive index
approaches.
International equity: A mix of large and small capitalization
growth and value stocks with developed and emerging markets
exposure, managed both actively and through fundamental
indexing approaches.Domestic and international equities such as common stocks,
American depositary receipts, and real estate investment trusts
that trade on public exchanges are classified as Level 1
investments and are valued at the closing price in the active
market. Equity funds with unpublished prices that are comprised
of publicly traded securities (such as commingled/pooled funds)
are also valued at the closing price in the active market, but are
classified as Level 2.
Fixed income: A mix of domestic and international bonds.Investments in fixed income securities, including fixed income
pooled funds, are generally classified as Level 2 investments and
are valued based on prices reported in the market place.
Additionally, the value of fixed income securities takes into
consideration certain items such as broker quotes, spreads, yield
curves, interest rates, and discount rates that apply to the term of
a specific instrument.
Trust-owned life insurance (TOLI): Investments of taxable
trusts aimed at minimizing the impact of taxes on the portfolio.Investments in TOLI policies are classified as Level 2
investments and are valued based on the underlying investments
held in the policy's separate accounts. The underlying assets are
equity and fixed income pooled funds that are comprised of
Level 1 and Level 2 securities.
Real estate: Investments in traditional private market, equity-
oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate
securities.
Special situations: Investments in opportunistic strategies with
the objective of diversifying and enhancing returns and
exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as investments in
promising new strategies of a longer-term nature.
Private equity: Investments in private partnerships that invest in
private or public securities typically through privately-negotiated
and/or structured transactions, including leveraged buyouts,
venture capital, and distressed debt.Investments in real estate, special situations, and private equity
are generally classified as Net Asset Value as a Practical
Expedient, since the underlying assets typically do not have
publicly available observable inputs. The fund manager values
the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the
nature of the underlying investments. Techniques may include
purchase multiples for comparable transactions, comparable
public company trading multiples, discounted cash flow
analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates, recent sales of
comparable investments, and independent third-party appraisals.
The fair value of partnerships is determined by aggregating the
value of the underlying assets less liabilities.

12. STOCK COMPENSATION
Stock-based compensation primarily in the form of Southern Company performance share units (PSU) and restricted stock units
(RSU) may be granted through the Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan to Southern Company system employees ranging from
line management to executives.
At December 31, 2022, the number of current and former employees participating in stock-based compensation programs for the
Registrants was as follows:
Southern
CompanyAlabama
PowerGeorgia
PowerMississippi
PowerSouthern
PowerSouthern
Company Gas
Number of employees 1,586 221 236 64 45 186 
The majority of PSUs and RSUs awarded contain terms where employees become immediately vested in PSUs and RSUs upon
retirement. As a result, compensation expense for employees that are retirement eligible at the grant date is recognized immediately,
while compensation expense for employees that become retirement eligible during the vesting period is recognized over the period
from grant date to the date of retirement eligibility. In addition, the Registrants recognize forfeitures as they occur.
II-229
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All unvested PSUs and RSUs vest immediately upon a change in control where Southern Company is not the surviving
corporation.
Performance Share Units
PSUs granted to employees vest at the end of a three-year performance period. Shares of Southern Company common stock are
delivered to employees at the end of the performance period with the number of shares issued ranging from 0% to 200% of the
target number of PSUs granted, based on achievement of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of the
Southern Company Board of Directors.
Southern Company has issued three types of PSUs, each with a unique performance goal. These types of PSUs include total
shareholder return (TSR) awards based on the TSR for Southern Company common stock during the three-year performance period
as compared to a group of industry peers; ROE awards based on Southern Company's equity-weighted return over the performance
period; and EPS awards based on Southern Company's cumulative EPS over the performance period. EPS awards were last granted
in 2017.
The fair value of TSR awards is determined as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. In determining the fair
value of the TSR awards issued to employees, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Southern Company's
stock over a period equal to the performance period. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant that covers the performance period of the awards. The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model
and the weighted average grant-date fair value of TSR awards granted:
Year Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020
Expected volatility 29.6% 30.0% 15.4%
Expected term (in years) 3 3 3
Interest rate 1.7% 0.2% 1.4%
Weighted average grant-date fair value $79.69 $69.06 $77.65
The Registrants recognize TSR award compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year performance period
without remeasurement.
The fair values of EPS awards and ROE awards are based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the
date of the grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the ROE awards granted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $66.87,
$59.49, and $68.42, respectively. Compensation expense for EPS and ROE awards is generally recognized ratably over the three-
year performance period adjusted for expected changes in EPS and ROE performance. Total compensation cost recognized for
vested EPS awards and ROE awards reflects final performance metrics.
Southern Company had 2.2 million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2021. In February 2022, the PSUs that vested for
the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2021 were converted into 2.5 million shares outstanding at a share price of
$66.57. During 2022, Southern Company granted 1.3 million PSUs and 1.1 million PSUs were vested or forfeited, resulting in 2.4
million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2022. In February 2023, the PSUs that vested for the three-year performance
period ended December 31, 2022 were converted into 1.8 million shares outstanding at a weighted average share price of $67.13.
Total PSU compensation cost, and the related tax benefit recognized in income, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and
2020 are as follows:
2022 2021 2020

Total PSU compensation cost and the related tax benefit recognized in income were immaterial for all periods presented for all
other Registrants. The compensation cost related to the grant of Southern Company PSUs to the employees of each Subsidiary

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Registrant is recognized in each Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity representing a
capital contribution from Southern Company.
At December 31, 2022, Southern Company's total unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs was $31 million and is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 19 months. The total unrecognized compensation cost
related to PSUs at December 31, 2022 was immaterial for all other Registrants.
Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the date of the grant. The
weighted average grant-date fair values of RSUs granted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $67.20, $59.56, and $67.60,
respectively. For most RSU awards, one-third of the RSUs vest each year throughout a three-year service period and compensation
cost for RSUs is generally recognized over the corresponding one-, two-, or three-year vesting period. Shares of Southern Company
common stock are delivered to employees at the end of each vesting period.
Southern Company had 1.1 million RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2021. During 2022, Southern Company granted 0.4 million
RSUs and 0.6 million RSUs were vested or forfeited, resulting in 0.9 million unvested RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2022,
including RSUs related to employee retention agreements.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Southern Company's total compensation cost for RSUs recognized in
income was $26 million, $32 million, and $29 million, respectively. The related tax benefit also recognized in income was $7
million, $8 million, and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Total unrecognized
compensation cost related to RSUs at December 31, 2022, which is being recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately 18 months, is immaterial for Southern Company.
Total RSUs outstanding and total compensation cost and related tax benefit for the RSUs recognized in income for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, as well as the total unrecognized compensation cost at December 31, 2022, were immaterial
for all other Registrants. The compensation cost related to the grant of Southern Company RSUs to the employees of each
Subsidiary Registrant is recognized in such Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity
representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.
Stock Options
In 2015, Southern Company discontinued granting stock options. As of December 31, 2017, all stock option awards were vested
and compensation cost fully recognized. Stock options expire no later than 10 years after the grant date and the latest possible
exercise will occur by November 2024. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the options
outstanding and exercisable was approximately 10 months.
Southern Company's activity in the stock option program for 2022 is summarized below:

Southern Company's cash receipts from issuances related to stock options exercised under the share-based payment arrangements
for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $75 million, $66 million, and $66 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable was $29 million for Southern
Company and immaterial for all other Registrants.

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is
minimized for fair value measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques
used for fair value measurement.
•Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is either directly or indirectly observable.
•Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of each Registrant of what a market
participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If there is little available market data, then each Registrant's own
assumptions are the best available information.
In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement represents the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.
Net asset value as a practical expedient is the classification used for assets that do not have readily determined fair values. Fund
managers value the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the nature of the underlying investments.

Valuation Methodologies
The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and
physical power products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry
and are valued using the market approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas
prices, power prices, implied volatility, and overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-
counter products that are valued using observable market data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair
value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based
on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract
terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair value of cross-currency swaps
reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of
future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms,
counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under
Fair Value Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note 14 for
additional information on how these derivatives are used.
For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred
compensation trusts, external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary
pricing source. For investments held within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the
net asset value, which is established by obtaining the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A
market price secured from the primary source vendor is then evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the
trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather market data (including indices and market research
reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector news into proprietary pricing models,
pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading levels and pricing
analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.
The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of
funds for future decommissioning. See Note 6 under "Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional information.
Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to certain acquisitions whereby it is primarily obligated to make
generation-based payments to the seller, which commenced at the commercial operation of the respective facility and continue
through 2026. The obligations are categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using
significant unobservable inputs for the forecasted facility generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a fixed dollar
amount per MW-hour, and a discount rate. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the net present value of expected
payments and any periodic change arising from forecasted generation is expected to be immaterial.
Southern Power also has payment obligations through 2040 whereby it must reimburse the transmission owners for interconnection
facilities and network upgrades constructed to support connection of a Southern Power generating facility to the transmission
system. The obligations are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using observable
inputs for the contracted amounts and reimbursement period, as well as a discount rate. The fair value of the obligations reflects the
net present value of expected payments.
"Other investments" include investments traded in the open market that have maturities greater than 90 days, which are categorized
as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements and are comprised of corporate bonds, bank certificates of deposit, treasury bonds,
and/or agency bonds.
The fair value measurements of private equity investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that are
calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled $161 million and $150 million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unfunded commitments related to the private equity investments totaled $78 million
and $69 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Private equity investments include high-quality private equity
funds across several market sectors and funds that invest in real estate assets. Private equity funds do not have redemption rights.
Distributions from these funds will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.

(*)The long-term debt of Southern Company Gas is recorded at amortized cost, including the fair value adjustments at the effective date of the 2016 merger with
Southern Company. Southern Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.
The fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or
on the current rates available to the Registrants.
14. DERIVATIVES
The Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally
foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures,
where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Prior to the sale of
Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas operations used various contracts in its commercial activities that
generally met the definition of derivatives. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern
Company Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are
recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note 13 for
additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate
derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating
or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. See Note 1 under
"Financial Instruments" for additional information. See Note 15 under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information
regarding the sale of Sequent.
Energy-Related Derivatives
The Subsidiary Registrants enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price
changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating
companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices.
Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas
manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory
agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The
traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure
to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may be exposed to
market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern
Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results
of operations.
Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges in the event of warmer-than-normal
weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-exchange-traded(*) (*)
II-240
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are
reflected in operating revenues.
Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:
•Regulatory Hedges – Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional
electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are
initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel
is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.
•Cash Flow Hedges – Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to
hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in
the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.
•Not Designated – Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred.
Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is
both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled
physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item
representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.
At December 31, 2022, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest
hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

Southern Power 8 2030 2023
Southern Company Gas 93 2025 2025
(*)Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short
position is a contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of long natural gas positions of 98 million mmBtu and short natural
gas positions of 5 million mmBtu at December 31, 2022, which is also included in Southern Company's total volume. See Note 15 under "Southern Company
Gas" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.
In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical
natural gas supply contracts that provide the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum
expected volume of natural gas subject to such a feature is 23 million mmBtu for Southern Company, which includes 6 million
mmBtu for Alabama Power, 8 million mmBtu for Georgia Power, 3 million mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and 6 million mmBtu
for Southern Power.
For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains (losses) expected to be reclassified from AOCI to
earnings for the year ending December 31, 2023 are $(27) million for Southern Company, $(11) million for Southern Power, and
$(16) million for Southern Company Gas.
Interest Rate Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the
derivatives' fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and presented on the
same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate
securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains
or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same income statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives
that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.(*)

for Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power, 2028 for Mississippi Power, and 2046 for Southern Company Gas.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge
exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency
other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives'
fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same income statement
line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S.
currency exchange rates. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the
derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings on the same
income statement line item, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates.
Southern Company has elected to exclude the cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of effectiveness in the fair value
hedges of its foreign currency risk and record any difference between the change in the fair value of the excluded components and
the amounts recognized in earnings as a component of OCI.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts
The Registrants enter into derivative contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative
receivables and payables for routine billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain
subsidiaries also utilize master netting agreements to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain
provisions that permit netting across product lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and
liabilities on the balance sheets are presented net to the extent that there are netting arrangements or similar agreements with the
counterparties.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of energy-related derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency

accounted for based on intrinsic value rather than fair value. There was no weather derivatives impact for 2021.
The pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial for all other Registrants for
all years presented.
Contingent Features
The Registrants do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a
result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the
event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a
Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2022, the Registrants had no collateral posted with
derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.
For Southern Company and Southern Power, the fair value of interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features and the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or
Baa3, were $78 million and $23 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. For the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements
arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31,
2022. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features for the traditional
electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or
more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.
Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial
derivative transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the
associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2022, cash collateral posted in these accounts was $15 million for Southern
Power and immaterial for Alabama Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of
certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the
associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31,
2022, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $41 million.
The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The
Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by
Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. The Registrants have also(*)
II-248
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including
requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is
most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S.
government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties
an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit
reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when
deemed necessary.
Southern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting
agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash
collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to,
counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables and energy
marketing payables.
The Registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty
nonperformance.
15. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
None of the dispositions discussed herein, both individually and combined, represented a strategic shift in operations for the
applicable Registrants that has, or is expected to have, a major effect on its operations and financial results; therefore, none of the
assets related to the sales have been classified as discontinued operations for any of the periods presented.
Southern Company
In connection with the annual impairment analysis of a leveraged lease investment during the fourth quarter 2020, Southern
Company management concluded that the estimated residual value of the generation assets should be reduced due to significant
uncertainty as to whether the related natural gas generation assets would continue to operate at the end of the lease term in 2040
and recorded a $34 million ($17 million after tax) impairment charge. Also during the fourth quarter 2020, Southern Company
management initiated steps to sell the investment and reclassified it as held for sale. In the fourth quarter 2020 and the second
quarter 2021, additional charges of $18 million ($14 million after tax) and $7 million ($6 million after tax), respectively, were
recorded to further reduce the investment to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. In October 2021, Southern Company
completed the sale to the lessee for $45 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale; however, it did result in the recognition
of approximately $16 million of additional tax benefits.
In December 2021, Southern Company completed the termination of its leasehold interest in assets associated with its two
international leveraged lease projects and received cash proceeds of approximately $673 million after the accelerated exercise of
the lessee's purchase options. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $93 million ($99 million gain
after tax).
Alabama Power
In 2020, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station, an approximately 885-MW
combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The
total purchase price was $461 million, of which $452 million was related to net assets recorded within property, plant, and
equipment on the balance sheet and reflected in property additions within the investing section of the statement of cash flows. The
remainder primarily related to inventory, current receivables, and accounts payable. Alabama Power assumed an existing power
sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to another third party through May 2023.
During the remaining term, the revenues from the power sales agreement are expected to substantially offset the associated costs of
operation. See Note 9 under "Lessor" for additional information.
On September 30, 2022, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station, which was accounted for as
an asset acquisition. The total purchase price was $179 million, of which $171 million was related to net assets recorded within
property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet and reflected in property additions within the investing section of the statement
of cash flows. The remainder primarily related to fossil fuel stock and materials and supplies.
See Note 2 under "Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity" for additional information.

Development Projects
Southern Power purchased wind turbine equipment in 2016 and 2017 for deployment to development and construction projects.
The significant majority of this equipment either has been deployed to projects that have been completed or has been sold to third
parties. Gains on wind turbine equipment contributed to various equity method investments totaled approximately $37 million in
2021. Gains on wind turbine equipment sales were immaterial in 2020 and there were no sales in 2022.
Sale of Plant Mankato
In January 2020, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion unit
completed in 2019) to a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $663 million, including final working
capital adjustments. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $39 million ($23 million after tax). Plant Mankato represented an
individually significant component of Southern Power.
Southern Company Gas
Sale of Sequent
On July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent to Williams Field Services Group for a total cash
purchase price of $159 million, including final working capital adjustments. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was
approximately $121 million ($92 million after tax). The sale resulted in $85 million of additional tax expense.

In March 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline to Dominion
Modular LNG Holdings, Inc. and Dominion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC, respectively, with aggregate proceeds of $178 million,
including final working capital adjustments. The loss associated with the transactions was immaterial. In connection with the sale,
Southern Company Gas received two additional $5 million payments upon Dominion Modular LNG Holdings, Inc. meeting certain
milestones related to Pivotal LNG in April 2021 and May 2022, respectively.
Sale of Natural Gas Storage Facilities
In December 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of Jefferson Island to EnLink Midstream, LLC for a total purchase
price of $33 million, including estimated working capital adjustments. The gain associated with the sale totaled $22 million pre-tax
($16 million after tax).
On September 7, 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities
located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments.
The sale of the Texas facility was completed on November 18, 2022. Completion of the sale of the California facility is expected
later in 2023 and is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, approval from the California Public Utilities
Commission without a material burdensome condition. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Completion of the sale of the Texas facility was subject to release of a Southern Company Gas parent guarantee, which was
executed on October 20, 2022 and, as a result, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately
$131 million ($99 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2022.

16. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
Southern Company
Southern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale
of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products
and services by Southern Company Gas. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies
were $875 million, $515 million, and $364 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Revenues from sales of natural gas from
Southern Company Gas to the traditional electric operating companies were immaterial for all periods presented. Revenues from
sales of natural gas from Southern Company Gas (prior to its sale of Sequent) to Southern Power were $18 million and $26 million
in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The "All Other" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate
operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
disclosure. These segments include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial,
industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications and leveraged lease projects. All
other inter-segment revenues are not material.

Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline
investments, and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments
also included wholesale gas services. The non-reportable segments are combined and presented as all other. See Note 15 under
"Southern Company Gas" for additional information on the disposition activities described herein.
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and includes natural gas local distribution
utilities that construct, manage, and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and gas distribution facilities in four states.
Gas pipeline investments consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50%
joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas
supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. Gas pipeline investments also includes a 20% ownership interest in the
PennEast Pipeline project, which was cancelled in September 2021, and through its March 2020 sale, included a 5% ownership
interest in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline construction project. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information.
Through July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services provided natural gas asset management and/or related logistics services for each of
Southern Company Gas' utilities except Nicor Gas as well as for non-affiliated companies. Additionally, wholesale gas services
engaged in natural gas storage and gas pipeline arbitrage and related activities.
Gas marketing services provides natural gas marketing to end-use customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois through SouthStar.
The all other column includes segments and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including
storage and fuels operations. The all other column included a natural gas storage facility in Texas through its sale on November 18,
2022, Jefferson Island through its sale in December 2020, and Pivotal LNG through its sale in March 2020. See Note 15 to the
financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information, including the sale of a natural gas storage facility
in California expected to be completed later in 2023.
