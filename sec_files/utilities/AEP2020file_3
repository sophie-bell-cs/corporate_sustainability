materially from those projected.  Forward-looking statements in this document are presented as of the date of this
document.  Except to the extent required by applicable law, management undertakes no obligation to update or revise
any forward-looking statement.  Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
forward-looking statements are:
•Changes in economic conditions, electric market demand and demographic patterns in AEP service territories.
•Inflationary or deflationary interest rate trends.
•Volatility in the financial markets, particularly developments affecting the availability or cost of capital to finance
new capital projects and refinance existing debt.
•The availability and cost of funds to finance working capital and capital needs, particularly during periods when
the time lag between incurring costs and recovery is long and the costs are material.
•Decreased demand for electricity.
•Weather conditions, including storms and drought conditions, and the ability to recover significant storm
restoration costs.
•The cost of fuel and its transportation, the creditworthiness and performance of fuel suppliers and transporters and
the cost of storing and disposing of used fuel, including coal ash and SNF.
•The availability of fuel and necessary generation capacity and the performance of generation plants.
•The ability to recover fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates.
•The ability to build or acquire renewable generation, transmission lines and facilities (including the ability to
obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and permits) when needed at acceptable prices and terms and to recover
those costs.
•New legislation, litigation and government regulation, including oversight of nuclear generation, energy
commodity trading and new or heightened requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury,
carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances that could impact the continued operation, cost recovery
and/or profitability of generation plants and related assets.
•Evolving public perception of the risks associated with fuels used before, during and after the generation of
electricity, including coal ash and nuclear fuel.
•Timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions, including rate
or other recovery of new investments in generation, distribution and transmission service and environmental
compliance.
•Resolution of litigation.
•The ability to constrain operation and maintenance costs.
•Prices and demand for power generated and sold at wholesale.
•Changes in technology, particularly with respect to energy storage and new, developing, alternative or distributed
sources of generation.
•The ability to recover through rates any remaining unrecovered investment in generation units that may be retired
before the end of their previously projected useful lives.
•Volatility and changes in markets for coal and other energy-related commodities, particularly changes in the price
of natural gas.
•Changes in utility regulation and the allocation of costs within RTOs including ERCOT, PJM and SPP.
•Changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties with contractual arrangements, including participants in the
energy trading market.
•Actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt.
•The impact of volatility in the capital markets on the value of the investments held by the pension, other
postretirement benefits, captive insurance entity and nuclear decommissioning trust and the impact of such
volatility on future funding requirements.
•Accounting standards periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies.
iv
•Other risks and unforeseen events, including wars, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs),
embargoes, naturally occurring and human-caused fires, cyber security threats and other catastrophic events.
•The ability to attract and retain the requisite work force and key personnel.
The forward-looking statements of the Registrants speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are
made.  The Registrants expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking information, except as
required by law.  For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see “Risk Factors” in Part I of this report.

PART I
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
GENERAL
Overview and Description of Major Subsidiaries
AEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925. It is a public utility
holding company that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries
and varying percentages of other subsidiaries.
The service areas of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. Transmission networks are
interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have
traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to
their retail customers. Restructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public
utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.
The member companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other
member companies, such as participation in the AEP System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of
electricity and transportation and handling of fuel. The companies of the AEP System also obtain certain accounting,
administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a
common provider, AEPSC.
As of December 31, 2019, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 17,408 employees. Because it is a holding company
rather than an operating company, AEP has no employees. The material subsidiaries of AEP are as follows:

approximately 1,049,000 retail customers through REPs in west, central and southern Texas.  As of December 31, 2019,
AEP Texas had 1,585 employees.  Among the principal industries served by AEP Texas are petroleum and coal products
manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, pipeline transportation and primary metal
manufacturing.  The territory served by AEP Texas also includes several military installations and correctional
facilities.  AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT.  AEP Texas is part of AEP’s Transmission and Distribution Utilities
segment.
AEPTCo
Organized in Delaware in 2006, AEPTCo is a holding company for the State Transcos. The State Transcos develop and
own new transmission assets that are physically connected to the AEP System.  Individual State Transcos (a) have
obtained the approvals necessary to operate in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia,
subject to any applicable siting requirements, (b) are authorized to submit projects for commission approval in Virginia
and (c) have been granted consent to enter into a joint license agreement that will support investment in Tennessee.

FINANCING
General
Companies within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs.  Short-term debt
may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such
needs can be financed with long-term debt.  In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash
on hand and AEP’s commercial paper program.  Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate
borrowing program.  Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity.  See
“Financial Condition” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information.
AEP’s revolving credit agreement (which backstops the commercial paper program) includes covenants and events of
default typical for this type of facility, including a maximum debt/capital test.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP’s
payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement
or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under the credit
agreement. As of December 31, 2019, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.  With the exception of a
voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before
termination of the agreement.  A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would
be considered an immediate termination event.  See “Financial Condition” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional
information.
AEP’s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as
securitization financings and leasing arrangements, including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities.
8
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS
General
AEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-
quality control and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local
authorities.  The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are
outlined below.
Clean Water Act Requirements
Operations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants
into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface
water for use in power plants.  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for water withdrawals
at existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water
intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than
two million gallons of cooling water per day.  Compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the
effective date of the final rule.
In November 2015, the Federal EPA issued a final rule revising effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating
facilities. The rule establishes limits on Flue Gas Desulfurization wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water
and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed as soon as possible after November 2018 and no later than
December 2023.  In January 2020, the Federal EPA issued a final rule revising the scope of the “waters of the United
States” subject to Clean Water Act regulation. See “Environmental Issues - Clean Water Act Regulations” section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2019 Annual
Report for additional information.
Coal Ash Regulation
AEP’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion by-products, including fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum
and other materials.  A Federal EPA rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals,
including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units.  The rule requires certain standards
for location, groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at
operating facilities. If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards, they will be required to close. See
“Environmental Issues - Coal Combustion Residual Rule” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information.
Clean Air Act Requirements
The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and
stationary sources of air emissions.  The major CAA programs affecting AEP’s power plants are described below.  The
states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.
The Acid Rain Program
The CAA includes a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2 emissions from power plants and requirements
for power plants to reduce NOx emissions through the use of available combustion controls, collectively called the Acid
Rain Program. AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls,
use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets. 
9
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and
establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and
welfare with an extra safety margin.  The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration
levels for them.  These concentration levels are known as NAAQS.
Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (non-
attainment areas).  Each state must develop a SIP to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and
maintain good air quality in attainment areas.  All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval.  If a state fails to
develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan.  As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS
and establishes new concentration levels, the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to
develop new SIPs.  See “Environmental Issues - Clean Air Act Requirements” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional
information.
Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP)
The CAA also requires the Federal EPA to investigate HAP emissions from the electric utility sector and submit a
report to Congress to determine whether those emissions should be regulated. In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a rule
setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and
New Source Performance Standards for emissions from new and modified power plants.  In 2014, the U.S. Supreme
Court determined that the Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was
appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from electric generating units. The Federal EPA has engaged in
additional rulemaking activity but the 2011 rule remains in effect. See “Environmental Issues - Hazardous Air
Pollutants” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information.
Regional Haze
The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states
to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these protected
areas.  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule, detailing how the CAA’s best available retrofit
technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year
of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.
PSO executed a settlement with the Federal EPA and the State of Oklahoma to comply with Regional Haze program
requirements in Oklahoma, and the settlement is now codified in the Oklahoma SIP and approved by the Federal EPA.
The Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Arkansas and Texas SIPs, and finalized FIPs for both states.  Arkansas
submitted and received approval of a revised SIP, and EPA developed a revised FIP for Texas. See “Environmental
Issues - Clean Air Act Requirements” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information.
Climate Change
AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO2 emissions from its
operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to
diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities. In
2019, AEP announced revised intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals, based on the output of the
company’s integrated resource plans, which take into account economics, customer demand, regulations, grid reliability
and resiliency, and reflect the company’s current business strategy. The intermediate goal is a 70% reduction from 2000
CO2 emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030; the long-term goal is an 80% or more reduction of CO2
emissions from AEP generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050. AEP’s total estimated CO2 emissions in 2019 were
approximately 58 million metric tons, a 65% reduction from AEP’s 2000 CO2 emissions.
10
The Federal EPA has taken action to regulate CO2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating
units under the existing provisions of the CAA.  The Clean Power Plan was adopted in October 2015 but the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a stay of its implementation, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state
plans. The Federal EPA issued a proposal in 2017 to repeal the Clean Power Plan and finalized the repeal in 2019. In
2018 the Federal EPA issued a proposal to revise the standards for new and modified sources. In 2019, the Federal EPA
finalized new guidelines for states to use to develop CO2 performance standards for coal–fired generating units. See
“Environmental Issues - Climate Change, CO2 Regulation and Energy Policy” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional
information.
Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates
fewer coal units.  The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing
cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental
regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.  
Transforming AEP’s Generation Fleet
The electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation, driven by changing customer needs, policy
demands, demographics, competitive offerings, technologies and commodity prices. AEP is also transforming to be
more agile and customer-focused as a valued provider of energy solutions.  AEP’s long-term commitment to reduce
CO2 emissions reflects the current direction of the company’s resource plans to meet those needs.  AEP’s exposure to
carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years.  From 2000 to 2019, AEP’s CO2 emissions
declined 65%.  In 2019, coal represented 45% of AEP’s generating capacity, compared with 70% in 2005.  Management
expects the percentage of AEP’s generating resources fueled by coal will continue to decline.  Transforming AEP’s
generation portfolio to include, where there is regulatory support, more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient
use of energy, demand response, distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid
over time is part of this strategy.
The graph below summarizes AEP’s generation capacity by resource type for the years 1999, 2005 and 2019:
(a) Energy Ef ficiency/Demand Response represents avoided capacity rather than physical assets.
11
Renewable Sources of Energy
The states AEP serves, other than Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee, have established mandatory or voluntary
programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy or renewable energy sources.
As of December 31, 2019, AEP’s regulated utilities had long-term contracts for 2,750 MWs of wind, 80 MWs of hydro,
and 10 MWs of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers. In addition, I&M owns four
solar projects that make up I&M’s 16 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project. Management actively manages AEP’s
compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction.
In July 2019, PSO and SWEPCo submitted filings before their respective commissions for approval to acquire the
North Central Wind Energy Facilities, comprised of three Oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1,485 MWs, on a fixed cost
turn-key basis at completion. Subject to regulatory approval, PSO will own 45.5% and SWEPCo will own 54.5% of the
project, which will cost approximately $2 billion. Two wind facilities, totaling 1,286 MWs, would qualify for 80% of
the federal Production Tax Credits (PTCs) with year-end 2021 in-service dates. The third wind facility (199 MWs)
would qualify for 100% of the PTCs with a year-end 2020 in-service date. The acquisition can be scaled, subject to
commercial limitation, to align with individual state resource needs and approvals. In December 2019, PSO reached a
joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the OCC, Oklahoma Attorney General’s office and customer groups. In
January 2020, SWEPCo reached a joint settlement agreement with the APSC, Arkansas Attorney General’s office and
Walmart, Inc. Hearings are scheduled for the first quarter of 2020. PSO and SWEPCo are seeking regulatory approvals
by July 2020.
The growth of AEP’s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify generation resources
to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs.  In addition to gradually
reducing AEP’s reliance on coal-fueled generating units, the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to
maintain a diversity of generation resources.
The integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by AEP’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect
AEP’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbon-constrained
world.  AEP has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new
resources.  Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 11,900 MWs of renewable energy
resources.  AEP’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional
renewable energy resources.
AEP Energy Supply, LLC is a holding company with several divisions, including AEP Renewables and AEP OnSite
Partners.
AEP Renewables develops, owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with
creditworthy counterparties throughout the United States.  AEP Renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure
that customers have clean, sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals.  As of December 31,
2019, AEP Renewables owned projects operating in 11 states, including approximately 1,212 MWs of installed wind
capacity and 90 MWs of installed solar capacity.  These figures include the 2019 addition of 724 MWs of wind
generation and battery assets located in several states acquired from Sempra Renewables LLC and the 75% interest, or
227 MWs, of Santa Rita East wind generation located in west Texas. In October 2019, AEP Renewables entered into an
agreement to construct Flat Ridge 3, a wind farm in Kansas.  The 128 MW facility is expected to reach commercial
operation before the end of 2020.
AEP OnSite Partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce
their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal
structuring capabilities.  AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power,
energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value
for customers.  AEP OnSite Partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers.  As
of December 31, 2019, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 17 states, including approximately 119 MWs of
installed solar capacity, and approximately 28 MWs of solar projects under construction.

End Use Energy Efficiency
AEP has reduced energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and
demand response programs.  These programs, commonly referred to as demand side management, were implemented in
jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available.  AEP’s operating companies’ programs have reduced
annual consumption by over 9 million MWhs and peak demand by approximately 2,806 MWs since 2008.  AEP
estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $1.5 billion during that period to achieve these levels.
Energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves.
Appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer
offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures
that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments.  As AEP continues to transition to
a cleaner, more efficient energy future, energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an
important role in how the company serves its customers. AEP believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency
programs in several states positions the company to be a cost-effective provider of these programs as states develop
their implementation plans.
Corporate Governance
In response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP’s strategic plan, the Board of
Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the
retirement of coal-fired generation assets. The Board of Directors is informed of any new environmental regulations
and proposed regulation or legislation that would significantly affect AEP.  The Board’s Committee on Directors and
Corporate Governance oversees AEP’s annual Corporate Accountability Report, which includes information about
AEP’s environmental, social, governance and financial performance. AEP set CO2 emission reduction goals in 2018
after considering input from corporate governance outreach effort with shareholders.
In September 2019, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals, based on the output
of the company’s integrated resource plans, which take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and
resiliency, regulations and the company’s current business strategy. The intermediate goal is a 70% reduction from 2000
CO2 emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030; the long-term goal is to surpass an 80% reduction of CO2
emissions from AEP generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050. AEP has made significant progress in reducing CO2
emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline. AEP’s aspirational emissions
goal is zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Technological advances, including energy storage, will determine how quickly
AEP can achieve zero emissions while continuing to provide reliable, affordable power for customers.
13
Other Environmental Issues and Matters
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for
environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of
hazardous material disposed of at such sites.  See “The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation” section of Note 6 included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional
information.
Environmental Investments
Investments related to improving AEP System plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water
quality standards during 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the current estimate for 2020 are shown below. These investments
include both environmental as well as other related spending. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to
periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental
regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends and the ability to access capital.  In addition to
the amounts set forth below, AEP expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the
modification and addition at generation plants’ facilities for environmental quality controls.  Such future investments
are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for
compliance after 2019 or have been proposed and may be adopted.  Future investments could be significantly greater if
emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more stringent. The cost of complying with
applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the AEP System. AEP typically
recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated
jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s
financial condition.  See “Environmental Issues” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2019
Annual Report for additional information.

Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts
of the environmental proposals. The following cost estimates for the years 2020 through 2026 will change depending
on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules.  These cost
estimates will also change based on: (a) the states’ implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential
for SIPs or FIPs that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court
decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for
new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired, replaced or
sold, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors. Management’s current ranges of

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
AEP’s Reportable Segments
AEP’s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated
Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated
basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers
are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP’s reportable segments are as follows:
•Vertically Integrated Utilities
•Transmission and Distribution Utilities
•AEP Transmission Holdco
•Generation & Marketing
The remainder of AEP’s activities is presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment.
See Note 9 - Business Segments included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information on AEP’s segments.
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES
GENERAL
AEP’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo,
PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.  AEPSC, as agent for AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation
dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these
subsidiaries.
ELECTRIC GENERATION
Facilities
As of December 31, 2019, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 22,000
MWs of domestic generation.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of
vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.
15
Fuel Supply
The following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type (including wind purchase agreements), on
an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:
 2019  2018 2017
Coal and Lignite 54%  58% 61%
Nuclear 19%  18% 18%
Natural Gas 16%  14% 11%
Renewables 11%  10% 10%
A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels, as well as the addition of renewable
resources, may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.  AEP’s overall 2019 fossil fuel costs for the
Vertically Integrated Utilities increased 2.4% on a dollar per MMBtu basis from 2018.
Coal and Lignite
AEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including
long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers, marketers and coal trading
firms.  Coal consumption in 2019 decreased approximately 18% from 2018 mainly due to lower dispatching of coal
generation from weaker power market prices.
 
Management believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of
adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units.  Through subsidiaries, AEP
owns, leases or controls more than 4,004 railcars, 468 barges, 8 towboats and a coal handling terminal with
approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities.
Spot market prices for coal started to weaken in the second half of 2019. The decreased spot coal prices reflect lower
demand for domestic and export coal. AEP’s strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time.  The
price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods and can occasionally cause current spot market prices to
be trending opposite to the price of coal delivered.  The price paid for coal delivered in 2019 increased approximately
6% from 2018.
The following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities’ plants during
the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:
 2019  2018 2017
Total coal delivered to the plants (millions of tons) 30.4 29.0 29.3
Average cost per ton of coal delivered $ 45.85 $ 43.21$ 44.24
The coal supplies at the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors,
including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space
limitations, plant coal consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which
may interrupt production or deliveries. As of December 31, 2019, the Vertically Integrated Utilities’ coal inventory was
approximately 54 days of full load burn. While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current
coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 30 days of full load burn.
Natural Gas
The Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed approximately 117 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2019 for
generating power. This represents an increase of 5% from 2018.  Total gas consumption for the Vertically Integrated
Utilities was higher year over year primarily due to lower natural gas prices. Several of AEP’s natural gas-fired power
plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery
reliability. A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas
16
requirements for each plant, as appropriate. AEP’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive
basis and based on market prices.
The following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities’ plants during the
past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities.
 2019  2018 2017
Total natural gas delivered to the plants (billion of cubic feet) 117.0 111.6 86.3
Average price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas $ 2.64 $ 3.26$ 3.37
Nuclear
I&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant.  I&M has made and will
make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.  I&M also continues to
finance its nuclear fuel through leasing.
For purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of SNF, I&M completed modifications to its
SNF storage pool in the early 1990’s.  I&M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of SNF to
permit normal operations to continue.  I&M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an
ongoing periodic basis. 
Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning
As the owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and
decommission and decontaminate the plant safely.  The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC
regulations and the SNF disposal program.  The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2018.  The
estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $2 billion in
2018 non-discounted dollars, with additional ongoing estimated costs of $6 million per year for post decommissioning
storage of SNF and an eventual estimated cost of $37 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel
storage facility, also in 2018 non-discounted dollars. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total decommissioning
trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The balance of
funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns.  The
ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the:
• Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy).
• Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning.
• Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies.
• Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities.
• Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of SNF.
Accordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will
not be significantly different than current projections.  AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates
if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections.  See the “Nuclear Contingencies” section of Note 6 -
Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2019 Annual Report for information with respect to
nuclear waste and decommissioning.
17
Low-Level Radioactive Waste
The Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive
waste rests with the individual states.  Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items
that have come in contact with radioactive materials.  Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste
available.  I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However, the states of Utah and Texas have licensed
low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from Michigan waste
generators.  There is currently no set date limiting I&M’s access to either of these facilities.  The Cook Plant has a
facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste.  In the event that low level
radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, it can be stored onsite at this facility.
Counterparty Risk Management
The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale
customers and other market participants. As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related
instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31, 2019, counterparties
posted approximately $13 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP’s
public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately $24 million
with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various
commodities, exposures change daily.  See the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section
of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2019
Annual Report for additional information.
Certain Power Agreements
I&M
The UPA between AEGCo and I&M, dated March 31, 1982, provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the capacity
(and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant.  Whether or not power is available
from AEGCo, I&M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and an energy charge for
any associated energy taken by I&M).  The agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of Unit 2
of the Rockport Plant have expired (currently December 2022) unless extended in specified circumstances.
Pursuant to an assignment between I&M and KPCo, and a UPA between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30%
of the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant.  KPCo
has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I&M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the UPA between
AEGCo and I&M for such entitlement.  The KPCo UPA expires in December 2022.
OVEC
AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.  The aggregate equity participation of AEP in
OVEC is 43.47%.  Parent owns 39.17% and OPCo owns 4.3%.  Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA),
which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are
entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their
respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. 
The ICPA terminates in June 2040.  The proceeds from charges by OVEC to sponsoring companies under the ICPA
based on their prower participation ratios are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and
fixed costs.  OVEC’s Board of Directors, as elected by AEP and the other owners, has authorized environmental
investments related to their ownership interests, with resulting expenses (including for related debt and interest thereon)
included in charges under the ICPA. OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion in connection with flue
gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through
debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances.  Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the new
environmental controls in service.  OPCo attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the ICPA to an affiliate
18
as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by Ohio law. 
OPCo failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of OVEC and therefore filed a request with the
PUCO seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of OVEC. In December 2013, the PUCO approved OPCo’s
request, subject to the condition that energy from the OVEC entitlements are sold into the day-ahead or real-time PJM
energy markets, or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangement.  In November 2016, the PUCO approved
OPCo’s request to approve a cost-based purchased power agreement (PPA) rider, effective in January 2017, that would
initially be based upon OPCo’s contractual entitlement under the ICPA which is approximately 20% of OVEC’s
capacity. In January 2020, provisions enacted as part of Ohio Am. Sub. H.B. 6 went into effect that replace the PPA
rider and enable OPCo to continue recovering the net cost associated with the ICPA, including any additional
contractual entitlement received as a result of the FirstEnergy Solutions (FES) bankruptcy, through 2030.
In March 2018, FES, with an aggregate power participation ratio of approximately 5% under the ICPA, filed
bankruptcy. In July 2018, the Bankruptcy Court granted FES’s motion to reject the ICPA. OVEC appealed this decision
in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and in December 2019 the Sixth Circuit remanded the
rejection of the ICPA back to the Bankruptcy Court for further consideration based on reversing the Bankruptcy Court’s
application of the business judgment standard in rejecting the ICPA. If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor
its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their
power participation ratio payments.  Further, if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that
APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to
their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%. The foregoing and other related actions have adversely impacted
the credit ratings of OVEC.
ELECTRIC DELIVERY
General
Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution
lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the
transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of
AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved
by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC.  See
Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Regulation – Rates.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for
both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts.  The use and the recovery of costs
associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the
rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and SPP, and as approved by the FERC. See Item 1.
Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Regulation – FERC.  As discussed below, some transmission services also
are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies.
Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide
electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the
utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory.  These franchises have varying
provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the
conduct of their business.  For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business – Vertically
Integrated Utilities – Competition.
Transmission Agreement (TA)
APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission
service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA.  OPCo, which is a subsidiary in AEP’s Transmission and
Distribution Utilities segment that provides transmission service under the PJM OATT, is also a party to the TA.  The
TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the
costs of transmission service provided by PJM.  The TA has been approved by the FERC.
19
TCA and OATT
PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA.  Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the
responsibility of (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement,
including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent
system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the
OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff.  Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has
responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the
other parties to the agreement.  The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for
transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT.  These allocations have been determined by the FERC-
approved OATT for the SPP.
Regional Transmission Organizations
AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP
(both FERC-approved RTOs).  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to
provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission
assets and those that do not.
REGULATION
General
AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional
cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions.  AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also
subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission
service transactions.  I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with
respect to the operation of the Cook Plant.  AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject
to the regulatory provisions of, much of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which is administered by the FERC.
Rates
Historically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is
designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its
investment used in providing that service.  A utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including
operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  State utility commissions periodically adjust rates
pursuant to a review of (a) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility’s
level of investment.  Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for
a period of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative.  Some states may initiate
reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers.  Such parties
may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.
Public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service.  Provided the
asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate
recovery.  Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets,
management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow.  AEP
representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce
regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process.  These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work
in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates.
The rates of AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing
traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service).  Historically, the state
regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified
fuel costs
20
as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and
tariffs.  Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide
protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.
The following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which
AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate.  Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than
one jurisdiction.  See Note 4 - Rate Matters included in the 2019 Annual Report for more information regarding
pending rate matters.
Indiana
I&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of-
service basis.  Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery
mechanism.
Oklahoma
PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC.  PSO’s rates are set on a cost-
of-service basis.  Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other
factors to retail kilowatt-hour sales.
Virginia
APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by
the Virginia SCC.  Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause.  In
addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment
clauses including transmission services provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.
West Virginia
APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined
cost-of-service basis.  West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy
cost which trues-up to actual expenses.
FERC
The FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other
matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects.  The FERC regulations require AEP’s vertically
integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and AEP has
approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at the FERC.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission
service to retail customers.  In addition, the FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by (a)
approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and (b) granting authority to public
utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly
influence market prices.  AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from
the FERC, under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place.  The FERC requires each public utility
that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and
point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission
system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access
Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and
prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from
providing non-public transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees. Additionally, the vertically
integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation, with the approval of the FERC.
21
The FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets.  AEGCo, APCo,
I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM.  PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP.
The FERC has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition
of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or
holding company.  In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any
company within a holding company system.
COMPETITION
Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate, transmit and distribute electricity to
retail customers of AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are
made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances,
approved by the FERC, and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities.  Other than
AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the
exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  
AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy
sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such
competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other
than electric power. With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP
believe that they currently maintain a competitive position. 
Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells,
microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making
them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular
have continued to become increasingly competitive. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable
operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP’s
competitiveness.
SEASONALITY
The consumption of electric power is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during
the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the
winter.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP’s facilities and the terms of
power sale contracts into which AEP enters.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned
less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP’s results of
operations. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations.
22
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES
GENERAL
This segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers
through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo. OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of
electric power to approximately 1,494,000 retail customers in Ohio.  OPCo purchases energy and capacity at auction to
serve generation service customers who have not switched to a competitive generation supplier. AEP Texas is engaged
in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,049,000 retail customers through REPs in
west, central and southern Texas.
AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other
facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2 – Properties, for more information regarding the transmission and
distribution lines.  Transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP’s transmission and
distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for AEP
Texas and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale
transmission transactions.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated
companies.
AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in
various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the
exclusive right to provide electric service.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general,
the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.
The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution
utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved
by the FERC.  In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas,
AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies
through RTOs.
Transmission Agreement
OPCo owns and operates transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT;
OPCo is a party to the TA with other utility subsidiary affiliates. The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share
the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM. The
TA has been approved by the FERC.
Regional Transmission Organizations
OPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO.  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets to
provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission
assets and those that do not.  AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT.
REGULATION
OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates
approved by the PUCO or by the FERC.  AEP Texas provides transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service
basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent
with PUCT rules.  Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to
allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment
used in providing that service.  The cost of service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and
maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a
review of: (a) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility’s level of
investment.
23
FERC
The FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters.  The FERC regulations
require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and it has approved cost-based
formula transmission rates on file at the FERC.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail
customers.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or
through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to
the utility’s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through
an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission
information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that
prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility’s marketing
employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any
company within a holding company system. Additionally, the transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are
subject to reliability standards as set forth by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of
the FERC.
SEASONALITY
The delivery of electric power is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the
hot summer months.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation
may change due to the nature and location of AEP’s transmission and distribution facilities.  In addition, AEP
transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather
conditions are milder.  In Texas, and to a lesser extent, in Ohio, where there is residential decoupling, unusually mild
weather in the future could diminish AEP’s results of operations.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions
could increase AEP’s results of operations.
24
AEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO
GENERAL
AEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the State Transcos and (b)
AEP’s Transmission Joint Ventures.
AEPTCo
AEPTCo wholly owns the State Transcos which are independent of, but respectively overlay, the following AEP
electric utility operating companies: APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo, and WPCo. The State Transcos
develop, own, operate, and maintain their respective transmission assets. Assets of the State Transcos interconnect to
transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and nonaffiliated transmission owners within
the footprints of PJM, MISO and SPP. APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, and WVTCo are located within PJM. IMTCo
also owns portions of the Greentown station assets located in MISO. OKTCo and SWTCo are located within SPP.
IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo, and WVTCo own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions. 
The Virginia SCC and WVPSC granted consent for APCo and APTCo to enter into a joint license agreement that will
support APTCo investment in the state of Tennessee. SWTCo does not currently own or operate transmission assets.
The State Transcos are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff
rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems.  The State Transcos establish transmission rates each
year through formula rate filings with the FERC.  The rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the
costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed ROE.  These rates are then included in an OATT for PJM,
MISO and SPP.
The State Transcos own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance
system integrity and grid reliability, grid security, safety, reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections
of new generating resources and new wholesale customers, as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity
markets. A key part of AEP’s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities, assets and components of the
existing AEP System as needed to maintain reliability.
The State Transcos provide the capability to build, replace and upgrade existing facilities. As of December 31, 2019,
the State Transcos had $8.4 billion of transmission and other assets in-service with plans to construct approximately
$4.3 billion of additional transmission assets through 2022. Additional investment in transmission infrastructure is
needed within PJM and SPP to maintain the required level of grid reliability, resiliency, security and efficiency and to
address an aging transmission infrastructure. Additional transmission facilities will be needed based on changes in
generating resources, such as wind or solar projects, generation additions or retirements, and additional new customer
interconnections.  The State Transcos will continue their investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets,
and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid.
25
AEPTHCO JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES
AEP has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building, and
owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to

Transource Energy, LLC (Transource).  Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. formed to pursue competitive transmission
projects.  AEPTHCo and Evergy, Inc. own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively.
(e) In August 2016, Transource Maryland and Transource Pennsylvania received approval from the PJM Interconnection Board to construct portions of a
transmission project located in both Maryland and Pennsylvania. The project is expected to go in service in 2022. Project costs are in 2019 dollars.
Transource Missouri, Transource West Virginia, Transource Maryland and Transource Pennsylvania are consolidated
joint ventures by AEP.  All other joint ventures in the table above are not consolidated by AEP. AEP’s joint ventures do
not have employees.  Business services for the joint ventures are provided by AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and
the joint venture partners. During 2019, approximately 608 AEPSC employees and 291 operating company employees
provided service to one or more joint ventures.
26
REGULATION
The State Transcos and the Transmission Joint Ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates
annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation
protocols.  The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are
prudently incurred and reasonably calculated. The IMTCo-owned Greentown station assets acquired from Duke Energy
Indiana, LLC in December 2018 are located in MISO. IMTCo utilizes a historic cost recovery model to recover MISO
assets.
The State Transcos’ and the Transmission Joint Ventures’ (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT
for PJM and SPP.  An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and
related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system.  The FERC requires transmission providers such as
PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power
marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis.
The FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission
service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the FERC.  The formula rates establish rates for a
one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe.  The formula
rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous year’s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the
transmission owner’s ATRR.  PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill
transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the
respective OATT for the service taken. Additionally, the State Transcos are subject to reliability standards promulgated
by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of the FERC.
The authorized returns on equity for the State Transcos are the FERC-authorized returns on equity in the PJM and SPP
OATTs, respectively. These returns were challenged by parties in filings before the FERC. AEP’s transmission owning
subsidiaries within PJM entered into a settlement agreement, approved by the FERC in May 2019, that established a
total ROE of 9.85% (10.35% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%) based on a capital structure of up to 55%
equity for APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo and WVTCo (the East Transcos).  In June 2019, the FERC approved an
unopposed settlement agreement between AEP’s transmission owning subsidiaries within SPP that established a total
ROE of 10.0% (10.5% inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 0.5%) without a cap on the capital structure for OKTCo
and SWTCo (the West Transcos).
In the annual rate base filings described above, the State Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $5.9 billion, $4.6
billion and $3.8 billion for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The total filed transmission revenue requirements,
including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges were $992 million, $829 million
and $690 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
The rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT.  ETT sets its rates through a combination
of base rate cases and interim Transmission Cost of Services (TCOS) filings.  ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-
annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.
The Transmission Joint Ventures have approved ROEs ranging from 9.6% to 12.8% based on equity capital structures
ranging from 40% to 60%.
27
GENERATION & MARKETING
GENERAL
The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive generating assets, a wholesale energy
trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business.  The primary fossil generation
subsidiary in the Generation & Marketing segment is AGR.  As of December 31, 2019, AGR owns 1,294 MWs of
generating capacity. Management plans to close 51% of this generation capacity in May 2020. Almost all of the
remaining generating capacity is operated by Buckeye Power, a nonaffiliated electric cooperative. Other subsidiaries in
this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets.  See Item 2 – Properties for
more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation & Marketing segment. AGR is a competitive
generation subsidiary.
With respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business, AEP Generation & Marketing segment
subsidiaries enter into short-term and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in
ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM.  These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power, natural gas and
emissions allowances risk management and trading activities.  These activities primarily involve the purchase-and-sale
of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and
variable prices.  These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, OTC
swaps and options.  The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts.  These
transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.
With respect to the retail supply and energy management business, AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies
electricity and/or natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.  AEP Energy provides various energy
solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C.  AEP Energy also
provides demand-side management solutions nationwide.  AEP Energy had approximately 470,000 customer accounts
as of December 31, 2019.
AEP Energy Supply, LLC is a holding company with several divisions, including AEP Renewables and AEP OnSite
Partners.
AEP Renewables develops, owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with
creditworthy counterparties throughout the United States.  AEP Renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure
that customers have clean, sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals.  As of December 31,
2019, AEP Renewables owned projects operating in 11 states, including approximately 1,212 MWs of installed wind
capacity and approximately 90 MWs of installed solar capacity.  These figures include the 2019 addition of 724 MWs
of wind generation and battery assets located in several states acquired from Sempra Renewables LLC and the 75%
interest, or 227 MWs, of Santa Rita East wind generation located in west Texas. In October 2019, AEP Renewables
entered into an agreement to construct Flat Ridge 3, a wind farm in Kansas.  The 128 MW facility is expected to reach
commercial operation before the end of 2020.
AEP OnSite Partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce
their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal
structuring capabilities.  AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power,
energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value
for customers.  AEP OnSite Partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers.  As
of December 31, 2019, AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 17 states, including approximately 119 MWs of
installed solar capacity, and approximately 28 MWs of solar projects under construction.
28
REGULATION
AGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act, and is subject to the FERC’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction
over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power
Act, the FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services
to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable.  The FERC granted AGR market-based rate authority in December
2013.  The FERC’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of AGR
and set cost-based rates if the FERC subsequently determines that it can exercise market power, create barriers to entry
or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Periodically, AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it
continues to meet the FERC’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate
whether it continues to qualify for market-based rates.  Other matters subject to the FERC jurisdiction include, but are
not limited to, review of mergers, and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another
public utility or an existing operational generating facility.
Specific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal, state, regional and local
agencies, including federal and state environmental protection agencies.  AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for
transactions inside ERCOT.  Additionally, AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North
American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of the FERC. 
COMPETITION
The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and
ancillary services.  The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or
retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Because most of AGR’s
remaining generation is coal-fired, lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher
concentration of natural gas fueled generation.  Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental
regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or
inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities.
Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant
natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that
impact competition for AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment. AGR also competes with self-generation and with
distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The
primary factors in such competition are price, unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of
energy other than electric power.
Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells,
microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making
them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient
and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of
AGR’s competitiveness. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly
competitive.
This segment’s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in
six states and Washington, D.C. Each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing
its competitive market, and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect
customer participation in retail competition. Sustained low natural gas and power prices, low market volatility and
maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business.
This segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under long-term
contracts to creditworthy counterparties.  New sources are not acquired without first securing a long-term placement of
such power.  Existing sources do not face competitive exposure.  Competitive nonaffiliated suppliers of renewable or
other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts. 
29
SEASONALITY
The consumption of electric power is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during
the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the
winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change.
Fuel Supply
The following table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the
Generation & Marketing segment, not including AEP Energy Partners’ offtake agreement from the Oklaunion Power
Station:
2019 2018  2017
Coal 64% 88%  85%
Natural Gas —% —%  8%
Renewables 36% 12%  7%
 
Management expects the decline in coal generation sources to continue into 2020 due to the shutdown of Conesville
Unit 4 in May 2020.
Coal and Consumables
AGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements
including long-term and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms.  As contracts expire, they are
replaced, as needed, with contracts at market prices. Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet
generation requirements.
Management believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in
adequate quantities to operate their coal-fired units.  AGR, through its contracts with third party transporters, has the
ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities. AGR plants consumed 2.5
million tons of coal in 2019.
The coal supplies at AGR plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to,
demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal
consumption rates, coal quality, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may
interrupt production or deliveries. AGR aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 20 to
60 days of full load burn.  As of December 31, 2019, the coal inventory of AGR was within the target range.
Counterparty Risk Management
Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as
margin against open positions.  As of December 31, 2019, counterparties posted approximately $16 million in cash,
cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries
(while, as of that date, AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately $169 million with
counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities,
exposures change daily.  See the “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2019 Annual
Report for additional information.
Certain Power Agreements
As of December 31, 2019, the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 1,212 MWs of company-owned
domestic wind power facilities, 101 MWs of domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements and 355
MWs of coal-fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers the interest
of AEP Texas in the Oklaunion Power Station to AEPEP.  Management has announced plans to close Oklaunion Power
Station by October 2020. The power obtained from the Oklaunion Power Station is marketed and sold in ERCOT.

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS
GENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS
AEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions.
(Applies to all Registrants)
AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of
environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing
infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved
by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates
charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would
cause financial results to be diminished.
Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability
to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)
The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective
state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia and West Virginia. In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated
settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval. AEP cannot predict the ultimate
outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.
If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be
subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings. Additionally, if
regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future
net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief
authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory
action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an
impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved. See Note 4 – Rate
Matters included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information.
AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies
to all Registrants)
A significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently
favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt
a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as
projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with
transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing
authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance
that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  
Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates
and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)
AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula
rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved
the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of AEP’s rates
accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion
of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested
parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative. In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual
32
implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula
rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols. If a challenger can establish that any of these
aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate
prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.
AEP settled challenges to its SPP and PJM formula rates in proceedings at the FERC in 2019.  However, inquiries
related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at
the FERC.  The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP’s
formula rates.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates,
it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.
End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government
and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered
electricity increase substantially.
Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises.
(Applies to all Registrants)
AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its
transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results
in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and
distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes
(LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies
and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new
technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery. 
These developments can challenge AEP’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable
operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to
customers.  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through
legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such
resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market
participants sell their electricity.
  
AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)
AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays,
nonperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the
risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts
and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or
environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary
regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment
purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been
recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.
AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)
I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,288 MWs, or about
7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear
generation, which include the following:
•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting
from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as
SNF.
33
•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in
connection with nuclear operations.
•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law
requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and
potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).
•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the
end of their licensed lives.
There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are
triggered.
The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of
nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a
unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised
safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In
addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident
did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in
the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a
major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.
Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more
significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing
regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in
the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end
of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and
retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not
assured.
AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various
regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)
Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power
markets.  The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which
could affect costs or revenues.  Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees
and increased costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to
changes in transmission rate design. In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission
reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights. As members of these RTOs, AEP’s
subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused
by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds
of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.
AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all
Registrants)
Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated
by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the
functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and
market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs
and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers
through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a
timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be
subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers
through regulated rates.
34
A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or
default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. (Applies to
AEP and AEP Texas)
AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to
its customers. As of December 31, 2019, AEP Texas did business with approximately 120 REPs. Adverse economic
conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could
impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments. AEP Texas
depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be
shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations
significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit
protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at
risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. In 2019,
AEP Texas’ first, second and third largest REPs accounted for 20%, 14% and 14%, respectively, of its operating
revenue. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of
operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under
the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made
by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.
RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS
AEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform
certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)
Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution
facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:
• Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.
• Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.
• Labor disputes.
• Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.
• Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal
business operations.
• Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of
confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to
legal claims.
• Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought,
non-performance by suppliers and other factors.
• Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism
(including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.
• Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.
Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of
confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)
AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of
generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading. AEP and its regulated
utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information
technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external
networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer
systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the
collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to
electronic theft or loss.
35
A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected
entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission
and distribution system or subject AEP and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or
inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other
confidential data. A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other
assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. The breach
of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major
cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and
could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation. In
addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data
could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these
reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial
condition.
If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows
and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)
AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by
operating cash flows.  Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect
AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing
maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in
companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels. If sources of capital for AEP are reduced, capital costs could increase
materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and
cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
Shareholder activis m could cause AEP  to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP’ s business
strategy and impact AEP’ s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)
Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs
and divert management’s and AEP’s board’s attention and resources from AEP’s business. Additionally, such
shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP’s future, adversely affect AEP’s relationships
with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including
for third-party advisors. AEP’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected
by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.
The potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing. (Applies
to all Registrants)
A portion of the Registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London
interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits of U.S. dollars. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates,
rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London
interbank market and general economic conditions. Accordingly, Registrants’ interest expense for any particular period
will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the
authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation
of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it
continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates
Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Funding Rate, which is calculated
based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes,
other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.
To the extent these interest rates increase, interest expense will increase. If sources of capital for the Registrants are
reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs
could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition and/or liquidity.
36
Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)
The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash
flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for
operations.  Recently a credit rating agency placed AEP’s credit rating on negative outlook primarily because a key
criterion, the ratio of cash flow from operations (excluding working capital) to debt, is expected to decline due to higher
capital spending and lower cash flows resulting from changes in tax law.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP
is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s
ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce
future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
AEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their
subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)
AEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own.  Their ability to meet their financial
obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash
flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay
dividends to, or repay loans from them.  Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no
obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether
by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent
upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally
subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.
AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather
conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)
Electric power consumption is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the
hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the
winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition,
AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are
milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact
financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a
manner that would not likely be sustainable.
Further, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in
reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production
entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing
economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning. (Applies to all Registrants
and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)
The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the
rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding
levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and the
frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial
assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of
investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan
liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to
fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on
liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.
37
Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to
decommission its nuclear plant. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs
of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.
AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the
number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants)
Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need
for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number
of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals,
distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and
income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.
Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further
reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of
technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the
demand for electricity.
Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all
Registrants)
Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to
future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The
challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill
development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety
costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant
internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor
may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain
an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.
Changes in the price of commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the
costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all
Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)
AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price
and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these
contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current
contracts.  The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior
to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can
be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs. Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and
availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions
achieved through emission controls and other measures.  Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect,
AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and
beyond.  If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional
costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP
needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental
programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel
which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.
Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of
fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of
power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
38
In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value
trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are
marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.
AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)
Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea
level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as
fires.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential
customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by
climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the
changes.
Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission
and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial
condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to
costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the
AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system
needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other
systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase
the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.
Severe weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes,
hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events and storms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, and these costs may not be
recoverable.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations,
principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or
severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price
they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.
To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial
performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s
cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of
the communities within the AEP System.
Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to
all Registrants)
AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of
which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2019 Annual
Report.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net
income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.
Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and
distribution services. (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)
AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by
third-parties. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and
distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows
could be adversely affected.
39
Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the
imposition of civil or criminal penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)
AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including
explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment
interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other
environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property
and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or
criminal penalties. AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential
hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.
AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues. (Applies to AEPTCo)
AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System. Management expects that these
affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future. For the year
ended December 31, 2019, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission
revenues of AEPTCo.
Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements
and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates. (Applies to AEPTCo)
AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located.
Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real
property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations. The ability of AEPTCo to
continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying
real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar
encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property. AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP
System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained
in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and
other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.
RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER
Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas,
AEPTCo and OPCo)
Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air
quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity
generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides,
mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or “CCR”)
resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses. 
Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental
monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal and permits at AEP facilities and could
cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance with
environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition,
especially if emission, CCR waste and/or discharge obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or
permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers
expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated
operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs
associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly
harm financial condition. 
40
Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric
generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo
and OPCo)
In 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for new, modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the
development of SIPs that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units. The standards and guidelines were
finalized in 2015, and were challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders. The
U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan,
while the courts considered those challenges. In 2017, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power
Plan, and in 2018, the Federal EPA proposed new guidelines that would allow states to establish unit-specific
performance standards based on their evaluation of past performance and whether certain efficiency improvement
measures could be applied at existing coal-fired units. The Federal EPA also proposed to change the new source
performance standard for new coal-fired utility units to 1,900 - 2,000 pounds per MWh depending on the size of the
unit, an increase from the current standard of 1,400 pounds per MWh, based on its determination that carbon capture
and storage is not available everywhere and is not sufficiently cost-effective to be considered the best available control
technology for coal-fired units. The new guidelines were finalized in 2019, and the Clean Power Plan was repealed.
Challenges to both of these actions are pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
CO2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates
for retirement of AEP’s coal-fired units. While AEP typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements, such
as the potential CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers, there can be no assurance that
AEP would recover such costs.
Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or
reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)
In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law
nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the
defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of
damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s
existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to
fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on revenues.  In
addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing
of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  Unless recovered, those costs could reduce
future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position
could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.
Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but
not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)
AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management
of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or
diminish financial results and financial position.
AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s
power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed
to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.
In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options,
OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price
movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial
position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.
41
Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of
operations. (Applies to all Registrants)
AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a
contractual basis. AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and
coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations. AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that
owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the
counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements
or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would
cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected
probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates
predict.
AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide
AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers
of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)
AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the
power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or
transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power
transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive
transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in
expansion of transmission infrastructure.
The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled
from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to
transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or
because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be
expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.
OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo)
AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the
rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to
receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective
power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails
to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations,
including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, OVEC has outstanding
indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $589
million through the ICPA. Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for
their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA.
FirstEnergy Solutions (“FES”), a nonaffiliated party, whose aggregate power participation ratio is 4.85% under the
ICPA, has filed a petition seeking protection under bankruptcy law. Litigation related to these filings continues. In
addition, as a result of these and prior related developments, OVEC’s credit ratings have been adversely impacted.
 
If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo
may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments.  Further, if OVEC’s indebtedness is
accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such
accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.  Also, as a result of
the credit rating agencies’ actions, OVEC’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may
diminish and its financing costs will increase.

TITLE TO PROPERTY
The AEP System’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple.  The greater portion of the
transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to
easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority.  The rights of AEP’s public
utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of
their business.  Minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may
exist, but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties.  AEP’s public utility
subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them, if necessary, to acquire, perfect or secure
titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations.  Legislation in Ohio and
Virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes.
SYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING
Laws in the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West
Virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities and/or routes of high-voltage transmission lines.  AEP
has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to
such statutes and in proceedings in which AEP’s operating companies have sought to acquire rights-of-way through
condemnation.  These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years.
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
With input from its state utility commissions, the AEP System continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission,
distribution, generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its
customers.  In this assessment process, assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes
available and assessments and plans are modified, as appropriate.  AEP forecasts approximately $6.3 billion of
construction expenditures for 2020. Capital expenditures related to North Central Wind Energy Facilities are excluded
from this budgeted amount. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and
may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities,
market volatility, economic trends, weather and the ability to access capital.  See the “Budgeted Capital Expenditures”
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the
2019 Annual Report for additional information.
POTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES
Some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to
meet potential losses and liabilities, including liabilities relating to damage to AEP’s generation plants and costs of
replacement power.  Unless allowed to be recovered through rates, future losses or liabilities which are not completely
insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and other AEP System companies.  For
risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit, see the “Nuclear Contingencies” section of Note 6 - Commitments,
Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information.

ITEM 4.   MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) imposes stringent health and safety standards on various
mining operations. The Mine Act and its related regulations affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including
training of mine personnel, mining procedures, equipment used in mine emergency procedures, mine plans and other
matters. SWEPCo, through its ownership of Dolet Hills Lignite Company (DHLC), a wholly-owned lignite mining
subsidiary of SWEPCo, is subject to the provisions of the Mine Act.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires companies that operate
mines to include in their periodic reports filed with the SEC, certain mine safety information covered by the Mine
Act.  Exhibit 95 “Mine Safety Disclosure Exhibit” contains the notices of violation and proposed assessments received
by DHLC under the Mine Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.

Basis of Presentation
The condensed financial information of Parent is required as a result of the restricted net assets of AEP consolidated
subsidiaries exceeding 25% of AEP consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2019.  Parent is a public utility holding
company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of
other subsidiaries, including joint ventures and equity investments.  The primary source of income for Parent is equity
in its subsidiaries’ earnings.  Its major source of cash is dividends from the subsidiaries.  Parent borrows the funds for
the money pool that is used by the subsidiaries for their short-term cash needs.
Income Taxes
Parent files a consolidated federal income tax return with its subsidiaries.  AEP System’s current consolidated federal
income tax is allocated to AEP System companies so that their current tax expense reflects a separate return result for
each company in the consolidated group.  The tax benefit of Parent is allocated to its subsidiaries with taxable income.
2.  COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES
Parent and its subsidiaries are parties to environmental and other legal matters.  For further discussion, see Note 6 -

4.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Payments on Behalf of Subsidiaries
Due to occasional time sensitivity and complexity of payments, Parent makes certain insurance, tax and benefit
payments on behalf of subsidiary companies.  Parent is then fully reimbursed by the subsidiary companies.
Short-term Lending to Subsidiaries
Parent uses a commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of subsidiaries.  The program is used
to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds
certain nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt
requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational
reasons.  The program also allows some direct borrowers to invest excess cash with Parent.
Interest expense related to Parent’s short-term borrowing is included in Interest Expense on Parent’s statements of
income.  Parent incurred interest expense for amounts borrowed from subsidiaries of $8 million, $11 million and $8
million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest income related to Parent’s short-term lending is included in Interest Income on Parent’s statements of
income.  Parent earned interest income for amounts advanced to subsidiaries of $49 million, $27 million and $16
million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Affiliated Notes
Parent issued long-term debt, portions of which were loaned to its subsidiaries.  Parent pays interest on the affiliated
notes, but the subsidiaries accrue interest for their share of the affiliated borrowing and remit the interest to
Parent.  Interest income related to Parent’s loans to subsidiaries is included in Interest Income on Parent’s statements of
income.  Parent earned interest income on loans to subsidiaries of $2 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The condensed financial information of AEPTCo Parent is required as a result of the restricted net assets of AEPTCo
consolidated subsidiaries exceeding 25% of AEPTCo consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2019.  AEPTCo
Parent is the direct holding company for the seven State Transcos.  The primary source of income for AEPTCo Parent is
equity in its subsidiaries’ earnings. AEPTCo Parent financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
AEPTCo consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. For purposes of these condensed
financial statements, AEPTCo wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries are recorded based upon its
proportionate share of the subsidiaries’ net assets (similar to presenting them on the equity method).
Income Taxes
AEPTCo Parent joins in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with its affiliates in the AEP System.  The
allocation of the AEP System’s current consolidated federal income tax to the AEP System companies allocates the
benefit of current tax losses (“Parent Company Loss Benefit”) to the AEP System companies giving rise to such losses
in determining their current tax expense.  The consolidated net operating loss of the AEP System is allocated to each
company in the consolidated group with taxable losses. The tax benefit of AEP Parent is allocated to its subsidiaries
with taxable income. With the exception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System net operating loss, the loss of
the AEP Parent and tax credits, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the
consolidated group.

Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2019 Annual Report.
