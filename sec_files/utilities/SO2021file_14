The Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating
facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources
of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of
the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission
system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System – Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power"
herein.
Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered
into from time to time for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have
entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and
periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission
I-1
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk
power supply. The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to
augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies
are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Southern Company recently joined a filing at the FERC
proposing a Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) that includes many of the electric service providers in the Southeast.
SEEM is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants would use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to
buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. If approved by the FERC,
SEEM is expected to begin service in early 2022. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated
as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are
administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The
fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an
effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service
requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized
economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost
energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use
in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern
Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations
thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions
with third parties. In connection with the sale of former subsidiary Gulf Power in January 2019, an appendix was added to the IIC
setting forth terms and conditions governing Gulf Power's continued participation in the IIC for a defined transition period that,
subject to certain potential adjustments, is scheduled to end on January 1, 2024.
Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are
furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's
existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to
develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation – Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional
information.
Southern Power
Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy and
battery energy storage projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market.
Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions,
dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs,
including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid,
primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as
commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is
primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the
traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel
transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs.
However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its
wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct
generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric
operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on
Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – OVERVIEW – "Business
Activities" in Item 7 herein.
Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the
Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company
power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue natural gas and renewable generation facilities either
wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2020, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in
part with various partners, totaled 11,920 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 4,540 MWs of nameplate
capacity owned by its subsidiaries). See "Traditional Electric Operating Companies" herein for additional information on the
Southern Company power pool.
I-2
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at
differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling member and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the
partnerships. At December 31, 2020, Southern Power had six tax-equity partnership arrangements where the tax-equity investors
receive substantially all of the tax benefits from the facilities, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power holds
controlling interests in eight partnerships in solar facilities through SP Solar. For seven of these solar partnerships, Southern Power
and its 33% partner, Global Atlantic, are entitled to 51% of all cash distributions and the respective partner that holds the Class B
membership interests is entitled to 49% of all cash distributions. For the Desert Stateline partnership, Southern Power and Global
Atlantic are entitled to 66% of all cash distributions and the Class B member is entitled to 34% of all cash distributions. In addition,
Southern Power and Global Atlantic are entitled to substantially all of the federal tax benefits with respect to these eight partnership
entities.
See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional
information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners,
based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or
expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated
with the facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment
coverage ratio at December 31, 2020 was 94% through 2025 and 91% through 2030, with an average remaining contract duration
of approximately 14 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 69% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or
equivalent rated counterparties, 21% were with BBB+ to BBB- or equivalent rated counterparties, and 8% were either with unrated
entities that have ratemaking authority or those who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two
types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all
or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit
or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern
Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from
Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the
requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to
recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on
investment.
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind (renewable) generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs;
however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated
renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a
result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of
energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission
constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or
resell the renewable energy credits.
Southern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues
attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's
current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's
earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through
the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to
the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. Southern
Company Gas also has an "all other" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
disclosure, including storage operations and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note
15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas'
dispositions during 2020.
Gas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains
approximately 75,924 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas
to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves approximately 4.3 million customers across
four states.
I-3
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Gas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG, a
20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline project, and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural

Fuel Supply
Electric
The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal.
Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
– RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Southern Company – Electricity Business – Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" and
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION under "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses"
for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the
average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2019 and 2020.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the
natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2021, SCS has contracted for 574 Bcf of natural gas supply
under agreements with remaining terms up to 13 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm
natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation,
and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.
The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their
2021 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications,
emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to
remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the
utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to
evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control
equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein for additional information.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services,
enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 14 years. Management believes suppliers have
sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the
permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in
rate schedules. See "Rate Matters – Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's
natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.
Natural Gas
Advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural
gas and low prices for natural gas. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers
are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas
purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for the natural gas distribution
utilities other than Nicor Gas, from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sequent, under asset management agreements approved by the
applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate
pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may
release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release

provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas charged to customers for most of
the natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of company-owned storage facilities,
pipeline transportation capacity, purchased storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply sources, arranged by either
transportation customers or Southern Company Gas.

Competition
Electric
The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. The competition for
retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological
advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and
environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.
The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973.
Pursuant to standards set forth in this Act, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier.
Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a
connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the
supplier of its choice.
Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to
Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part
by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The
six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas
included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to
certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may
not be made unless the Mississippi PSC grants a CPCN. Areas included in a CPCN that are subsequently annexed to municipalities
may continue to be served by the holder of the CPCN, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On
the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by
the Mississippi PSC.
Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their
respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as
self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors.
Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility
markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success
in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants,
availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.
As of December 31, 2020, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with seven industrial customers. Under the terms of
these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2020, Alabama Power purchased
approximately 107 million KWHs from such companies at a cost of $3 million.
As of December 31, 2020, Georgia Power had contracts in effect to purchase generation from 36 small IPPs. During 2020, Georgia
Power purchased 4.5 billion KWHs from such companies at a cost of $253 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity
with five cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2020,
Georgia Power purchased 416 million KWHs at a cost of $34 million from these facilities.
As of December 31, 2020, Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the
terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2020, Mississippi Power did not make any such
purchases.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive
franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil
and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are
considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance.
Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation
phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen
energy source for the life of the equipment.
I-8
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:
•changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;
•general economic conditions;
•energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;
•legislation and regulations;
•the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and
•technological changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.
The natural gas-related programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of
natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to
market the benefits of natural gas appliances.
The availability and affordability of natural gas have provided cost advantages and further opportunity for growth of the businesses.
Seasonality and Demand
The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. While the electric power
sales of some electric utilities peak in the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, during normal weather conditions,
the Southern Company system's electric power sales peak during both the summer and winter. In most of the areas Southern
Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of the Registrants in the
future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and
natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "General" and – RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS – "Southern Company Gas – Seasonality of Results" in Item 7 herein for information regarding trends in market
demand for electricity and natural gas and the impact of seasonality on Southern Company Gas' business, respectively.
Regulation
States
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their
respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and
regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except
for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See
"Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.
Federal Power Act
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are
all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and
accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at
cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized
to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of
transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power
Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2020, among the hydroelectric
projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity
of 1.7 million KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially owned by Georgia
Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1.1 million KWs.
In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the
Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting
rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. In 2016, the FERC issued
an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance
also filed multiple appeals of the FERC's 2013 order for the new 30-year license and, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit vacated the order and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. Alabama Power continues to operate the
Coosa River developments under annual licenses issued by the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at
this time.
I-9
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
In 2020, Alabama Power continued the process of developing an application to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa
River, which is expected to be filed with the FERC by November 30, 2021. The current Harris Dam project license will expire on
November 30, 2023.
In 2020, the FERC issued a new 40-year license to Georgia Power for the Wallace Dam project on the Oconee River. In 2018,
Georgia Power filed a Notice of Intent to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project on the Ocmulgee River. The application to relicense the
Lloyd Shoals project is expected to be filed with the FERC by December 31, 2021. The current Lloyd Shoals project license will
expire on December 31, 2023. Also in 2018, Georgia Power filed applications to surrender the Langdale and Riverview
hydroelectric projects on the Chattahoochee River upon their license expirations on December 31, 2023. Both projects together
represent 1,520 KWs of Georgia Power's hydro fleet capacity.
Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2026, for the Rocky Mountain project, a pure pumped storage facility of
903,000 KW installed capacity. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2034-2066 in the case of Alabama Power's projects
and in the years 2035-2044 in the case of Georgia Power's projects.
Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may
relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the
original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the
net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other
property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain
requirements that could result in additional costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Regulation
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing
and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as
mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended,
and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment,
protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity
with antitrust laws.
The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. The NRC licenses for
Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and
2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively.
In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs
allowed full construction to begin. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8
herein for additional information.
See Notes 3 and 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Insurance" and "Nuclear Decommissioning," respectively, in Item 8
herein for additional information.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
See "Construction Programs" herein, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
– "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein, and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" and Note 6
to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information concerning environmental laws and regulations impacting the
Registrants.
Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans
Electric
The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout
their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used
and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are
presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill
charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with
I-10
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their
respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are
subject to final state PSC approval.
The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate
mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost
recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the
respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi
Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are
recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery
mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at
Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings.
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also
see "Integrated Resource Planning" herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized
by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval
must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC.
The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2020 and are
generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any
changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory
agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction.
These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs,
including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer
consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution
utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption
changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural
gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set
by the Georgia PSC.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility,
allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation,
energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain
cost recovery mechanisms.
Integrated Resource Planning
Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it
maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7
herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of
the traditional electric operating companies.
Alabama Power
Triennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning
process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-
side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric
service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet expected
customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs
any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing
I-11
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
system in the usual course of business. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of
Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Georgia Power
Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service
needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must
certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of
actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from
recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. See Note
2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans." Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under and "Georgia
Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information on the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the
Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which allow Georgia Power to recover certain financing costs for
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Mississippi Power
In November 2019, the Mississippi PSC established the Integrated Resource Planning and Reporting Rule (IRP Rule), which is
intended to allow electric utilities the flexibility to formulate long-term plans to best meet the needs of their customers through a
combination of demand-side and supply-side resources and considering transmission needs. The IRP Rule establishes reporting
requirements that include the triennial filing of an IRP, with supply-side updates midway through the three-year cycle, and an
annual report on energy delivery improvements. The IRP filing is not intended to supplant or replace the Mississippi PSC's existing
regulatory processes for petition and approval of CPCNs for new generating resources. Mississippi Power will file its first triennial
IRP in compliance with the IRP Rule in April 2021.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Reserve Margin Plan" in Item 8 herein for information regarding
an order issued by the Mississippi PSC on December 17, 2020 requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a
schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce Mississippi Power's
excess reserve margin.
Human Capital
Southern Company system management is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a sustainable workforce and aims to
foster a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and innovative culture. The Southern Company system's values – safety first, unquestionable
trust, superior performance, and total commitment – guide behavior. The Southern Company system had approximately 27,700
employees on its payroll at December 31, 2020 comprised of the following:
At December 31, 2020
Alabama Power 6,200
Georgia Power 6,700
Mississippi Power 1,000
Southern Power 400
Southern Company Gas 4,500
SCS 3,800
Southern Nuclear 4,000
PowerSecure and other 1,100
Total Southern Company system 27,700
(*)Numbers are rounded to 100s.
All Southern Company system employees are located within the United States. Part-time employees represent less than 1% of total
employees.
Southern Company system management values a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce. Southern Company's subsidiaries
have policies, programs, and processes to help ensure that all groups are represented, included, and fairly treated across all job
levels. The Southern Company Board of Directors and management believe that diversity is important to provide different
perspectives on risk, business strategy, and innovation. Southern Company management leads the Southern Company system's
diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and employee recruitment, retention, and development efforts. The Board, principally
through its Compensation and Management Succession Committee, oversees these efforts. At December 31, 2020, people of color
and women represented 28% and 25%, respectively, of the Southern Company system's workforce.(*)
I-12
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Southern Company system management recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining an appropriately qualified workforce.
Southern Company system management uses a variety of strategies to attract and retain talent, including working with high schools,
technical schools, universities, and military installations to fill many entry-level positions. The recruiting strategy also includes
partnerships with professional associations and local communities to recruit mid-career talent. The addition of external hires
augments the existing workforce to meet changing business needs, address any critical skill gaps, and supplement and diversify the
Southern Company system's talent pipeline.
The Southern Company system supports the well-being of its employees through a total rewards strategy with three measurable
categories: physical, financial, and emotional well-being. The Southern Company system provides competitive salaries, annual
incentive awards for nearly all employees, and health, welfare, and retirement benefits. The Southern Company system has a
qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan and a qualified defined contribution, trusteed 401(k) plan which provides a
competitive company matching contribution. Substantially all Southern Company system employees are eligible to participate in
these plans. There are differences between the pension plan benefit formulas based on when and by which subsidiary an employee
is hired. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. At December 31, 2020, the average age of the Southern
Company system employees was 45 and the average tenure with the Southern Company system was 15 years. Turnover rate,
calculated as the percent of employees that terminated employment with the Southern Company system, including voluntary and
involuntary terminations and retirements, divided by total employees, was 5.7%.
Southern Company system management is committed to developing talent and helping employees succeed by providing
development opportunities along with purposeful people moves as part of individual development plans and succession planning
processes. The Southern Company system has multiple development programs, including programs targeted toward all employees,
high potential employees, first-level managers, managers of managers, and executives. Additionally, Southern Company system
management strives to deliver consistent needs-based training and solutions as workplace needs evolve.
Southern Company system management believes the safety of employees and customers is paramount. The Southern Company
system seeks to meet or exceed applicable laws and regulations while continually improving its safety technologies and processes.
The Southern Company System Safety and Health Council, which includes leaders from each Registrant, works collectively across
the Southern Company system to provide safety leadership, share learning, work collaboratively to address safety-related issues,
and govern the consistency of safety programs. The safety programs are focused on the prevention and elimination of life-altering
events, serious injuries, and fatalities. These programs include continuous process improvements to put critical controls in place to
prevent serious injuries, promote learning, and implement appropriate corrective actions. In 2020, the Southern Company system
had a serious injury rate of 0.10, which represent the number of incidents per 100 employees (calculated by taking the number of
serious injuries multiplied by 200,000 workhours and divided by the total employee workhours during the year). A serious injury is
one that is life-threatening or life-changing for the employee. Serious injury examples, as defined by applicable safety regulators,
include fatalities, amputations, trauma to organs, certain bone fractures, severe burns, and eye injuries.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the Southern Company system has continued to provide essential
services to customers while protecting employees, customers, and communities by implementing applicable business continuity
plans, including teleworking, canceling nonessential business travel, increasing cleaning frequency at business locations,
implementing applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal, state, and local officials, and establishing protocols for
required work on customer premises. To date, these procedures have been effective in maintaining the Southern Company system's
critical operations, while also emphasizing employee, customer, and community safety.
The Southern Company system also has longstanding relationships with labor unions. The traditional electric operating companies,
Southern Nuclear, and the natural gas distribution utilities have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW, which
generally apply to operating, maintenance, and construction employees. These agreements cover wages, benefits, terms of the
pension plans, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and arbitration. The Southern Company system also
partners with the IBEW to provide training programs to develop technical skills and career opportunities.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 32% of Southern Company system employees were covered by agreements with unions,
with agreements expiring between 2021 and 2025. Negotiations related to the agreement expiring in 2021 are expected to
commence later in the first quarter 2021.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS –
FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7, and other documents filed by Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries
with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and
its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries. The risk factors discussed
below could adversely affect a Registrant's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow.
UTILITY REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LITIGATION RISKS
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial federal, state, and local governmental regulation,
including with respect to rates. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary
approvals, permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
Laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services the Southern Company system offers, protection of critical
electric infrastructure assets, transmission planning, reliability, pipeline safety, interaction with wholesale markets, and
relationships with affiliates, among other matters. The Registrants' businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result
in substantial monetary penalties if a Registrant is found to be noncompliant.
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities seek to recover their costs, including
compliance costs (including a reasonable return on invested capital), through their retail rates, which must be approved by the
applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. Such regulators, in a future rate proceeding, may alter the timing
or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate refunds may also be
required. Additionally, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional electric operating companies and by Southern
Power and the rates charged to natural gas transportation customers by Southern Company Gas' pipeline investments and for some
of its storage assets must be approved by the FERC. Changes to Southern Power's and the traditional electric operating companies'
ability to conduct business pursuant to FERC market-based rate authority could affect these entities' wholesale rates. Also, a small
percentage of transmission revenues are collected through wholesale electric tariffs but the majority are collected through retail
rates, and transmission planning could be impacted by FERC policy changes.
The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations
applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries is uncertain. Changes in regulation, the imposition of additional
regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for noncompliance with existing laws or
regulations could influence the operating environment of Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial
costs.
The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws and satisfying related AROs are significant.
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and
regulations governing air, GHGs, water, land, and other natural resources. Compliance with existing environmental requirements
involves significant capital and operating costs including the settlement of AROs, a major portion of which is expected to be
recovered through retail and wholesale rates. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered. The Registrants
expect future compliance expenditures will continue to be significant.
The EPA has adopted and is implementing regulations governing air and GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act and water quality
under the Clean Water Act. The EPA and certain states have also adopted and continue to propose regulations governing the
disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments at active generating power plants. The cost
estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-
closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential compliance methods. The traditional
electric operating companies will continue to periodically update their ARO cost estimates.
Additionally, environmental laws and regulations covering the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances
could require the Southern Company system to incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites, including certain current and
former operating sites, and locations subject to contractual obligations.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, and citizen
enforcement of environmental requirements has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included, but is not limited to,
claims for damages alleged to have been caused by COand other emissions, CCR, releases of regulated substances, and alleged
exposure to regulated substances, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.
Compliance with any new or revised environmental laws or regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Southern
Company system. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy and future environmental2 
I-14
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of
any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may
result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements,
operational changes, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company
system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. Environmental compliance spending over the next several
years may differ materially from the amounts estimated and could adversely affect the Registrants if such costs cannot continue to
be recovered on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced
demand for electricity and natural gas. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing
and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas.
The Southern Company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of GHG legislation,
regulation, and emission reduction goals.
Costs associated with GHG legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant. Additional GHG policies,
including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG emitting economy.
However, the ultimate impact will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, low
natural gas prices, the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies, the ability to recover costs
through existing ratemaking provisions, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.
Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuels, future GHG constraints, including, but
not limited to, the imposition of a carbon tax, may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and
direct use in homes and businesses. However, such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain
situations, such as new construction. Future GHG constraints designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise
result in increased costs to the Southern Company system and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to
customers and the competitive position of natural gas.
Southern Company has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a
long-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas
prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-carbon energy technologies and negative carbon
concepts. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and
carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continuing research and development with a particular focus on technologies
that lower GHG emissions including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with
policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters –
Global Climate Issues" in Item 7 herein for additional information.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are
unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.
The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of the electric generation,
transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution and storage facilities, and distributed generation storage
technologies and the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. There are many risks that could affect these
operations and performance of corporate functions, including operator error or failure of equipment or processes, accidents,
operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements or in connection with joint owner
arrangements, labor disputes, physical attacks, fuel or material supply interruptions and/or shortages, transmission disruption or
capacity constraints, including with respect to the Southern Company system's and third parties' transmission, storage, and
transportation facilities, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards,
implementation of new technologies, technology system failures, cyber intrusions, environmental events, such as spills or releases,
and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic
health events, political unrest, or other similar occurrences.
Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, safety, health, regulatory, natural disasters,
cyber intrusions or physical attacks, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of the nuclear units owned
by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential exposures in excess of insurance coverage.
Alabama Power owns, and contracts for the operation of, two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and
contracts for the operation of, four existing nuclear units. The six existing units are operated by Southern Nuclear and
I-15
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
represented approximately 27% of the total KWHs generated by each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power in the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners, is managing the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, safety, health, operational, and financial
risks such as: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and safety resulting from a release of radioactive
materials; uncertainties with respect to the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and the need for longer term on-site storage;
uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of licensed lives
and the ability to maintain and anticipate adequate capital reserves for decommissioning; limitations on the amounts and types of
insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with any nuclear operations; and significant capital
expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, and repair of these facilities.
Damages, decommissioning, or other costs could exceed the amount of decommissioning trusts or external insurance coverage,
including statutorily required nuclear incident insurance.
The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear
facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down any unit, depending upon its
assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security
measures and any future NRC safety requirements could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make substantial operating
and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could result in substantial
costs to Alabama Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world
could cause the NRC to delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear units or require additional safety measures at new and
existing units. Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S., including facilities owned and operated by third
parties, could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to make material contributory payments.
In addition, actual or potential threats of cyber intrusions or physical attacks could result in increased nuclear licensing or
compliance costs that are difficult to predict.
Transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks,
such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury, loss of life, significant damage
to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near
populated areas could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. Additionally, these pipeline and storage facilities are
subject to various state and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in substantial
monetary penalties or potential early retirement of storage facilities, which could trigger an associated impairment.
Physical attacks, both threatened and actual, could impact the ability of the Subsidiary Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants face the risk of physical attacks, both threatened and actual, against their respective generation and
storage facilities and the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport energy, which could negatively impact their
ability to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate their respective facilities, or, with respect to Southern
Company Gas, its ability to distribute or store natural gas, or otherwise operate its facilities, in the most efficient manner or at all.
In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect on the Southern Company system.
Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized
access due to human error, natural disasters, technological failure, or internal or external physical attacks. If assets were to fail, be
physically damaged, or be breached and were not restored in a timely manner, the affected Subsidiary Registrant may be unable to
fulfill critical business functions, which would cause reputational damage. Insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated
losses.
An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of, or inability to remotely access, one or
more key technology systems, networks, or processes could impact the ability of the Registrants to operate.
The Subsidiary Registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology
systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected systems. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure
and the technology systems' inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, denial of service, ransomware,
acts of war or terrorism, or other types of data security breaches, the Southern Company system faces a heightened risk of
cyberattack. There have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by cyber actors, including those associated with
foreign governments. The Registrants and their third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to
attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related
business operations. While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial
fraud, and disruption of remote access across the Southern Company system, there has
I-16
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks. However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security
efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure
and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Southern Company and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information,
including personally identifiable information about customers, employees, and stockholders, and other confidential information. In
some cases, administration of certain functions may be outsourced to third-party service providers that could also be targets of
cyber attacks.
Internal or external cyber attacks may inhibit the affected Registrant's ability to fulfill critical business functions, compromise
sensitive and other data, and cause reputational damage. Any cyber breach or theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive
electronic data may also subject the affected Registrant to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. Insurance may
not be adequate to cover any associated losses.
The Southern Company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas, fuel supplies, and other resources required
to operate the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's electric generating plants or serve Southern
Company Gas' natural gas customers.
SCS, on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, purchases fuel for the Southern Company
system's generation fleet from a diverse set of suppliers. Southern Company Gas' primary business is the distribution of natural gas
through the natural gas distribution utilities. Natural gas is delivered daily from different regions of the country. This daily supply is
complemented by natural gas supplies stored in third party storage locations. To deliver this daily supply and storage, the Southern
Company system has firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate pipelines. Disruption in the supply and/or
delivery of fuel as a result of matters such as transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events, or environmental
regulations affecting fuel suppliers could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to
operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs, and the ability of Southern Company Gas to serve its
natural gas customers.
The Southern Company system has become more dependent upon natural gas as a fuel source for its power generation needs, which
not only has the potential to impact the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's costs of generation but the
costs of purchased power as well. The robust growth in supply over the last several years has allowed natural gas prices, for the
most part, to remain below $3 per mmBtu; however, prices continue to be very volatile. With the majority of natural gas production
being from shale gas formations, any limitation on shale gas production would be expected to have a material impact on the supply
availability as well as the cost of natural gas. In addition, new demand, in particular exports to Mexico and those from LNG
facilities, has grown significantly and is having greater impact on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern
Power's natural gas markets.
The traditional electric operating companies are also dependent on coal, and related coal supply contracts, for a portion of their
electric generating capacity. The counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of
financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers may be delayed in supplying or may not be required to supply coal under
certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain
their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, and these increased
costs may not be recoverable through rates.
In addition to fuel supply, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power also need adequate access to water,
which is drawn from nearby sources, to aid in the production of electricity returned to its source after use. Any impact to their water
resources could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities,
which could result in higher fuel and operating costs.
The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on
sales under PPAs, the success of which depend on PPA counterparties performing their obligations, Southern Company
subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the PPAs, and renewal or replacement of the PPAs for the related
generating capacity.
Most of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. Southern Power's top three customers,
Southern California Edison, Georgia Power, and Duke Energy Corporation accounted for 9.4%, 8.0%, and 6.7%, respectively, of
Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The traditional electric operating companies have entered
into PPAs with non-affiliated parties.
The revenues related to PPAs are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations. Although the
credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating
companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater
than predicted or specified in the applicable contract.
I-17
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed
at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. The failure of a Southern Company subsidiary to
satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs, including PPAs related to fuel cell technology and/or
renewable projects, including projects under construction, could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.
The asset management arrangements between Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services and its customers, including
the natural gas distribution utilities, may not be renewed or may be renewed at lower levels.
Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services currently manages the storage and transportation assets of the natural gas
distribution utilities (except Nicor Gas) as well as certain non-affiliated customers. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services
has a concentration of credit risk in 20 of its counterparties for services it provides.
The profits earned from the management of affiliate assets are shared with the respective affiliate's customers (and for Atlanta Gas
Light with the Georgia PSC's Universal Service Fund), except for Chattanooga Gas where wholesale gas services are provided
under annual fixed-fee agreements. These asset management agreements are subject to regulatory approval.
These asset management agreements may not be renewed at the end of their respective terms or may be renewed with less
favorable terms. Additionally, sustained low natural gas prices could reduce the demand for these types of asset management
arrangements.
Increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in
customer demand for energy could negatively impact Southern Company and its subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers
those investments and earns a return for investors through state regulation. Southern Power's business model is primarily focused
on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy counterparties using a bilateral contract model. A key premise
of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive
cost.
New technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer demand for sustainable assets could
change the type of assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery. Advances in these technologies or changes in laws or
regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technologies or other alternative methods of producing power to
a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more
cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self-generation by customers. Broader use of distributed generation
by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation
technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature may modify certain aspects of the
traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology.
It is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating
facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the
channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power.
Southern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing
similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. Southern Company
Gas' wholesale gas services competes for sales with national and regional full-service energy providers, energy merchants and
producers, and pipelines based on the ability to aggregate competitively-priced commodities with transportation and storage
capacity. Southern Company Gas competes with natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., where the majority of the
existing and proposed high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in North America are located.
If new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be
eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution and storage facilities could be
reduced. Additionally, these technology and customer-induced changes to the electric generation business models could change the
risk profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could be
reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets.
The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.
The Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging
workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead
to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development,
including workforce needs associated with major construction projects and ongoing operations. The Southern
I-18
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure
to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and
expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its
subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses.
The Registrants are subject to risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, disruption to the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for Southern Company and Georgia Power.
COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and has spread globally, including throughout the United States. In response, most jurisdictions, including in the United States,
initially instituted restrictions on travel, public gatherings, and non-essential business operations. While some jurisdictions,
including some in the Southern Company system's service territory, have relaxed some of these restrictions, many of these
restrictions remain and there is no guarantee restrictions will not be reimposed in the future. These restrictions have significantly
disrupted economic activity in the service territories of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution
utilities and caused volatility in capital markets at certain periods during 2020. For example, retail electric revenues have declined
slightly compared to 2019, as discussed further in RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – "Southern Company – Electricity Business" in
Item 7 herein. In addition, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities temporarily
suspended disconnections for non-payment by customers and waived late fees for certain periods. The effects of the continued
COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and
capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects
could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited to, continued reduced demand for energy,
particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments
recorded at fair value, and further impairment of the ability of the Registrants to develop, construct, and operate facilities, including
electric generation, transmission, and distribution assets, to perform necessary corporate and customer service functions, and to
access funds from financial institutions and capital markets. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could cause delays or
cancellations of regulatory proceedings.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities
at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in
Item 8 herein.
CONSTRUCTION RISKS
The Registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities
and may not be able to recover their investments. Also, existing facilities of the Subsidiary Registrants require ongoing
expenditures, including those to meet AROs and other environmental standards and goals.
General
The businesses of the Registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements,
including transmission, distribution, and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies, generation facilities
for Southern Power, and capital improvements to natural gas distribution and storage facilities for Southern Company Gas. These
expenditures also include those to settle AROs and meet environmental standards and goals. The traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding environmental modifications
to certain existing generating facilities. The traditional electric operating companies also are in the process of closing ash ponds to
comply with the CCR Rule and, where applicable, state CCR rules. Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipelines in its
natural gas distribution system and is involved in certain gas pipeline construction projects. The Southern Company system intends
to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric
transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and
regulations. These projects are long term in nature and in some cases may include the development and construction of facilities
with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed.
The completion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have
occurred or may occur, including labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with managing contractors and/or vendors;
subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; contractor and/or vendor delays, increased costs,
shortages, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance
under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site
safety programs; engineering or design problems; design and other licensing-based compliance matters; additional negative impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemic health events; work stoppages; challenges with start-up activities (including major
equipment failure or system integration) and/or operational performance; continued public and policymaker support for projects;
environmental and geological conditions; delays or increased costs to interconnect
I-19
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
facilities to transmission grids; and increased financing costs as a result of changes in market interest rates or as a result of project
delays.
If a Subsidiary Registrant is unable to complete the development or construction of a project or decides to delay or cancel
construction of a project, it may not be able to recover its investment in that project and may incur substantial cancellation
payments under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts, as well as other costs associated with the closure and/or
abandonment of the construction project.
In addition, partnership and joint ownership agreements may provide partners or co-owners with certain decision-making authority
in connection with projects under construction, including rights to cause the cancellation of a construction project under certain
circumstances. Any failure by a partner or co-owner to perform its obligations under the applicable agreements could have a
material negative impact on the applicable project under construction. Southern Company Gas is a minority investor in the joint
venture constructing the PennEast Pipeline project, Southern Power participates in partnership agreements with respect to a
majority of its renewable energy projects, and Georgia Power jointly owns Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with other co-owners. See
Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding other
jointly-owned facilities.
If construction projects are not completed according to specification, a Registrant may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant
efficiency, higher operating costs, and reduced net income. Furthermore, construction delays associated with renewable projects
could result in the loss of otherwise available tax credits and incentives.
Even if a construction project (including a joint venture construction project) is completed, the total costs may be higher than
estimated and may not be recoverable through regulated rates, if applicable. In addition, construction delays and contractor
performance shortfalls can result in the loss of revenues. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern
Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Southern Company and Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of
$1.4 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) through December 31, 2020 to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete construction
and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in
Item 8 herein for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also see Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other
Matters – Southern Company Gas – PennEast Pipeline Project" in Item 8 herein for information regarding the PennEast Pipeline
project and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity" in
Item 8 herein for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.
Once facilities become operational, ongoing capital expenditures are required to maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant
portions of the traditional electric operating companies' existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older equipment, even
if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply
with changing environmental requirements, to provide safe and reliable operations, and/or to meet related retirement obligations.
Southern Company Gas' significant investments in pipelines and the PennEast Pipeline project involve financial and
execution risks.
Southern Company Gas has made significant investments in existing pipelines and the PennEast Pipeline project. Many of the
existing pipelines are, and, when completed, the PennEast Pipeline project will be, operated by third parties. If one of these agents
fails to perform in a proper manner, the value of the investment could decline and Southern Company Gas could lose part or all of
its investment. In addition, Southern Company Gas is required to fulfill capital obligations to pipeline joint ventures.
With respect to the PennEast Pipeline project, Southern Company Gas will rely on its joint venture partners for construction
management and will not exercise direct control over the process. The PennEast Pipeline project is dependent on contractors for the
successful and timely completion of the project. Further, the development of the PennEast Pipeline involves numerous regulatory,
environmental, construction, safety, political, and legal uncertainties and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of
capital. This project may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. There may be cost overruns and construction
difficulties that cause Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures to exceed its initial expectations. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under "Other Matters – Southern Company Gas – PennEast Pipeline Project" in Item 8 herein for information regarding
this project.
FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS
The electric generation and energy marketing operations of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
Power and the natural gas operations of Southern Company Gas are subject to changes in energy prices and fuel costs.
The generation, energy marketing, and natural gas operations of the Southern Company system are subject to changes in energy
prices and fuel costs, which could increase the cost of producing power, decrease the amount received from the sale of energy,
and/or make electric generating facilities less competitive. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly
I-20
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which could increase the expenses and/or
reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas
distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to
experience underrecovered fuel and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery
may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including
increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by the customers of the Subsidiary Registrants.
The consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the
economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per
customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could
negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.
Outside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions
and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the
consumption of energy. For example, some cities in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction.
Both federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Company Gas have PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy
efficiency.
Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases
in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.
In addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies
utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as electric and natural gas vehicles can
create additional demand. The Southern Company system uses best available methods and experience to incorporate the effects of
changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and
technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.
The operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In
addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary
Registrant.
Electric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less
power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
Volatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional
electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, and the
natural gas distribution and storage facilities of Southern Company Gas. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in
the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states which
could be subject to severe weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. Further, severe drought conditions can
reduce the availability of water and restrict or prevent the operation of certain generating facilities.
In the event a traditional electric operating company or Southern Company Gas experiences any of these weather events or any
natural disaster or other catastrophic event, recovery of costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval
of its state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The traditional electric operating companies from time to time have
experienced and may continue to experience deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances. Additionally, the applicable state
PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency may deny or delay recovery of any portion of such costs.
In addition, damages resulting from significant weather events occurring within a Subsidiary Registrant's service territory or
otherwise affecting its customers may result in the loss of customers and reduced demand for energy for extended periods and may
impact customers' ability to perform under existing PPAs.
I-21
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Acquisitions, dispositions, or other strategic ventures or investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present
risks not originally contemplated.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries have made significant acquisitions, dispositions, and investments in the past, and may
continue to do so. Such actions cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern Company or its subsidiaries. Southern
Company and its subsidiaries continually seek opportunities to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions or
sales of assets. Specifically, Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various
transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new
generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving
entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries may face significant competition for transactional opportunities and anticipated transactions
may not be completed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, these transactions are intended to, but may not, result in the
generation of cash or income, the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, or the reduction of risk.
These transactions also involve risks, including that they may not result in an increase in income or provide adequate or expected
funds or return on capital or other anticipated benefits; they may result in Southern Company or its subsidiaries entering into new
or additional lines of business, which may have new or different business or operational risks; they may not be successfully
integrated into the acquiring company's operations, internal control processes and/or accounting systems; the due diligence
conducted prior to a transaction may not uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure or may not appropriately
evaluate the likelihood or quantify the exposure from identified risks; they may result in decreased earnings, revenues, or cash
flow; they may involve retained obligations in connection with transitional agreements or deferred payments related to dispositions
that subject Southern Company or its subsidiaries to additional risk; Southern Company or the applicable subsidiary may not be
able to achieve the expected financial benefits from the use of funds generated by any dispositions; expected benefits of a
transaction may be dependent on the cooperation, performance, or credit risk of a counterparty; minority investments in growth
companies may not result in a positive return on investment; or, for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern
Company Gas, costs associated with such investments that were expected to be recovered through regulated rates may not be
recoverable.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and Southern Power owns many of its assets
indirectly through subsidiaries. Each of these companies is dependent on cash flows from their respective subsidiaries to
meet their ongoing and future financial obligations.
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies and, as such, they have no operations of their own.
Substantially all of Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' and many of Southern Power's respective consolidated assets
are held by subsidiaries. Southern Company's, Southern Company Gas' and, to a certain extent, Southern Power's ability to meet
their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and, for
Southern Company, to pay dividends on its common stock, is dependent on the net income and cash flows of their respective
subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Southern
Company, Southern Company Gas, or Southern Power, the respective subsidiaries have financial obligations and, with respect to
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, regulatory restrictions that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service
and preferred stock dividends. In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital
contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their
respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay
dividends on Southern Company's common stock.
A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively
affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain
indebtedness.
There are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas
Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other
commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital,
and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial
risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a
negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or
Nicor Gas borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates under applicable term
loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to
below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating
downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used, and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness
and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.

Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.
Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process
to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas
engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines and storage facilities,
replacing existing pipelines, rewatering storage facilities, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These
planning processes must project many years into the future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the
permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution and storage
facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic
conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, customer technology adoption, and the duration and extent of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or Southern Company Gas'
regulated operating companies to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new
pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or
may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers' rates.
In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs,
Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power
and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, or they may
be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended.
The traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers
under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At
peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available
generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity
on the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity
on the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or
construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these
costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed
capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed
price PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs.
The businesses of the Registrants and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital through capital
markets and financial institutions.
The Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant
source of liquidity to meet capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the
Registrants or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business
plan will be limited due to weakened capacity to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve
future earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on committed credit facilities as back-up liquidity
for access to low cost money markets. Certain market disruptions, including an economic downturn or uncertainty, bankruptcy or
financial distress at an unrelated utility company, financial institution, or sovereign entity, capital markets volatility and disruption,
either nationally or internationally, changes in tax policy, volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas, actual or
threatened cyber or physical attacks on facilities within the Southern Company system or owned by unrelated utility companies,
future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemic health events, war or threat of war, or the overall health of the utility
and financial institution industries, may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the
issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up
sources of capital.
Additionally, due to a portion of the Registrants' indebtedness bearing interest at variable rates based on LIBOR or other floating
benchmark rates, the potential phasing out of these rates may adversely affect the costs of financing. The discontinuation, reform,
or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual relationships in the credit
markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets and could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of, and
market for the Registrants' securities and other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark.
Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern
Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings.
The debt and credit agreements of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various
financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of
default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those
covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning.
The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of
return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan,
changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern
Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences
between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and
other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement
expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts
of cash. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial
statements in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy
obligations to decommission their nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the
funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
"Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.
The financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, and natural disasters, among
other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance may decrease, and the insurance that
the Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the
insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.
The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in
financial losses that negatively impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their
commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in
limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these
contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures,
which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative
contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in
financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of
these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these
instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in
the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.
In addition, Southern Company Gas utilizes derivative instruments to lock in economic value in wholesale gas services, which may
not qualify as, or may not be designated as, hedges for accounting purposes. The difference in accounting treatment for the
underlying position and the financial instrument used to hedge the value of the contract can cause volatility in reported net income
of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas while the positions are open due to mark-to-market accounting.
See Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Future impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' results of
operations.
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value and long-lived assets are assessed for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2020,
goodwill was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, respectively.
In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries have long-lived assets recorded on their balance sheets. To the extent the value
of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, the affected Registrant may be required to incur impairment charges that could
have a material impact on their results of operations. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters" in Item 8 herein
for information regarding certain impairment charges at Southern Company and Southern Company Gas.

Mississippi Power owns a lignite mine and equipment that were intended to provide fuel for the Kemper IGCC. Mississippi Power
also has mineral reserves located around the Kemper County energy facility. Liberty Fuels Company, LLC, the operator of the
mine, has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation
activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially
completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2027. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other
Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
On December 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a
schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce Mississippi Power's
excess reserve margin. Mississippi Power's IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2021. See BUSINESS in Item 1 herein under "Rate
Matters – Integrated Resource Planning – Mississippi Power" and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power –
Reserve Margin Plan" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power agreed to seek a restructuring of
their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such that each of them would, after the restructuring, own 100% of a
generating unit. In January 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the
generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership
interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that
date. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Plant Daniel" in Item 8 herein for
additional information.
In 2020, the maximum demand on the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO was
32,765,000 KWs and occurred on July 20, 2020. The all-time maximum demand of 38,777,000 KWs on the traditional electric
operating companies (including Gulf Power), Southern Power Company, and SEGCO occurred on August 22, 2007. These amounts
exclude demand served by capacity retained by MEAG Power, OPC, and SEPA. The reserve margin for the traditional electric
operating companies, Southern Power Company, and SEGCO in 2020 was 32.6%.

4, (2) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the
Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as
liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements, and (3) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement
obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) Georgia Power's 45.7% undivided
ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts
relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under "Assets Subject to Lien" and Note 8 to the
financial statements under "Long-term Debt" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating
companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See "Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein and
Note 5 to the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such
as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way,
which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held
under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not
owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental
entities.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable
for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties
that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties are subject to the lien of the
indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Distribution and Transmission Mains
Southern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas.
These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service
lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2020, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned
approximately 75,924 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way
that generally provide for perpetual use.
Storage Assets
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of
approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet
about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of
storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flexibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk
associated with seasonal price movements.
Southern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of
approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage
capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facility are used by Southern Company Gas' gas
distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.
All Other
Southern Company Gas subsidiaries own two high-deliverability natural gas storage and hub facilities that are included in the all
other segment. Golden Triangle Storage, Inc. operates a storage facility in Texas consisting of two salt dome caverns. Central
Valley Gas Storage, LLC operates a depleted field storage facility in California. See Note 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for information regarding the sale of Jefferson Island.
Jointly-Owned Properties
Southern Company Gas' gas pipeline investments segment has a 50% undivided ownership interest in a 115-mile pipeline facility in
northwest Georgia that was placed in service in 2017. Southern Company Gas also has an agreement to lease its 50%

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
OVERVIEW
Business Activities
Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, as
well as Southern Power and Southern Company Gas, and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the
Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the
distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the
traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale
of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements
for additional information.
•The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically
integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale
customers in the Southeast.
•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy
and battery energy storage projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power
continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions,
dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into
PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as
well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of
new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.
•Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas.
Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee –
and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through
four reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, which includes
Sequent, a natural gas asset optimization company, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and
provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-reportable segment, all other. See
Notes 7 and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.
Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's electric service and natural gas
businesses. These factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow sales and
customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs. These costs include those related to
projected long-term demand growth; stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules; safety; system reliability and
resilience; fuel; natural gas; restoration following major storms; and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric
generating plants and expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems.
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that
address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs
and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Southern Company system for the foreseeable future.
See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Power's future earnings will depend upon the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its
wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct
generating facilities. In addition, Southern Power's future earnings will depend upon the availability of federal and state ITCs and
PTCs on its renewable energy projects, which could be impacted by future tax legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
– "Income Tax Matters" herein and Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Company's other business activities include providing energy solutions to electric utilities and their customers in the areas
of distributed generation, energy storage and renewables, and energy efficiency. Other business activities also include investments
in telecommunications, leveraged lease projects, and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of
each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or
investments accordingly.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Recent Developments
COVID-19
During March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and has spread globally, including throughout the United States. The Southern Company system provides an
essential service to its customers; therefore, it is critical that Southern Company system employees are able to continue to perform
their essential duties safely and effectively. The Southern Company system has implemented applicable business continuity plans,
including teleworking, canceling non-essential business travel, increasing cleaning frequency at business locations, implementing
applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal and state officials, and establishing protocols for required work on
customer premises. To date, these procedures have been effective in maintaining the Southern Company system's critical
operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been economic disruptions in the Registrants' operating territories.
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities temporarily suspended disconnections for non-
payment by customers and waived late fees for certain periods. See Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding
deferral of certain incremental COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt, to a regulatory asset by certain of the traditional
electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted
productivity and the pace of activity completion at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed further herein. Additional information
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its past and potential future impacts on the Registrants is provided throughout
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 1A herein.
Alabama Power
On August 14, 2020, the Alabama PSC issued an order granting Alabama Power a CCN to procure additional capacity, and, on
August 31, 2020, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station.
In October 2020, Alabama Power reduced its over-collected fuel balance by $94.3 million in accordance with an August 7, 2020
Alabama PSC order authorizing Alabama Power to reduce its over-collected fuel balance by $100 million and return that amount to
customers in the form of bill credits, with any undistributed amount remaining in the regulatory liability for the benefit of
customers.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama
Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $50 million for Rate RSE refunds, which will be refunded to customers through
bill credits in April 2021.
During 2020, Alabama Power recorded $51 million and $67 million against the NDR for damages incurred to its transmission and
distribution facilities from Hurricane Sally and Hurricane Zeta, respectively. Alabama Power made an additional accrual of
$100 million to the NDR in December 2020.
Effective for the billing month of January 2021, Alabama Power's Rate RSE increased 4.09%, or approximately $228 million
annually, and Alabama Power's Rate ECR decreased 1.84%, or approximately $103 million annually, as approved by the Alabama
PSC.
See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" for additional information.
Georgia Power
Rate Plans
On December 15, 2020, in accordance with the terms of the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective
January 1, 2021 as follows: (i) increased traditional base tariffs by approximately $120 million; (ii) increased the Environmental
Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff by approximately $2 million; (iii) decreased Demand-Side Management tariffs by
approximately $15 million; and (iv) increased Municipal Franchise Fee tariffs by approximately $4 million, for a total net increase
in annual base revenues of approximately $111 million. Georgia Power expects to submit a compliance filing in the third quarter
2021 to request tariff adjustments approved pursuant to the 2019 ARP effective January 1, 2022. The amounts requested in the 2019
ARP were as follows: (i) increase traditional base tariffs by approximately $192 million; (ii) increase the ECCR tariff by
approximately $184 million; (iii) increase Demand-Side Management tariffs by approximately $1 million; and (iv) increase
Municipal Franchise Fee tariffs by approximately $9 million, for a total increase in annual base revenues of approximately $386
million. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP" for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Status
Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in
which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast is $8.7
billion, with expected in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.
As of June 30, 2020, assignments of contingency to the base capital cost forecast exceeded the remaining balance of the
construction contingency originally established in the second quarter 2018 and Georgia Power established $115 million of
additional construction contingency. During the third and fourth quarters 2020, this construction contingency, plus an additional $5
million, was fully assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Assignment of contingency during 2020 addressed cost risks related to
construction productivity, including the April 2020 reduction in workforce designed to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic described below; other COVID-19 impacts; craft labor incentives; additional resources for supervision, field support,
project management, initial test program, start-up, engineering support, and operations and maintenance support; subcontracts; and
procurement, among other factors. These factors continue to represent further potential cost risk to the project; therefore, Georgia
Power established $171 million of additional contingency as of December 31, 2020.
After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate
outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in
future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $149 million ($111 million after tax) and
$176 million ($131 million after tax) for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast as of June 30, 2020 and December
31, 2020, respectively. As and when these amounts are spent, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those
expenditures for rate recovery.
In mid-March 2020, Southern Nuclear began implementing policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of transmission of
COVID-19 at the construction site. In April 2020, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners,
announced a reduction in workforce at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and began reducing the then-existing site workforce by
approximately 20%. This workforce reduction lowered absenteeism, providing an improvement in operational efficiency and
allowing for increased social distancing. Since April 2020, the number of active cases at the site has fluctuated and has continued to
impact productivity levels and pace of activity completion.
From November 2020 through January 2021, the number of active COVID-19 cases at the site increased significantly, consistent
with a national rise in cases, and the project continued to face challenges. As a result, overall production levels were not achieved at
the levels anticipated, contributing to the December 31, 2020 allocation of construction contingency and increase in total project
capital cost forecast. Also, after considering these factors, Southern Nuclear has further extended certain milestone dates, including
the start of hot functional testing and fuel load for Unit 3, from those established in October 2020. These updated milestone dates
are expected to support the regulatory-approved in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4,
respectively. With minimal schedule margin remaining, the Unit 3 schedule is challenged, and any further extension of the hot
functional testing or fuel load milestones, or other delays from the challenges described in Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction," could impact the ability to achieve the November 2021 in-service date.
The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental cost associated with COVID-19 mitigation actions
and impacts on construction productivity is currently estimated to be between $150 million and $190 million and is included in the
total project capital cost. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors on the construction schedule and
budget for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be determined at this time.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Mississippi Power
On March 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff related to Mississippi Power's base rate case filed in November 2019 (Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement
Agreement). Under the terms of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement, annual retail rates decreased
approximately $16.7 million, or 1.85%, effective for the first billing cycle of April 2020.
During 2020, Mississippi Power substantially completed mine reclamation activities at the Kemper County energy facility. On
September 3, 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi
Power's 2018 request for property closeout certification under the contract related to DOE grants received for the Kemper County
energy facility, which enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and

site restoration activities. These activities are expected to be completed by 2026. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility" for additional information.
On February 12, 2021, Mississippi Power submitted its 2021 ECO Plan filing to the Mississippi PSC, which requested an annual
decrease in revenues of approximately $9 million, as well as its ad valorem tax adjustment filing for 2021, which requested an
annual increase in revenues of approximately $28 million. Mississippi Power plans to submit its 2021 PEP filing in March 2021.
On December 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order concluding the RMP docket and requiring Mississippi Power to
incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027
to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin. Mississippi Power's IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2021.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters
cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Power
During 2020, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 200-MW Reading and 136-MW Skookumchuck
wind facilities, commenced construction of the 88-MW Garland and 72-MW Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, and
acquired and commenced construction of the 118-MW Glass Sands wind facility.
In January 2020, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion unit
completed in May 2019) to a subsidiary of Xcel for a purchase price of approximately $663 million, including final working capital
adjustments.
In March 2020, Southern Power entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling membership interest in an approximately 300-
MW wind facility located in South Dakota. The acquisition is subject to certain customary conditions to closing, including
commercial operation of the facility, which is expected to occur in the first quarter 2021. Subsequent to the acquisition, Southern
Power expects to complete a tax equity transaction. The facility's output is contracted under two long-term PPAs. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
In May 2020, Southern Power purchased a controlling interest in the 56-MW Beech Ridge II wind facility located in West Virginia
from Invenergy Renewables LLC. The facility's output is contracted under a 12-year PPA.
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners,
based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or
expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated
with the facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment
coverage ratio at December 31, 2020 was 94% through 2025 and 91% through 2030, with an average remaining contract duration
of approximately 14 years.
See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information.
Southern Company Gas
On March 24, 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline with
aggregate proceeds of $178 million, including final working capital adjustments. On December 1, 2020, Southern Company Gas
completed the sale of Jefferson Island for a purchase price of $33 million, including estimated working capital adjustments. See
Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
On June 1, 2020, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base
revenues of $49.6 million based on a ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54%. Interim rate adjustments became effective
November 1, 2020, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase in the second quarter
2021. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On July 1, 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its 2020 GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of
$37.6 million. Rates became effective on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.
On January 14, 2021, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission, requesting a $293 million increase in
annual base rate revenues, including $94 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program. The
requested increase is based on a projected test year ending December 31, 2022, a ROE of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.5%.
The Illinois Commission has an 11-month statutory time limit to rule on the requested increase, after which rate adjustments will be
effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Key Performance Indicators
In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.6 million electric and
gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on
several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric
and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary
Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – "Southern
Company Gas – Operating Metrics" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating
Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.
The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer
satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices.
The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top
quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" and " – Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan" for additional
information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms
that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.
Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced
outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to
customers.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Southern Company
Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $3.1 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 34.2%, from the
prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the $2.6 billion ($1.4 billion after tax) gain on the sale of Gulf Power in 2019 and
after-tax charges totaling $242 million in 2020 related to Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Notes 2
and 15 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" and "Southern Company," respectively, for
additional information.
Basic EPS was $2.95 in 2020 and $4.53 in 2019. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based
compensation, was $2.93 in 2020 and $4.50 in 2019. EPS for 2020 and 2019 was negatively impacted by $0.03 and $0.11 per
share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under
"Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Southern Company" for additional information.
Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.54 in 2020 and $2.46 in 2019. In January 2021, Southern Company declared a
quarterly dividend of 64 cents per share. For 2020, the dividend payout ratio was 86% compared to 54% for 2019. The increase was
due to the decrease in earnings in 2020.
Discussion of Southern Company's results of operations is divided into three parts – the Southern Company system's primary
business of electricity sales, its gas business, and its other business activities.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Electric Operating Revenues
Electric operating revenues for 2020 were $16.5 billion, reflecting a $598 million decrease from 2019. Details of electric operating
revenues were as follows:
 2020 2019
 (in millions)
Retail electric — prior year $ 14,084 
Estimated change resulting from —
Rates and pricing 484 
Sales decline (132)
Weather (288)
Fuel and other cost recovery (505)
Retail electric — current year $ 13,643 $ 14,084 
Wholesale electric revenues 1,945 2,152 
Other electric revenues 672 636 
Other revenues 237 223 
Electric operating revenues $ 16,497 $ 17,095 
Percent change (3.5)% (7.9)%
Retail electric revenues decreased $441 million, or 3.1%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The significant factors driving this
change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2020 was primarily due to Georgia Power's recovery
of environmental compliance costs and the impacts of accruals for customer refunds in 2019 related to the Tax Reform Legislation
and earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range as well as the rate pricing effects of decreased customer usage throughout
2020. The increase was also due to customer bill credits at Alabama Power in 2019 related to the Tax Reform Legislation. These
increases were partially offset by lower contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven
pricing at Georgia Power.
Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs,
including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses,
including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have
one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new
plants, and PPA capacity costs.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" for additional information. Also see "Energy
Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and
weather.
Wholesale electric revenues consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than
solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to
net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending
on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy
within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs
and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and
customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price
related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon
the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance,
transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales
as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above
the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:
2020 2019
 (in millions)
Capacity and other $ 476 $ 529 
Energy 1,469 1,623
Total $ 1,945 $ 2,152 
In 2020, wholesale electric revenues decreased $207 million, or 9.6%, as compared to the prior year due to decreases of $154
million in energy revenues and $53 million in capacity revenues. Energy revenues decreased $98 million at Southern Power and
$56 million at the traditional electric operating companies. The decrease at Southern Power primarily resulted from a net decrease
in the volume of KWHs sold due to decreased demand and lower natural gas prices, partially offset by increases in sales from solar
facilities, wind facilities, and fuel cell generation. The decrease at the traditional electric operating companies was primarily due to
lower energy prices. The decrease in capacity revenues was primarily related to the sales of Southern Power's Plant Mankato in the
first quarter 2020 and Southern Power's Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements for
additional information.
Other Electric Revenues
Other electric revenues increased $36 million, or 5.7%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an
increase of $23 million in transmission revenues, an increase of $15 million from outdoor lighting at Georgia Power, and an
increase of $10 million in energy service revenues at Alabama Power, as well as an increase of $6 million from pole attachment
agreements at Alabama Power and Georgia Power. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $26 million largely
resulting from the temporary suspension of customer disconnections and late fees related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2020 and
the percent change from the prior year were as follows:
2020
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted
Percent Change
(in billions)
Residential 47.4 (2.2)% 3.1 %
Commercial 45.4 (7.5) (5.7)
Industrial 47.0 (6.2) (6.2)
Other 0.7 (9.5) (9.3)
Total retail 140.5 (5.3) (3.0)%
Wholesale 45.7 (4.9)
Total energy sales 186.2 (5.2)%
(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated by removing from KWH sales the effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions, based on statistical
models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable
service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence
of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy sales decreased 4.4 billion KWHs in 2020 as compared to the prior year largely due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Weather-adjusted residential usage increases are primarily due to customer growth and an increase in
average customer usage, primarily due to work-from-home policies. Weather-adjusted commercial usage decreases are primarily
due to lower customer usage resulting from changes in consumer and business behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Industrial usage decreases are primarily a result of disruptions in supply chain and business operations related to the COVID-19
pandemic and the overall decrease in business activity due to the resulting recession.
See "Electric Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price
and KWH sales.(*)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Other Revenues
Other revenues increased $14 million, or 6.3%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increases
in unregulated sales of products and services of $9 million at Georgia Power and $5 million at Alabama Power.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale
market.
Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows:
2020 2019
Total generation (in billions of KWHs) 176 187 
Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs) 18 18 
Sources of generation (percent) —
Gas 53 52 
Coal 18 22 
Nuclear 17 16 
Hydro 4 3 
Wind, Solar, and Other 8 7 
Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —

Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) 1.95 2.20 
Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH) 4.65 4.66 
(*)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
In 2020, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.8 billion, a decrease of $672 million, or 15.1%, as compared to the prior
year. The decrease was primarily the result of a $363 million decrease in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased and a $309
million decrease primarily in the average cost of fuel.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues
and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses
incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net
income.
Fuel
In 2020, fuel expense was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $655 million, or 18.1%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was
primarily due to a 23.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 15.3% decrease in the average cost of natural gas
per KWH generated, and a 2.5% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in
the average cost of coal per KWH generated.
Purchased Power
In 2020, purchased power expense was $799 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 2.1%, as compared to the prior year. The
decrease was primarily due to a 2.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased.
Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the
market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $253 million, or 5.6%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease
reflects the impacts of cost containment activities implemented in 2020 to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease primarily results from decreases of $195 million in transmission and
distribution expenses at the traditional electric operating companies, including $37 million of increases in reliability NDR credits at
Alabama Power, $180 million in scheduled generation outage and maintenance expenses, and $32 million in compliance and
environmental expenses at the traditional electric operating companies, partially offset by a $183 million increase in storm damage
recovery at Georgia Power as authorized in the 2019 ARP and a $45 million increase in employee compensation and benefit
expenses. The decrease also reflects a $32 million increase in nuclear property insurance refunds at Alabama Power and Georgia
Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate NDR" and "Georgia Power – Storm Damage
Recovery" for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $469 million, or 19.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increase was due to
increased amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs of $203 million and higher depreciation of $178 million as
authorized in Georgia Power's 2019 ARP, as well as an increase of $104 million in depreciation associated with additional plant in
service. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional information.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
In the second and fourth quarters 2020, estimated probable losses of $149 million and $176 million, respectively, were recorded to
reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, Net
Gain on dispositions, net increased $21 million in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily related to the sale of Plant Mankato
in the first quarter 2020 and the sale of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements
under "Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants" for additional information.
Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $17 million, or 14.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year
primarily associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements
under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters" for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $81 million, or 34.6%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily related to a $131
million increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income, partially offset by a $24 million net decrease associated
with a 2019 litigation settlement at Southern Power and a $21 million increase in charitable donations, primarily at Georgia Power.
See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes decreased $191 million, or 27.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to $208
million of flowback of excess deferred income taxes in 2020 as authorized in Georgia Power's 2019 ARP and a $90 million
decrease associated with lower pre-tax earnings, primarily from charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 at Georgia Power, partially offset by a $75 million income tax benefit in 2019 resulting from ITCs recognized upon the sale
of Plant Nacogdoches and a $24 million net increase related to the application of an accounting order associated with the Tax
Reform Legislation in the prior year at Alabama Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans"
and – "Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Substantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling
interests increased $21 million in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increased loss was primarily due to an allocation to the
noncontrolling interest partner of approximately $26 million of income related to a litigation settlement at Southern Power in 2019.

Seasonality of Results
During the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating
Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods
of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response
to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and
certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary
significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2020, the percentage of operating revenues and net income
generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 67.6% and 85.6%,
respectively. For 2019, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were 68.7% and
86.8%, respectively.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues in 2020 were $3.4 billion, a $358 million decrease compared to 2019. Details of operating revenues were as
follows:
2020
(in millions)
Operating revenues – prior year $ 3,792 
Estimated change resulting from –
Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes 186 
Gas costs and other cost recovery (319)
Wholesale gas services (220)
Other (5)
Operating revenues – current year $ 3,434 
Percent change (9.4)%
Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2020 compared to the prior year due to base rate increases and
continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs, including increases of $107 million at Nicor Gas
and $68 million at Atlanta Gas Light. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional
information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower
natural gas prices and lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or
revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution
rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas
revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution
utilities. See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
Revenues from wholesale gas services decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower derivative gains and decreased commercial activity
as a result of warmer weather.
Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in
Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities charge their
utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory
agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup,
subject to regulatory review. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural
gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to
customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets
and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues
generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.
Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 88.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2020.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost
of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market
value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Cost of natural gas was $1.0 billion, a decrease of $347 million, or 26.3%, in 2020 compared to the prior year, which reflects a
23.6% decrease in natural gas prices compared to 2019 and decreased volumes primarily as a result of warmer weather.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $78 million, or 8.8%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $40 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $10 million in charitable donations, $12 million

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
in pipeline repair, compliance, and maintenance activities, and $19 million in expenses passed through directly to customers
primarily related to bad debt.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $13 million, or 2.7%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due
to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information.
Impairment Charges
In 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded impairment charges of $91 million related to Jefferson Island and $24 million in
contemplation of the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Notes 3 and 15 to the financial statements
under "Other Matters – Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Gas," respectively, for additional information.
(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, Net
In 2020, gain on dispositions, net was $22 million resulting from the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
Earnings from equity method investments decreased $16 million, or 10.2%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This decrease was
primarily due to a $12 million decrease in earnings from SNG as a result of lower demand and firm revenues and a $9 million
decrease in earnings as a result of the sale of Atlantic Coast Pipeline in the first quarter 2020, partially offset by a $6 million pre-tax
loss on the sale of Triton in May 2019. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $21 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from an
increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $43 million, or 33.1%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the reversal
of a federal income tax valuation allowance in connection with the sale of Triton in 2019, a decrease in the flowback of excess
deferred income taxes in 2020 at Atlanta Gas Light as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, and higher pre-tax earnings. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas," Note 10 to the financial statements, and Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Other Business Activities
Southern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to
business units); PowerSecure, a provider of energy solutions to electric utilities and their customers in the areas of distributed
generation, energy storage and renewables, and energy efficiency; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects, including
leveraged lease projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company
system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.

Operating Revenues
Southern Company's operating revenues for these other business activities decreased $88 million, or 16.5%, in 2020 as compared to
the prior year primarily from the sales of PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business in July 2019 and its lighting
business in December 2019, as well as the wind-down of a segment of PowerSecure's distributed infrastructure business in the first
quarter 2020. These decreases were partially offset by PowerSecure's continued growth in the core distributed infrastructure
business and an increase at Southern Linc related to a contract for the design and construction of a fiber optic system. See Note 15
to the financial statements under "Southern Company" for additional information.
Cost of Other Sales
Cost of other sales for these other business activities decreased $125 million, or 34.8%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year
primarily from the sales of PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business in July 2019 and its lighting business in December
2019, as well as the wind-down of a segment of PowerSecure's distributed infrastructure business in the first quarter 2020. These
decreases were partially offset by PowerSecure's continued growth in the core distributed infrastructure business. See Note 15 to
the financial statements under "Southern Company" for additional information.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses for these other business activities decreased $35 million, or 15.2%, in 2020 as
compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the sales of PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business in
July 2019 and its lighting business in December 2019, partially offset by an increase at Southern Linc related to the design and
construction of a fiber optic system. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company" for additional information.
Impairment Charges
In 2019, goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $50 million were recorded related to the sale of PowerSecure's utility
infrastructure services business and in contemplation of the sale of its lighting business. See Note 15 to the financial statements
under "Southern Company" for additional information.
(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, Net

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Interest Expense
Interest expense for these other business activities increased $97 million, or 18.8%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily
due to an increase in average outstanding long-term borrowings and fees associated with the extinguishment of debt at the parent
company. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Impairment of Leveraged Leases
Impairment charges totaling $206 million were recorded in 2020 related to leveraged lease investments at Southern Holdings. See
Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under "Leveraged Leases" and "Other Matters – Southern Company," respectively, for
additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net for these other business activities decreased $6 million, or 66.7%, in 2020 as compared to the prior
year primarily due to a $32 million increase in charitable donations at the parent company, partially offset by a $15 million increase
in leveraged lease income at Southern Holdings, primarily due to an impairment charge in 2019, and a $9 million increase related
to investment income at Southern Holdings.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
Income taxes for these other business activities decreased $1.3 billion in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the tax
impacts related to the sale of Gulf Power. See Note 10 to the financial statements and Note 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Company" for additional information.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power's 2020 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $1.15 billion, representing an $80 million, or 7.5%,
increase over the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in operations and maintenance expenses, an increase
in retail revenues associated with the impact of customer bill credits issued in 2019 related to the Tax Reform Legislation, and an
increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. These increases to income were partially offset by decreases in
retail revenues associated with milder weather in 2020 when compared to 2019 and lower customer usage in the industrial and
commercial sectors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues for 2020 were $5.8 billion, reflecting a $295 million decrease from 2019. Details of operating revenues were as
follows:
2020 2019
(in millions)
Retail — prior year $ 5,501 
Estimated change resulting from —
Rates and pricing 51 
Sales decline (50)
Weather (105)

Retail — current year $ 5,213 $ 5,501 
Wholesale revenues —
Non-affiliates 269 258 
Affiliates 46 81 
Total wholesale revenues 315 339 
Other operating revenues 302 285 
Total operating revenues $ 5,830 $ 6,125 
Percent change (4.8)% 1.5 %
Retail revenues in 2020 were $5.2 billion. These revenues decreased $288 million, or 5.2%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year.
The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to fuel and other cost recovery driven by decreases in generation and the average cost of
fuel, milder weather in 2020 when compared to 2019, and a decline in commercial and industrial sales due to social distancing and
safer-at-home guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by customer bill credits issued
in 2019 related to the Tax Reform Legislation and an increase in Rate CNP Compliance revenue in 2020.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" and " – Rate CNP Compliance" for additional
information. See "Energy Sales" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales
decline and weather.
Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama
PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and
other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate
ECR" for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:
2020 2019
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 127 $ 102 
Energy 142 156 
Total non-affiliated $ 269 $ 258 
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared
to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company
system's electric service territory, and availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy
revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-
term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at
market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.
In 2020, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $11 million, or 4.3%, as compared to the prior year primarily due
to a $25 million increase in non-affiliated capacity revenues as a result of a new power sales agreement which began in

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
September 2020, partially offset by a 17% decrease in the price of energy due to lower natural gas prices. See Notes 2 and 15 to the
financial statements under "Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity" and "Alabama Power,"
respectively, for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy
purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.
In 2020, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $35 million, or 43.2%, as compared to the prior year. In 2020, KWH
sales decreased 30% due to decreased generation related to lower demand and the price of energy decreased 18.4% as a result of
lower natural gas prices.
In 2020, other operating revenues increased $17 million, or 6.0%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in
transmission and energy service revenues and unregulated sales of products and services, partially offset by decreased revenues
resulting from the temporary suspension of customer disconnections and late fees related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2020 and
the percent change from the prior year were as follows:
2020
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted
Percent Change

Wholesale
Non-affiliates 6.3 23.8 
Affiliates 2.5 (30.0)
Total wholesale 8.8 1.9 
Total energy sales 59.4 (5.4)%
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in 2020 when compared to 2019 largely due to the COVID-19
pandemic. In 2020, weather-adjusted residential KWH sales were 2.7% higher compared to 2019 primarily due to COVID-19
pandemic impacts. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 6.3% primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from
social distancing and safer-at-home guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial KWH sales decreased 8.0% primarily
as a result of disruptions in supply chain and business operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and
wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the
availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

(a)KWHs generated by hydro are excluded from the average cost of fuel, generated.
(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the
provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $226 million, or 14.9%, compared to 2019. The
decrease was primarily due to a $189 million decrease related to the volume of KWHs purchased and generated and a $37 million
net decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC,
continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2
to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate ECR" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expenses were $970 million in 2020, a decrease of $142 million, or 12.8%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due
to a 23.1% decrease in the average cost of KWHs generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements, a 15.6% decrease in
the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 14.2% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro.
Purchased Power – Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $191 million in 2020, a decrease of $12 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to a 6.4% decrease in the amount of energy purchased as a result of milder weather during 2020 as
compared to 2019, partially offset by a 1.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to decreased generation from
PPAs.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the
Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the
availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power – Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $128 million in 2020, a decrease of $72 million, or 36.0%, compared to 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to a 41.9% decrease in the amount of energy purchased primarily related to milder weather during 2020
as compared to 2019. This decrease was partially offset by a 10.3% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to
decreased generation from PPAs.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual
agreements, as approved by the FERC.(a)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2020, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $202 million, or 11.1%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease
reflects the impact of cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $88 million in generation expenses, $27 million in
vegetation management costs, $27 million in accruals to the NDR, and $20 million in Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses, as
well as a $37 million increase in reliability NDR credits. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate
NDR" and " – Rate CNP Compliance" for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net increased $54 million, or 117.4%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in
non-service cost-related retirements benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased $67 million, or 24.8%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in pre-tax net
income and the application in 2019 of an Alabama PSC accounting order related to the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Alabama Power – Tax Reform Accounting Order" for additional information.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's 2020 net income was $1.6 billion, representing a $145 million, or 8.4%, decrease from the previous year. The
decrease was primarily due to after-tax charges totaling $242 million in 2020 related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4, as well as lower retail revenues associated with milder weather as compared to 2019 and decreased customer usage resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by related cost containment activities and the impacts of accruals in 2019 for
customer refunds. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information
on the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Percent change (1.2)% (0.1)%
Retail revenues of $7.6 billion in 2020 decreased $98 million, or 1.3%, compared to 2019. The significant factors driving this
change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to an increase in revenue recognized
under the ECCR tariff effective January 1, 2020 as authorized in the 2019 ARP and the impacts of accruals in 2019 for customer
refunds related to the Tax Reform Legislation and earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range, as well as the rate pricing
effects of decreased customer usage throughout 2020 in the commercial and industrial classes. Partially offsetting these increases
were lower contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing. See Note 2 to the
financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional information.
See "Energy Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales decline in
2020.
Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power
costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.
Wholesale revenues from power sales were as follows:
2020 2019
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 51 $ 55 
Energy 64 85 
Total $ 115 $ 140 
Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of
fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the
market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation,
demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company
system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or
decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based
rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions
do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.
In 2020, wholesale revenues decreased $25 million, or 17.9%, as compared to 2019 primarily due to the expiration of a non-
affiliate PPA and lower energy prices.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Other operating revenues increased $24 million, or 4.3%, in 2020 from the prior year primarily due to increases of $33 million in
unregulated sales associated with power delivery construction and maintenance contracts and outdoor lighting, $8 million in pole
attachment revenues, and $6 million in open access transmission tariff sales, partially offset by decreases of $13 million largely
resulting from the temporary suspension of customer disconnections and late fees related to the COVID-19 pandemic and $10
million from unregulated sales associated with energy conservation projects.
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2020 and
the percent change from the prior year were as follows:

Total retail 80.8 (4.6) (2.2)%
Wholesale 2.7 (9.8)
Total energy sales 83.5 (4.8)%
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in 2020 when compared to 2019 largely due to the COVID-19
pandemic. In 2020, weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 3.4% compared to 2019 primarily due to customer growth
and an increase in average customer usage, primarily due to work-from-home policies. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales
decreased 5.3% primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from changes in consumer and business behavior in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales decreased 4.5% primarily as a result of disruptions in supply
chain and business operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated
companies.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
Fuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is
determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia
Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH) 3.69 4.21 
(*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.
Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $350 million, or 13.8%, compared to 2019. The
decrease was due to a decrease of $215 million related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a net decrease of $135
million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally
offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense was $1.1 billion in 2020, a decrease of $303 million, or 21.0%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to
a 40.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal and a 9.5% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH
generated.
Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates
Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $540 million in 2020, an increase of $19 million, or 3.6%, compared to 2019.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of 4.7% in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily due to the availability of lower
cost market resources, partially offset by a 2.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily resulting from lower
energy prices.
Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the
Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and
the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.
Purchased Power - Affiliates
Purchased power expense from affiliates was $509 million in 2020, a decrease of $66 million, or 11.5%, compared to 2019. The
decrease was primarily due to the expiration of a PPA and a 19.9% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily
resulting from lower energy prices, partially offset by an increase of 4.4% in the volume of KWHs purchased due to lower cost
Southern Company system resources as compared to available Georgia Power-owned generation.
Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual
agreements, all as approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2020, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $19 million, or 1.0%, compared to 2019. The decrease was
primarily due to decreases of $85 million in distribution- and transmission-related expenses, $78 million associated with(*)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
generation maintenance and scheduled outages, $19 million in customer service and sales expense, and $12 million associated with
generation environmental projects. These decreases reflect the impacts of cost containment activities implemented to help offset the
effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Other expense reductions include a decrease of $15
million related to an adjustment in 2019 for FERC fees following the conclusion of a multi-year audit of headwater benefits
associated with hydro facilities and an $11 million increase in nuclear property insurance refunds. Partially offsetting these
decreases were increases of $183 million in storm damage recovery as authorized in the 2019 ARP and $20 million in employee
benefit expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Storm Damage Recovery" for additional
information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $444 million, or 45.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase primarily reflects
increased amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs of $203 million and higher depreciation of $178 million as
authorized in the 2019 ARP. Also contributing to the increase was a $67 million increase in depreciation associated with additional
plant in service. See Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP" and "Depreciation
and Amortization," respectively, for additional information.
Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
In the second and fourth quarters 2020, estimated probable losses of $149 million and $176 million, respectively, were recorded to
reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
In 2020, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $16 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily
due to a $36 million increase in interest expense associated with an increase in average outstanding long-term borrowings, partially
offset by a $20 million increase in amounts capitalized in connection with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein for additional information
on borrowings and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information
regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Other Income (Expense), Net
In 2020, other income (expense), net increased $40 million, or 28.6%, compared to the prior year primarily due to a $42 million
increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and a $23 million increase in AFUDC equity primarily associated
with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, partially offset by a $20 million increase in charitable donations. See Note 11 to
the financial statements for additional information on Georgia Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs
and Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information regarding Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Income Taxes
Income taxes decreased $320 million, or 67.8%, in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the flowback of excess
deferred income taxes in 2020 as authorized in the 2019 ARP and lower pre-tax earnings, which includes the charges in the second
and fourth quarters 2020 associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements
under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's net income was $152 million in 2020 compared to $139 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a
decrease in operations and maintenance expenses primarily associated with a 2019 accrual for the closeout of a DOE contract
related to the Kemper County energy facility, a decrease in income taxes associated with the flowback of excess deferred income
taxes, and a decrease in amortization associated with ECO Plan regulatory assets, substantially offset by a decrease in revenues as a
result of a base rate reduction that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2020, as well as a decrease in customer usage
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Total retail revenues for 2020 decreased $56 million, or 6.4%, compared to 2019 primarily due to decreases in rates in accordance
with the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement, a decrease in customer usage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a
decrease in fuel and other cost recovery revenues primarily as a result of lower recoverable fuel costs.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case" for additional information. See "Energy
Sales" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.
Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy
component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy
component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power
expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi

Power's service territory. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery" for additional
information.
Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based
sales, were as follows:
2020 2019
(in millions)
Capacity and other $ 3 $ 3 
Energy 212 234 
Total non-affiliated $ 215 $ 237 
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared
to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern
Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and
decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have
a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric
cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs
which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.3% of Mississippi
Power's total operating revenues in 2020 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these
wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed
by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These
opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to
produce the energy.
Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $22 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily
due to decreases in revenue from MRA customers as a result of lower fuel costs, milder weather, decreased customer usage as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and fewer opportunity sales.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at
each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $21 million, or 15.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was
primarily due to a $34 million decrease associated with lower natural gas prices, partially offset by a $13 million increase
associated with higher KWH sales due to the dispatch of Mississippi Power's generation resources to serve the Southern Company
system's territorial load.
Other operating revenues increased $7 million, or 38.9%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in open
access transmission tariff revenues.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Energy Sales
Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2020 and
the percent change from the prior year were as follows:
2020
Total
KWHsTotal KWH
Percent ChangeWeather-Adjusted

Affiliated 5,226 9.8 
Total wholesale 9,010 3.3 
Total energy sales 18,139 (1.1)%
Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of
customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in 2020 when compared to 2019 largely due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 3.3% compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in average
customer usage as a result of changes in customer behavior and work-from-home policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 7.0% primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from changes in
consumer and business behavior, including the temporary closure of casinos, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial
KWH sales decreased 4.9% primarily as a result of disruptions in supply chain and business operations driven by the COVID-19
pandemic and the overall decrease in business activity due to the resulting recession.
See "Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies.
Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the
availability of generating units. Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale
market.
Details of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:
2020 2019

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally
offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery and Note 1 to the financial statements under "Fuel Costs" for additional information.
Fuel
Fuel expense decreased $57 million, or 14.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a 12.6% decrease in the average cost of
natural gas per KWH generated, a 10.7% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, and a 3.0% decrease in the
volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.
Purchased Power
Purchased power expense increased $2 million, or 10.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily the result of a
30.2% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by an 11.9% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased.
Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company
system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the
Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as
approved by the FERC.
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $23 million, or 7.5%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. The decrease
primarily reflects the impacts of a $23 million accrual in 2019 for the closeout of a DOE contract related to the Kemper County
energy facility. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"
for additional information.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased $9 million, or 4.7%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in regulatory asset amortization of $21 million primarily as a result of completing amortization of the ECO Plan
regulatory asset in 2019. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation of $12 million related to additional plant
in service and an increase in depreciation rates in accordance with the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case" and " – Environmental Compliance Overview
Plan" for additional information.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $11 million, or 9.7%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in ad valorem
taxes.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $9 million, or 13.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as the result of a
decrease in outstanding long-term borrowings. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
Income tax expense decreased $16 million, or 53.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the flowback of excess deferred
income taxes as a result of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
"Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Southern Power
Net income attributable to Southern Power for 2020 was $238 million, a $101 million decrease from 2019, primarily due to the $88
million after-tax gain on the sale of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019, partially offset by the $23 million after-tax gain
on the sale of Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020. In addition, the decrease reflects the reduced net income resulting from these
dispositions. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants" for
additional information.

Operating Revenues
Total operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural
gas facilities and a biomass generating facility (through the second quarter 2019 sale of Plant Nacogdoches), and PPA energy
revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it
may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it
may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.
Natural Gas and Biomass Capacity and Energy Revenue
Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed
costs plus a return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the
energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy
compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start
charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied
by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.
Solar and Wind Energy Revenue
Southern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have
capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a
fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to
recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these
facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements" herein for additional information
regarding Southern Power's PPAs.

Operating Revenues Details
Details of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows:
2020 2019
(in millions)
PPA capacity revenues $ 384 $ 482 
PPA energy revenues 1,019 1,081 
Total PPA revenues 1,403 1,563 
Non-PPA revenues 316 363 
Other revenues 14 12 
Total operating revenues $ 1,733 $ 1,938 
Operating revenues for 2020 were $1.7 billion, a $205 million, or 11%, decrease from 2019. The decrease in operating revenues
was primarily due to the following:
•PPA capacity revenues decreased $98 million, or 20%, primarily due to decreases of $72 million related to the dispositions of
Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019 and Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020 and $24 million from the contractual
expiration of an affiliate natural gas PPA.
•PPA energy revenues decreased $62 million, or 6%, primarily due to a $125 million decrease in sales from natural gas facilities
resulting from an $89 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold due to decreased demand and a $36 million decrease in the
price of fuel and purchased power. This decrease was partially offset by increases of $33 million in sales primarily driven by the
volume of KWHs generated by solar and wind facilities and $30 million in sales from fuel cell generation acquired in 2019.
•Non-PPA revenues decreased $47 million, or 13%, due to a $99 million decrease in the market price of energy, partially offset
by a $52 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales.

Generation 44 47
Purchased power 3 3
Total generation and purchased power 47 (6)% 50
Total generation and purchased power (excluding solar , wind, and tolling agreements) 28 (3)% 29
Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel
(tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under
such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues
and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are
not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power
pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.
Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the
Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on
an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate
company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.

Fuel $ 470 $ 577 
Purchased power 74 108 
Total fuel and purchased power expenses $ 544 $ 685 
In 2020, total fuel and purchased power expenses decreased $141 million, or 21%, compared to 2019. Fuel expense decreased $107
million, or 19%, due to an $82 million decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated and a $25 million decrease
associated with the volume of KWHs generated. Purchased power expense decreased $34 million, or 31%, due to a $21 million
decrease associated with the average cost of purchased power and a $13 million decrease associated with the volume of KWHs
purchased.
(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, Net
In 2020, gain on dispositions, net increased $16 million, or 70%, compared to 2019 reflecting the sale of Plant Mankato in the first
quarter 2020 and the sale of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements under
"Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants" for additional information.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
In 2020, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $18 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease
in the amount of outstanding debt. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
In 2020, other income (expense), net decreased $28 million, or 60%, compared to 2019 primarily due to a $36 million gain arising
from a litigation settlement in 2019, partially offset by the resolution of certain related contingencies in the third quarter 2020.
Income Taxes (Benefit)
In 2020, income tax expense was $3 million compared to a $56 million benefit for 2019, a change of $59 million, primarily due to a
$75 million income tax benefit in 2019 resulting from ITCs recognized upon the sale of Plant Nacogdoches, partially offset by a
decrease in income tax expense as a result of lower pre-tax earnings in 2020. See Notes 1, 10, and 15 to the financial statements
under "Income Taxes," "Effective Tax Rate," and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
In 2020, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $21 million compared to 2019. The increased loss was primarily
due to an allocation to the noncontrolling interest partner of approximately $26 million of income related to a litigation settlement
in 2019.
Southern Company Gas
Operating Metrics
Southern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and
volumes of natural gas sold.
Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating
Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has
various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its
exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory, including Nicor Gas following
the approval of a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers in its base rate case that concluded in 2019. Southern
Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.
The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices,

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects
of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural
gas volumes sold to its customers.
Seasonality of Results
During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the
gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale gas
services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern
Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs,
are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across
quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable
when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly
from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.

Net Income
Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2020 was $590 million, an increase of $5 million, or 0.9%, compared to the
prior year. This increase was primarily due to impairment charges in 2019 of $69 million related to Jefferson Island and $17 million
in contemplation of the sale of interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a $16 million gain in 2020 related to the sale of
Jefferson Island, and a $53 million increase at gas distribution operations primarily due to base rate increases for all of the natural
gas distribution utilities and continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs, partially offset by reduced flowback of
excess deferred income taxes at Atlanta Gas Light in 2020. These increases were partially offset by a $149 million decrease at
wholesale gas services in 2020 primarily due to lower commercial activity and lower derivative gains. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues in 2020 were $3.4 billion, a $358 million decrease compared to 2019. Details of operating revenues were as
follows:
2020
(in millions)
Operating revenues – prior year $ 3,792

Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes 186 
Gas costs and other cost recovery (319)
Wholesale gas services (220)
Other (5)
Operating revenues – current year $ 3,434 
Percent change (9.4)%
Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2020 compared to the prior year due to base rate increases and
continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs, including increases of $107 million at Nicor Gas
and $68 million at Atlanta Gas Light. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional
information.
Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower
natural gas prices and lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or
revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution
rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas
revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations.
See "Cost of Natural Gas" herein for additional information.
Revenues from wholesale gas services decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower derivative gains and decreased commercial activity
as a result of warmer weather. See "Segment Information – Wholesale Gas Services" herein for additional information.
Heating Degree Days
During Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher. Weather typically does not have a
significant net income impact other than during the Heating Season. The following table presents Heating Degree Days information
for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.

(*)Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. December 31, 2020 also includes approximately 50,000 customers in Ohio
contracted through an annual auction process to serve for 12 months beginning April 1, 2020.
Southern Company Gas anticipates continued customer growth as it expects continued low natural gas prices. Southern Company
Gas uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility
customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies.
Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to
regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount
of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers
prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued
natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal
the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas
distribution operations represented 88.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2020.
Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost
of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market
value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
In 2020, cost of natural gas was $1.0 billion, a decrease of $347 million, or 26.3%, compared to the prior year, which reflects a
23.6% decrease in natural gas prices compared to 2019 and decreased volumes primarily as a result of warmer weather.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses
In 2020, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $78 million, or 8.8%, compared to the prior year. The increase was
primarily due to increases of $40 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $10 million in charitable donations, $12 million in
pipeline repair, compliance, and maintenance activities, and $19 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily
related to bad debt.
Depreciation and Amortization
In 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $13 million, or 2.7%, compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due
to continued infrastructure investments at gas distribution operations. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern
Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional information.
Impairment Charges
In 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded impairment charges of $91 million related to Jefferson Island and $24 million in
contemplation of the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Notes 3 and 15 to the financial statements
under "Other Matters – Southern Company Gas" and "Southern Company Gas," respectively, for additional information.
(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, Net
In 2020, gain on dispositions, net was $22 million resulting from the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Earnings from Equity Method Investments
In 2020, earnings from equity method investments decreased $16 million, or 10.2%, compared to the prior year. This decrease was
primarily due to a $12 million decrease in earnings from SNG as a result of lower demand and firm revenues and a $9 million
decrease in earnings as a result of the sale of Atlantic Coast Pipeline in the first quarter 2020, partially offset by a $6 million pre-tax
loss on the sale of Triton in May 2019. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for
additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
In 2020, other income (expense), net increased $21 million compared to the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from an
increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes
In 2020, income taxes increased $43 million, or 33.1%, compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the reversal
of a federal income tax valuation allowance in connection with the sale of Triton in 2019, a decrease in the flowback of excess
deferred income taxes in 2020 at Atlanta Gas Light as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, and higher pre-tax earnings. See
Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas," Note 10 to the financial statements, and Note 15 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Performance and Non-GAAP Measures
Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues less cost of natural gas, cost of other
sales, and revenue tax expense. Adjusted operating margin excludes other operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and
amortization, taxes other than income taxes, impairment charges, and (gain) loss on dispositions, net, which are included in the
calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected in the statements of income. The presentation
of adjusted operating margin is believed to provide useful information regarding the contribution resulting from base rate changes,
infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects, and customer growth at gas distribution operations since the cost of
natural gas and revenue tax expense can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to customers. Southern Company Gas
further believes that utilizing adjusted operating margin at gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing
services allows it to focus on a direct measure of performance before overhead costs. The applicable reconciliation of operating
income to adjusted operating margin is provided herein.
Adjusted operating margin should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, Southern Company Gas'
operating performance than operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Southern Company Gas'
adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Gas Distribution Operations
Gas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight
by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern
Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed
and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a
reasonable return on its investments.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas
market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the
earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather
conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas
consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization
mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather
changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories.
In 2020, net income increased $53 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year. The increase primarily relates to $191 million in
adjusted operating margin which reflects base rate increases for all of the natural gas distribution utilities and continued
investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs. The $109 million increase in operating expenses includes
increases for compensation and benefit expenses and pipeline compliance as well as bad debt costs passed through directly to
customers. The increase also reflects higher depreciation primarily due to additional assets placed in service. The $27 million
increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. The $51 million
increase in income tax expense is primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and a decrease in the flowback of excess deferred
income taxes at Atlanta Gas Light as authorized by the Georgia PSC.

information on retirement benefits.
Gas Pipeline Investments
Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, PennEast Pipeline,
Dalton Pipeline, and Atlantic Coast Pipeline (until its sale on March 24, 2020). Net income in 2020 increased $5 million, or 5%,
compared to the prior year. This increase primarily relates to a $25 million decrease in income taxes primarily related to a 2019
increase associated with changes in state apportionment rates, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in earnings from SNG and
a $9 million decrease in earnings as a result of the sale of the interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial
statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Wholesale Gas Services
Wholesale gas services is involved in asset management and optimization, storage, transportation, producer and peaking services,
natural gas supply, natural gas services, and wholesale gas marketing. Southern Company Gas has positioned the business to
generate positive economic earnings on an annual basis even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number
of factors. When market price volatility increases, wholesale gas services is well positioned to capture significant value and
generate stronger results. Operating expenses primarily reflect employee compensation and benefits.
Net income in 2020 decreased $149 million, or 91%, compared to the prior year. This decrease primarily relates to a $200 million
decrease in adjusted operating margin, partially offset by a $49 million decrease in income taxes due to lower pre-tax earnings.
Details of adjusted operating margin are provided in the table below.

Adjusted operating margin $ 73 $ 273 
Change in Commercial Activity
The commercial activity at wholesale gas services includes recognition of storage and transportation values that were generated in
prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions occur. The
decrease in commercial activity in 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to warmer-than-normal weather conditions
and tightening transportation spreads.
Change in Storage and Transportation Derivatives
Volatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand
for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on Southern
Company Gas' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of wholesale gas
services to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Forward storage or time spreads applicable to the locations of
wholesale gas services' specific storage positions in 2020 resulted in storage derivative gains. Transportation and forward
commodity derivative gains in 2020 are primarily the result of narrowing transportation spreads due to supply constraints and
increases in natural gas supply, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points, primarily in the Northeast
and Midwest regions.
The natural gas that wholesale gas services purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas
daily or spot prices at the end of the year. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Natural Gas for Sale" for additional
information.
Withdrawal Schedule and Physical Transportation Transactions
The expected natural gas withdrawals from storage and expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with the
transportation portfolio of wholesale gas services are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues

delivery points. Wholesale gas services' expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, as
well as other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt, and delivery charges, and exclude estimated profit sharing under asset management
agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned
physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points, and forward natural gas prices at December 31,
2020. A portion of wholesale gas services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures
contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues.

Gas Marketing Services
Gas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice
programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas
supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is
weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools,
to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.
Net income increased $6 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase primarily relates to a $6 million increase
in adjusted operating margin, which primarily reflects recovery of prior period hedge losses.
All Other
All other includes natural gas storage businesses, including Jefferson Island through its sale on December 1, 2020, fuels operations
through the sale of Southern Company Gas' interest in Pivotal LNG on March 24, 2020, the investment in Triton through its sale on
May 29, 2019, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that
are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements.
Net loss decreased $90 million, or 98%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects a $146 million
decrease in operating expenses primarily related to impairment charges in 2019 of $91 million related to Jefferson Island and $24
million in contemplation of the sale of Southern Company Gas' interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Also included
was the $22 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Jefferson Island and a $5 million increase in earnings from equity method
investments primarily due to a pre-tax loss on the sale of Triton in 2019, partially offset by a $65 million increase in income taxes
as a result of lower pre-tax losses. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" for additional
information.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL
General
Prices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distributed by the natural gas
distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based
regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for
wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC.
Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about
regulatory matters.
Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities
described in Note 15 to the financial statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants'
future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary
businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.
For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments
that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, continued customer growth, and the
trend of reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and related cost recovery proceedings is another major factor.
Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the
adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce
transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.
Global and U.S. economic conditions have been significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that have caused a
global and national economic recession. Most prominently, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted global supply chains
and global demand for goods and services and public policy responses of social distancing and closing non-essential businesses
have further restricted economic activity. The drivers, speed, and depth of this economic contraction are unprecedented and have
reduced energy demand across the Southern Company system's service territory, primarily in the commercial and industrial classes.
The negative impacts, which started in late-March 2020, of the COVID-19 pandemic and related recession on the Southern
Company system's retail electric sales began to improve in the middle of May 2020; however, retail electric revenues declined
slightly in 2020 compared to 2019. Recovery is expected to continue into the second half of 2021, but responses to the(a)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
COVID-19 pandemic by both customers and governments could significantly affect the pace of recovery. The ultimate extent of the
negative impact on revenues depends on the depth and duration of the economic contraction in the Southern Company system's
service territory and cannot be determined at this time. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on COVID-19-
related impacts on energy demand in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2020.
The traditional electric operating companies have established installment payment plans to allow customers to repay over a period
of time past due accounts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information
on the status of disconnections and the deferral of costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic at Georgia Power, Mississippi
Power, and the natural gas distribution utilities. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including
Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other
energy projects while containing costs, as well as regulatory matters, creditworthiness of customers, total electric generating
capacity available in Southern Power's market areas, and Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current
contracts expire. In addition, renewable portfolio standards, availability of tax credits, transmission constraints, cost of generation
from units within the Southern Company power pool, and operational limitations could influence Southern Power's future earnings.
The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary
businesses in the gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous
factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that
allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and
other construction projects, creditworthiness of customers, and Southern Company Gas' ability to optimize its transportation and
storage positions and to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern
Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern
Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads.
Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. Over the
longer term, volatility is expected to be low to moderate and locational and/or transportation spreads are expected to decrease as
new pipelines are built to reduce the existing supply constraints in the shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these
pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters – Southern
Company Gas – PennEast Pipeline Project" for additional information on permitting challenges experienced by the PennEast
Pipeline. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment, including a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices,
which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. In addition, if the COVID-
19 pandemic results in continued economic uncertainty for a sustained period, demand for natural gas may decrease, resulting in
further downward pressure on natural gas prices and lower volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.
Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather,
competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale
customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, government incentives
to reduce overall energy usage, the prices of electricity and natural gas, and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity
and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be
affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC.
The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2020 and are
generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any
changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide
array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving
other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some
combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and
regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly
affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern
Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of
businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Environmental Matters
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and
regulations governing air, water, land, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive
environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated
with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to
achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may
impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional
electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may
result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or
changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and
distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and
wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations
and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption
and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending
and/or future legal challenges.
New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The
impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings, cash flows,
and/or financial condition if such costs cannot continue to be recovered on a timely basis in rates for the traditional electric
operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power.
Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP
Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of
environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental
remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a
result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and
renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than
for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns,
including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the
availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about
potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating
facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA
provisions cannot be determined at this time.
Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural
gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and
industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the
potential to affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.
Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or
modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital
expenditures through 2025 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the
traditional electric operating companies are as follows:
2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Total
(in millions)
Southern Company $ 120 $ 145 $ 257 $ 255 $ 152 $ 929 
Alabama Power 67 78 78 99 70 392 
Georgia Power 34 42 164 151 59 450 
Mississippi Power 19 15 9 5 14 62 
These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See "Global Climate Issues"
herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash

pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable
Registrants' ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements" herein and Note 6 to the
financial statements for additional information.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Executive Orders
On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued a regulatory freeze that requires further reviews of certain regulatory actions
authorized under the previous administration before they become effective. President Biden also signed executive orders related to
federal regulations and subsequently signed additional orders to address climate change and other environmental issues.
Air Quality
The Southern Company system reduced SO and NO air emissions by 99% and 91%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019. The
Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by over 97% from 2005 to 2019.
The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various
federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress
toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States are
required to submit state implementation plans for the second 10-year planning period (2018 through 2028) by July 31, 2021. These
plans could require further reductions in particulate matter, SO, and/or NO, which could result in increased compliance costs at
affected electric generating units.
Water Quality
In 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake
structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants. The regulation requires plant-
specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms. The results of these plant-specific studies, which are
ongoing within the Southern Company system, are being submitted with each plant's next National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit cycle. The Southern Company system anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly
CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. The impact of this rule will
depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each
plant's NPDES permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.
In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards
for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs, including
substantially all of the coal-fired generating units in the Southern Company system. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent
discharges of certain wastestreams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater discharges. On
October 13, 2020, the EPA published the final ELG reconsideration rule, a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG Rule's limits on bottom
ash transport water and FGD wastewater that extends the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The
ELG reconsideration rule also updates the voluntary incentive program and provides new subcategories for low utilization electric
generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. An initial notice of planned
participation (NOPP) must be submitted to the applicable permitting authority no later than October 13, 2021 for units seeking to
qualify for these subcategories. A subsequent NOPP must be submitted to transfer a unit to an alternative compliance option. The
2015 ELG Rule and the ELG reconsideration rule (ELG rules) are expected to require capital expenditures and increased
operational costs for the traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For Georgia Power's Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2,
which are currently challenged due to their operating profiles and positions within the economic dispatch, the anticipated cost of the
controls necessary to comply with the ELG rules could accelerate a determination that continued operation is uneconomical. As a
result, Georgia Power may request in its 2022 IRP filing to accelerate the retirement of these units, which had a net book value
totaling approximately $665 million at December 31, 2020. However, the ultimate impact of the ELG rules will depend on the
Southern Company system's final assessment of compliance options, the incorporation of these assessments into each of the
traditional electric operating company's IRP processes, the incorporation of these new requirements into each generating unit's
NPDES permit, and the outcome of legal challenges. The ELG reconsideration rule has been challenged by several environmental
organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.2 X

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Coal Combustion Residuals
In 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in
landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash
ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing
landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. The
EPA is in the process of amending portions of the CCR Rule.
In addition to the CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the handling of CCR within
their respective states. The State of Georgia received approval from the EPA on its partial permit program implementing the state
CCR permit program in lieu of the federal self-implementing rule in accordance with the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the
Nation Act. On February 15, 2021, revisions to align State of Alabama regulations with the federal CCR Rule became effective, as
approved by the Alabama Environmental Management Commission. The State of Mississippi has not yet developed a state CCR
permit program.
Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules,
the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related
cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to ash pond closure methodologies,
schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the
closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies.
Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for
Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements," Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans," and Note 6 to
the financial statements for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of
waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur
substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies
to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their
financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional
electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of
Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable
state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory
mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory
agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup
costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental
Remediation" for additional information.
Global Climate Issues
In July 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule) to repeal and replace the CPP. The ACE Rule
requires states to develop unit-specific CO emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency
improvements. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded the ACE Rule back to the EPA. Once
the decision becomes final, the ACE Rule will no longer be in effect.
On January 20, 2021, President Biden accepted the Paris Agreement on behalf of the United States, which will result in the United
States officially becoming a party to the agreement on February 19, 2021. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding universal
framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in place a
process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years.
Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG
emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an
electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 18% coal and 53% natural gas in 2020, along with
over 10,000 MWs of renewable resource capacity. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system
retiring over 5,600 MWs of coal- and oil-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting over 3,400 MWs of generating
capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material
that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3 million
metric tons of CO equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.2

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
The following table provides the Registrants' 2019 and preliminary 2020 GHG emissions based on equity share of facilities:
2019 Preliminary 2020
(in million metric tons of CO equivalent)

(*)Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the
applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.
With 2007 as a baseline, in 2018, Southern Company system management established an interim goal of a 50% reduction in carbon
emissions by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. In 2020, Southern Company system management
updated the long-term GHG emissions reduction goal to net zero emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2020 emissions, the
Southern Company system achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 52% since 2007. In 2020, the combination of the
COVID-19 pandemic and relatively mild weather significantly reduced demand. As these factors fluctuate, coal generation and
GHG emissions may temporarily increase in future years. Southern Company system management expects to achieve sustained
GHG emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025. Southern Company system management, working with applicable
regulators, plans to transition its generating fleet in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other
stakeholders. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of
development of low- to no-carbon energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management will
continue to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue its
research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing
carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, and customers to support
outcomes leading to a net zero future.
Regulatory Matters
See OVERVIEW – "Recent Developments" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters
related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the
applicable registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
Construction Programs
The Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads
on their respective systems. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new
electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems,
and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.
For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to
be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.
Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity" for
information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.
See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's
acquisitions that involve construction of renewable energy facilities.
Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas
distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The
natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their
regulated rates. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement
Programs and Capital Projects" and "Other Matters – Southern Company Gas – PennEast Pipeline Project," respectively, for
additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.2

See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information regarding the
Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.
Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements
General
Southern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs,
municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide
Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.
Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable
substitute guarantee if (i) S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating,
(ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.
Southern Power is working to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale markets. During 2020, Southern Power continued to
be successful in remarketing 350 MWs to 1,130 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through
several PPAs extending over the next 17 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase
contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth. However, generation capacity market forecasts indicate
an oversupply, especially in the Southeast, and the highly competitive remarketing environment is expected to continue in the near
term.
Natural Gas
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of
agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a
portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or
block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power
serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from
Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the
requirements customers' resources when economically viable.
As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling
agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy
delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated
in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern
Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating
facility.
Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs
based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs,
Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Long-Term Service Agreements" for additional
information.
Solar and Wind
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind (renewable) generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs;
however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated
renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a
result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of
energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission
constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or
resell the renewable energy credits.
Southern Company Gas' Affiliate Asset Management Agreements
With the exception of Nicor Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities use asset management agreements with an affiliate, Sequent,
for the primary purpose of reducing utility customers' gas cost recovery rates through payments to the utilities by Sequent. For
Atlanta Gas Light, these payments are set by the Georgia PSC and are utilized for infrastructure improvements and to fund heating
assistance programs, rather than as a reduction to gas cost recovery rates. Under these asset management agreements, Sequent
supplies natural gas to the utility and markets available pipeline and storage capacity to improve the overall cost of supplying gas to
the utility customers. Currently, the natural gas distribution utilities primarily purchase their gas from

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Sequent. The purchase agreements require Sequent to provide firm gas to the natural gas distribution utilities, but the natural gas
distribution utilities maintain the right and ability to make their own long-term supply arrangements if they believe it is in the best
interest of their customers.
Each agreement provides for Sequent to make payments to the natural gas distribution utility through an annual minimum
guarantee within a profit sharing structure, a profit sharing structure without an annual minimum guarantee, or a fixed fee.
Income Tax Matters
Consolidated Income Taxes
The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to
utilize certain tax credits. See "Tax Credits" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Accounting for Income Taxes" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
Tax Credits
The Tax Reform Legislation, as modified by the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law in December 2020, retained
solar energy incentives of 30% ITC for projects that commenced construction by December 31, 2019; 26% ITC for projects that
commence construction in 2020 through 2022; 22% ITC for projects that commence construction in 2023; and a permanent 10%
ITC for projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2024, or projects which are placed in service after December 31,
2025 regardless of when construction began. In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation retained wind energy incentives for projects
that commenced construction in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 of 100% PTC, 80% PTC, 60% PTC, and 40% PTC, respectively. As a
result of a tax extenders bill passed in December 2019 and the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, projects that begin
construction in 2020 or 2021 are entitled to 60% PTC. Projects commencing construction after 2021 will not be entitled to any
PTCs. Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, and biomass
facilities primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.
Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10
years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern
Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2020, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.4 billion
and $1.1 billion, respectively, of unutilized ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2024, but could be
further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind and solar projects, where the tax
partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern
Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See
Note 1 to the financial statements under "General" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the
financial statements under "Income Taxes" and Note 10 to the financial statements under "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax
Credit Carryforwards" and "Effective Tax Rate" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the
tax benefit related to associated basis differences.
Alabama State Tax Reform Legislation
On February 12, 2021, the State of Alabama enacted tax legislation that changes the apportionment methodology effective for the
2021 tax year. This legislation is expected to reduce the amount of Southern Power's future earnings apportioned to the State of
Alabama and, thus, reduce Southern Power's existing state accumulated deferred tax liabilities, which would have a favorable
impact on Southern Power's net income. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
General Litigation and Other Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings,
cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any
subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not
specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate
liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial
statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being
litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the
notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on
the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein).
Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the
financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with
the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.
Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their
respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory
agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge
customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate
regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than
when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the
recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of
liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities
also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These
estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution
utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants
than they would on a non-regulated company.
Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2020 for the applicable Registrants
were as follows: 89% for Southern Company, 99% for Alabama Power, 96% for Georgia Power, 99% for Mississippi Power, and
86% for Southern Company Gas.
As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management
reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on
applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact
the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable
Registrants.
Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
(Southern Company and Georgia Power)
In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection
with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which
included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project
manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement
Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3
billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement
was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be
disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be
reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of
proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3
billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer
refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) prudence decisions would be made subsequent to
achieving fuel load for Unit 4.
In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM
report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.
As of December 31, 2020, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to $8.7 billion (net of $1.7 billion received
under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
construction contingency of $171 million and is based on the regulatory-approved in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3
and November 2022 for Unit 4. Since 2018, construction contingency totaling $0.5 billion has been assigned to the base capital cost
forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the
Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is
not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for a $0.7 billion increase in the base capital cost forecast in
2018 and has not sought rate recovery for the construction contingency costs. After considering the significant level of uncertainty
that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of
future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power
recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018 and $149 million ($111
million after tax) and $176 million ($131 million after tax) as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to
incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers
and related test results, and workforce statistics. The project continues to face challenges including, but not limited to, higher than
expected absenteeism; overall construction and subcontractor labor productivity; system turnover and testing activities; and
electrical equipment and commodity installation. In addition, Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of embedded schedule margin. With minimal schedule margin
remaining, the Unit 3 schedule is challenged, and any further extension of the hot functional testing or fuel load milestones, or other
delays from the challenges described below, could impact the ability to achieve the November 2021 in-service date.
As construction, including subcontract work, continues and testing and system turnover activities increase, challenges with
management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly
in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor,
and/or related cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, installation, system turnover, and the initial testing and
start-up, including any required engineering changes or any remediation related thereto, of plant systems, structures, or components
(some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear
industry at this scale), any of which may require additional labor and/or materials; or other issues could arise and change the
projected schedule and estimated cost. In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay
construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal
and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the
requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses,
including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. Findings resulting from such
inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests
have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters,
including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and
approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, may arise, which may result in additional license
amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including
inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in
increased costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any schedule extension beyond the regulatory-
approved in-service dates is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of approximately $25
million per month for Unit 3 and approximately $15 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC. While Georgia
Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine
whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through
regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.
Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of
any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and
Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia
Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and
valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data,
reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the
statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.
Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of
which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to
that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined
level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of
these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of
Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available
information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.
Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income
to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the
apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies
that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner
inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for
all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.
Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company
Gas)
AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of
future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the
timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future
removal activities.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule
and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations
related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as
obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term
assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these
assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is
indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these
retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the
ARO.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure
and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the
CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue
periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these
assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial
statements for additional information, including increases to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2020 by certain
Registrants.

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be
critical accounting estimates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and
Southern Company Gas)
The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of
assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan
assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement
benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan
assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are
accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in
future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.
Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the
discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of
determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company
discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of
market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The
discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the
projected benefit obligations.
The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical
experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents the average rate of earnings expected over the
long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments. Southern Company determines the amount of
the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the LRR of various asset classes to Southern
Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs component of net periodic benefit costs for the
following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.

Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)
The acquisition method of accounting requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at
their respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a
residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on
an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur,
including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a
planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level
below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management.
Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.
As part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is
more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative
goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and
circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial
performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative
assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its
carrying value.
Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020.
For its annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no
quantitative analysis was required. For its annual impairment tests for PowerSecure, Southern Company performed the quantitative
assessment, which resulted in the fair value of goodwill at PowerSecure exceeding its carrying value in all years presented.
However, Southern Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $34 million in 2019 as a result of its decision to sell
certain PowerSecure business units. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company" for additional information.
The continued COVID-19 pandemic and related responses continue to disrupt supply chains, reduce labor availability and
productivity, and reduce economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on Southern Company and its
subsidiaries, including the $263 million of goodwill recorded at PowerSecure. If the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes
significant to the operating results of PowerSecure and its businesses, a portion of the associated goodwill may become impaired.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as
well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are
determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset,
and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain
estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be
recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities" for additional information
regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.
Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)
Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to
specific regulatory disallowances. The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested
for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly
attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying
value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value
and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent
the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in
developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite
volatile in recent years.
Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities,
Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets, whether
in service or under construction. In addition, exclusive of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution
utilities, Southern Company's investments in long-lived assets also include investments in leveraged leases. During 2020, Southern
Company recorded impairment charges totaling $206 million ($105 million after tax) related to two of its leveraged lease
investments.
For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period
losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to
remarket generating capacity for an extended period, or the unplanned termination of a customer contract or the inability of a
customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include,
but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses
combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew
or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability
to deploy a development project. For Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases, impairment indicators include changes
in estimates of future rental payments to be received under the lease as well as the residual value of the leased asset at the end of the
lease.
As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves
management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an
impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Other Matters" and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on
certain assets recently evaluated for impairment, including Southern Company's leveraged lease investments.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)
Determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring
bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to
period depending upon accounting elections, changes in the applicable Registrant's assessment of the likelihood of future hedged
transactions, or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate
accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period
depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.
Derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recorded on the balance sheets as
either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. If the transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or
normal sale, it is exempt from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. The
applicable Registrant utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or
liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.
Changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If
the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in
the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are deferred in OCI on the balance sheets until the hedged transaction affects
earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, a company is required to formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well
as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.
Southern Company Gas uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to its results of operations due to the risk of
changes in the price of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, Southern Company Gas hedges against warmer-than-normal weather and
interest rates. The majority of these contracts are over-the-counter wholesale contracts for the purchase or sale of natural gas or
consist of contracts which do not include asset management agreements, financial optionality, or potential embedded derivatives.
The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated
amounts that Southern Company Gas would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into
account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For derivatives utilized at gas marketing services and wholesale
gas services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in results of
operations in the period of change. Gas marketing services records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI
and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.
Derivative assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the
valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value
of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:
•the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and
letters of credit);
•events specific to a given counterparty; and
•the impact of nonperformance risk on liabilities.
A significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions used in pricing derivative assets or liabilities may
result in a significant financial statement impact.
Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company and Southern Company Gas consider the
valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY –
"Market Price Risk" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements for more information.
Revenue Recognition (Southern Power)
Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-
derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. The
two categories with the most judgment required for Southern Power are described further below. Southern Power's revenues are
dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon
the inception of each contract.
Lease Transactions
Southern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or
contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in
exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine
II-54
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements        
COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, all of Southern Power's power sales contracts that
are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are
recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional
information.
Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative Transactions
If the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of
a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a
normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment,
including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating
capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.
Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts.
For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues
related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to
the financial statements for additional information.
Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)
Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power
will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, the
purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the
definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on
the relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may
engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions,
and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts,
discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for
potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional
information on recent acquisitions.
Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)
Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern
Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to
the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.
If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of
operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and
whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in
membership interests.
Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing
arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these
arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV
method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the
end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.
Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)
The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that
subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the
financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their

exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus,
the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the
Registrants.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Recently Adopted Accounting Standards" for additional information.
On March 12, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference
Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for
reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which is currently expected to begin phasing out on
December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging
relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance
provides the following optional expedients: (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii)
simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and
(iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by
reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31,
2022 by accounting topic.
The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. Contract language has been, or is expected
to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place
at the transition date. While existing effective hedging relationships are expected to continue, the Registrants will continue to
evaluate the provisions of ASU 2020–04 and the impacts of transitioning to an alternative rate. The ultimate outcome of the
transition cannot be determined at this time, but is not expected to have a material impact on the Registrants' financial statements.
See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Financing Activities" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements under
"Interest Rate Derivatives" herein for additional information.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Overview
The financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2020. The Registrants maintained adequate access to
capital throughout 2020, including through a period of volatility in the short-term financial markets during the first quarter 2020
primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a precautionary measure, in the first quarter 2020, Southern Company, Georgia
Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas increased their outstanding short-term debt and cash and cash equivalents
by entering into new bank term loans, entering into and funding new committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and funding
existing uncommitted credit facilities. During the second half of 2020, most of these additional borrowings were repaid. No
material changes occurred in the terms of the applicable Registrants' bank credit arrangements or their interest expense on short-
term debt as a result of these actions. The Registrants experienced no material counterparty credit losses during 2020 as a result of
the volatility in the financial markets during the first half of 2020.
The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well
as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include
distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating
companies include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, including to build new generation facilities, to
maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to
certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for
restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may include acquisitions or
new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's performance. Southern
Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand
requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply
with environmental regulations. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information.
Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2020, Southern Power utilized tax credits,
which provided $340 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2021 through 2023, each Registrant's
projected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities, as well as distributions to noncontrolling interests for Southern
Power, are expected to exceed its operating cash flows. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its
operating cash flows primarily by accessing borrowings from financial institutions and issuing debt and hybrid securities in the
capital markets. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern
Company. In addition, Georgia Power plans to utilize borrowings through the FFB and Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity
partnership contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and
for other working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their
bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "Sources of Capital" and "Financing Activities" herein for
additional information.
The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their
nuclear decommissioning trust funds increased in value at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. No
contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2020 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans
are anticipated during 2021. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Decommissioning" and "Pension Plans,"
respectively, for additional information.
At the end of 2020, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $61.43 per share (based on the closing price as
reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $26.48 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 232%, compared to
$63.70, $26.11, and 244%, respectively, at the end of 2019.
Cash Requirements
Capital Expenditures
Total estimated capital expenditures, including LTSA and nuclear fuel commitments, for the Registrants through 2025 based on
their current construction programs are as follows:

(b)Includes expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $0.4 billion for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
(c)Excludes approximately $0.5 billion per year for 2021 through 2025 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions and placeholder growth, which may vary
materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.
These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential
compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and
landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO
liabilities. Alabama Power's cost estimates are based on closure-in-place for all of its ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia
Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others.
These anticipated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are
refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2025 are provided in the table below. Material
expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power
and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the
financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and
Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals" herein.

Mississippi Power 28 23 23 20 14 
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in
environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating
plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to
meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected
environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials;
project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and
the cost of capital. The continued COVID-19 pandemic could also impair the ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as
discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities
and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" for additional information
regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and construction projects.
The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new
technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be
subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction
expenditures.
See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Construction Programs" herein for additional information.
Other Significant Cash Requirements
Long-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the
Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2020,
the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the
next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Fuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Commitments" for information on
Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and
purchased power commitments at December 31, 2020 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs
include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions
for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on
various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at
December 31, 2020. As discussed under "Capital Expenditures" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the
applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2021 through 2025. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2020
that extend beyond 2025 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for
various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the
financial statements.

Sources of Capital
Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings from financial institutions,
and debt and equity issuances in the capital markets. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's
stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. Southern Company does not expect to issue any equity in the capital markets
through 2025. See Note 8 to the financial statements under "Equity Units" for information on stock purchase contracts associated
with Southern Company's equity units.
The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the
past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and
equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Georgia Power plans to utilize borrowings from the FFB (as(*)

discussed further in Note 8 to the financial statements under "Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings") and Southern
Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein).
At certain periods during 2020, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities experienced a
reduction in operating cash flows as a result of the temporary suspension of disconnections for non-payment by customers resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related overall economic contraction. To date, this reduction of operating cash flows has not
had a material impact on the liquidity of any of the Registrants, and, during the third quarter 2020, most of the temporary measures
in place expired. The ultimate extent of the negative impact on the Registrants' liquidity depends on the duration of the COVID-19
pandemic and any federal, state, or local response and cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
information regarding suspended disconnections for non-payment by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural
gas distribution utilities.
The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2021, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment
opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals
(for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See "Cash Requirements" herein for additional information.
Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the
federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for
using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2020, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for
the Reading and Skookumchuck wind projects and received proceeds totaling $277 million. In addition, Southern Power received
tax equity funding totaling $16 million from existing partnerships. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under "General"
and "Southern Power," respectively, for additional information.
The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the
applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term
securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public
offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its
subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration
statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the
appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate
filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.
The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial
statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a
centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the
Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.
The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are
loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these
arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial
paper program.
Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas,
which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper
programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital
needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries
benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to
affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2020, the amount of subsidiary retained
earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.1 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash
obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently
anticipated cash obligations.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Certain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic
use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan
to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see "Financing
Activities" herein for information on financing activities that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2020. The following table

The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as
commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances,
the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.

Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b)Includes $1.245 billion and $500 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.
Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit
arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the
maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of the unused credit with banks is
allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper
programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric
operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2020 was approximately $1.4 billion (comprised of
approximately $854 million at Alabama Power, $550 million at Georgia Power, and $34 million at Mississippi Power). In addition,
at December 31, 2020, Georgia Power and Mississippi Power had approximately $174 million and $50 million, respectively, of
fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. See Note 8 to the financial

Southern Company
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $0.9 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a $1.1 billion
voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2019 and the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by the timing of
receivable collections and customer bill credits issued in 2020 by Alabama Power and Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial
statements under "Alabama Power" and "Georgia Power" and Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2020 and 2019 was primarily related to the Subsidiary Registrants' construction
programs, partially offset by proceeds from the sale transactions described in Note 15 to the financial statements, which totaled
$1.0 billion and $5.1 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 and 2019 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments and net
repayments of short-term bank debt and commercial paper, partially offset by net issuances of long-term debt and issuances of
common stock.
Alabama Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $37 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to approximately
$136 million in customer refunds, payments related to ARO settlements, timing of Rate CNP Compliance cost recovery, and
purchases of materials and supplies, partially offset by a $362 million voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2019.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Rate RSE" and " – Rate ECR" and Notes 6 and 11 to the financial
statements for additional information.

Company and net long-term debt issuances, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.
Georgia Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $123 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to approximately
$220 million in customer bill credits issued in 2020 associated with the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement and
2018 and 2019 earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range, lower retail revenues, and higher income tax payments, partially
offset by a $200 million voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2019, higher recovery of storm damage costs, and
the timing of vendor payments. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power" and Note 11 to the financial
statements for additional information.

partially offset by common stock dividend payments.
Mississippi Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $41 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the closeout of the
DOE contract related to the Kemper County energy facility, $13 million of storm damage costs primarily associated with Hurricane
Zeta, $11 million primarily related to decreased fuel cost recovery, and higher income tax payments, partially offset by a $54
million voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2019. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Mississippi

capital and common stock dividends paid to Southern Company, redemption of pollution control revenue bonds, and repayment of
short-term borrowings, partially offset by debt issuances and capital contributions from Southern Company. The net cash used for
financing activities in 2019 was primarily related to a return of capital to Southern Company and the redemption of senior notes,
partially offset by capital contributions from Southern Company and pollution control revenue bonds reoffered to the public.
Southern Power
Net cash provided from operating activities decreased $484 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a reduction in the
utilization of tax credits in 2020. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Income Tax Matters – Tax Credits" herein and Note

noncontrolling interests. The net cash used for financing activities in 2019 was primarily related to returns of capital and common
stock dividends paid to Southern Company, the repayment at maturity of senior notes, and distributions to noncontrolling interests,
partially offset by proceeds from net issuances of commercial paper.
Southern Company Gas
Net cash provided from operating activities increased $140 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a $145 million
voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2019, as well as the timing of vendor payments, energy marketing payables,
and income tax payments, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections and energy marketing receivables. The
timing of energy marketing payables and receivables was due to increased volumes of natural gas purchased and sold and higher
natural gas prices. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.
The net cash used for investing activities in 2020 was primarily related to construction of transportation and distribution assets
recovered through base rates and infrastructure investments recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution operations
and capital contributed to equity method investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of Jefferson Island and interests in
Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was primarily related to gross property
additions related to utility capital expenditures and infrastructure investments recovered through replacement programs at gas
distribution operations and capital contributed to equity method pipeline investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of

Credit Rating Risk
At December 31, 2020, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.
There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of
certain Registrants to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases
and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management,
and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2020 were as follows:

(*)Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require
credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade.
Southern Power had $105 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2020.
The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements
that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade.
Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating
downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they
do so.
Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, have agreements under which Mississippi Power continues to provide
retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through 2038. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in
the co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain
bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of
Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.
On August 27, 2020, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured long-term debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2 and revised
its rating outlook to stable from positive.
On September 25, 2020, Fitch upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured long-term debt rating to A- from BBB+ and revised
its rating outlook to stable from positive.
Also on September 25, 2020, Fitch revised the ratings outlook of Southern Company and its subsidiaries (excluding Georgia Power
and Mississippi Power) to stable from negative.
Market Price Risk
The Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019. See Note 14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well
as Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" for additional information.(*) (*)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the
natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric
operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the
guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in
natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its
wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling
agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has
been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating
capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of
contracts are priced at market.
Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to
economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a
variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap
agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses also actively manage storage
positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas
prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail
natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining operating margins. Some of these economic
hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.
The following table provides information related to variable interest rate exposure on long-term debt (including amounts due within
one year) at December 31, 2020 for the applicable Registrants:

The Registrants may enter into interest rate derivatives designated as hedges, which are intended to mitigate interest rate volatility
related to forecasted debt financings and existing fixed and floating rate obligations. See Note 14 to the financial statements under
"Interest Rate Derivatives" for additional information.
Southern Power had foreign currency denominated debt of €1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Southern Power has mitigated its
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps converting all interest and principal
payments to fixed-rate U.S. dollars. See Note 14 to the financial statements under "Foreign Currency Derivatives" for additional
information.(*)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019 are provided in the table below. The fair value of energy-related derivative contracts was not material
for the other Registrants. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and
certain of the natural gas distribution utilities' energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were
related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program.

(b)The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. Current period
changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.
The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas purchased (sold) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for
Southern Company and Southern Company Gas were as follows:

At December 31, 2019:
Commodity – Natural gas swaps 327 — 
Commodity – Natural gas options 262 218 
Total hedge volume 589 218 
Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a
contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern
Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 4.42 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 3.90 billion
mmBtu at December 31, 2020 and the net of long natural gas positions of 4.10 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of
3.88 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2019.
For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was equal to market prices at December
31, 2020 and was approximately $0.28 per mmBtu above market prices at December 31, 2019. The change in option fair value is
primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the
traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost
recovery clauses.(a) (a)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
The Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market
observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-
observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1, and contracts that include a combination of observable and unobservable
components, which are categorized as Level 3. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value
measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at

The Registrants are exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative
contracts, as applicable. The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have
investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit
exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under "Financial Instruments" and Note 14 to the financial statements.
Southern Company performs periodic reviews of its leveraged lease transactions, both domestic and international, and the
creditworthiness of the lessees, including a review of the value of the underlying leased assets and the credit ratings of the lessees.
Southern Company's domestic lease transactions generally do not have any credit enhancement mechanisms; however, the lessees
in its international lease transactions have pledged various deposits as additional security to secure the obligations. The lessees in
Southern Company's international lease transactions are also required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit
downgrade below a certain level. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under "Leveraged Leases" and "Other Matters –
Southern Company," respectively, for additional information, including recent impairment charges related to certain leveraged lease
investments.
Southern Company Gas Value at Risk (VaR)
VaR is the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given
degree of probability. Southern Company Gas' VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the
factors used to calculate VaR. Southern Company Gas' VaR is determined on a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding
period, which means that 95% of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal
to the amount of VaR calculated. The open exposure of Southern Company Gas is managed in accordance with established policies
that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management. Because Southern Company
Gas generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the(a)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
futures markets, Southern Company Gas' open exposure is generally mitigated. Southern Company Gas employs daily risk testing,
using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of its positions.
Southern Company Gas actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR and maintains a relatively small risk
exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval
and employing a one-day holding period, SouthStar's portfolio of positions for all periods presented was immaterial.
Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services segment had the following VaRs at December 31:
2020 2019 2018
(in millions)
Period end $ 1.3 $ 2.6 $ 6.4 
Average 2.5 3.4 3.7 
High 4.6 7.0 11.7 
Low 1.2 2.1 1.2 
(*)The VaR at December 31, 2018 reflects significant natural gas price increases in Sequent's key markets driven by an industry-wide lower-than-normal natural
gas storage inventory position and colder-than-normal weather in the middle of fourth quarter 2018. As weather and natural gas prices moderated subsequent to
December 31, 2018, VaR declined.
Credit Risk
Southern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed
to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.
Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which
consist of the 16 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the
non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of
natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit
security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light.
For 2020, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 21% of Southern Company
Gas' adjusted operating margin and 25% of adjusted operating margin for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations
segment.
Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted
from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to
Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of
credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas
reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each
Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and
report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.
Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage
capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the
interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.
Wholesale Gas Services
Southern Company Gas has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including
requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Southern Company Gas also
utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When more than one derivative
transaction with the same counterparty is outstanding and a legally enforceable netting agreement exists with that counterparty, the
"net" mark-to-market exposure represents a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk with that counterparty.
Netting agreements also enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and
against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from,
or owed to, counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables
and energy marketing payables.(*)

COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Collateral or credit
security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution but may also include
cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Southern Company Gas conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate
internal approvals for a counterparty's line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the
counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's and
BBB- from S&P. Generally, Southern Company Gas requires credit enhancements by way of a guaranty, cash deposit, or letter of
credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings.
Certain of Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could increase
the payments for collateral it posts in the normal course of business when its financial instruments are in net liability positions. At
December 31, 2020, for agreements with such features, Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments with liability fair values
were immaterial and Southern Company Gas had no collateral posted with derivatives counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.
Southern Company Gas has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. At
December 31, 2020, the top 20 counterparties of Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services segment represented
approximately 58%, or $234 million, of its total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of
A-, all of which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the
lower of the S&P or Moody's ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and
Moody's, respectively, and 1 being D / Default by S&P and Moody's, respectively. A counterparty that does not have an external
rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted
average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for
all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties' exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to a
S&P equivalent.

Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit
reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company
Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements
and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns
physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch
ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Southern Company and subsidiary companies (Southern
Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern
Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, Southern Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
Southern Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and an opinion on Southern Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to Southern Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility
subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 89% of Southern Company's consolidated operating revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and 85% of its consolidated total assets at December 31, 2020, are subject to rate regulation by their respective
state Public Service Commissions or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that the regulated utility subsidiaries meet
the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to
account for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate
regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and
equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits
related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance
expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and
approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility
service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an
impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by
rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of
return on invested capital. While Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through
regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or
(2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and
net book value of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory
orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of
incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to
customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the
Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting
process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of
audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates
that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the regulated utility subsidiaries, regulatory statutes,
interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the
likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of
similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded
regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
II-78
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Southern Company's regulated utility
subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that
might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Southern Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.
Disclosure of Uncertainties – Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction – Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment
in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact
of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission), actions by the co-owners
of the Vogtle project, and litigation or other legal proceedings involving the project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its
cost and schedule forecasts could impact its capacity to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject
to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery,
including challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and
related craft labor productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls
commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly,
installation, system turnover, and the initial testing and start-up, including any required engineering changes or any remediation
related thereto, of plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last
few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale), any of which may require additional labor and/or
materials; or other issues that could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. In addition, the continuing effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of
future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in future regulatory proceedings.
Management has recorded charges to income, including a total of $325 million in 2020, when it has determined that it is likely to
incur costs for which it will not seek recovery or which it has concluded are probable of disallowance for ratemaking purposes. In
addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1) the
status of construction; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners of
the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project. We
identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that
could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit matter
involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate regulation,
and difficult and subjective judgments.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the
ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the
construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and
monitoring of the construction schedule and to assess the disclosures of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of
its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors),
independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and
schedule challenges.
II-79
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
•We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of
construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties
impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the
construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential
risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
•We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction of
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs and to evaluate
the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any
potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
•We monitored the status of reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to the licensing
and commercial operation of the project.
•We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all
our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of
construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact
the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alabama Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Alabama Power as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Alabama Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Alabama Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Alabama Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Alabama Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Alabama Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Alabama Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred charges and credits related to income
taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues; operations and maintenance expenses; and
depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Alabama Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory
proceedings based on an analysis of Alabama Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its
investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of
return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is
premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Alabama Power
expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1)
II-87
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a
reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs and the net book value of retired
assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial
statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a
disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given
that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions,
auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its
inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates
that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Alabama Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Alabama Power and other interested parties
that may impact Alabama Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Alabama Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Georgia Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Georgia Power as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Georgia Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Georgia Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Georgia Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that

(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate

Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Georgia Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Georgia Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation

reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to

Disclosure of Uncertainties – Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction – Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power –
Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power Company's (Georgia Power) investment
in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact
of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission), actions by the co-owners
of the Vogtle project, and litigation or other legal proceedings involving the project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its
cost and schedule forecasts could impact its capacity to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject
to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery,
including challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and
related craft labor productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls
commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly,
installation, system turnover, and the initial testing and start-up, including any required engineering changes or any remediation
related thereto, of plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last
few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale), any of which may require additional labor and/or
materials; or other issues that could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. In addition, the continuing effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4. The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant
II-96
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission
decisions in future regulatory proceedings.
Management has recorded charges to income, including a total of $325 million in 2020, when it has determined that it is likely to
incur costs for which it will not seek recovery or which it cannot conclude are probable of recovery through the ratemaking process.
In addition, management has disclosed the status, risks, and uncertainties associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including (1)
the status of construction; (2) the status of regulatory proceedings; (3) the status of legal actions or issues involving the co-owners
of the project; and (4) other matters which could impact the ultimate recoverability of Georgia Power's investment in the project.
We identified as a critical audit matter the evaluation of Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties
that could impact the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This critical audit
matter involved significant audit effort requiring specialized industry and construction expertise, extensive knowledge of rate
regulation, and difficult and subjective judgments.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to Georgia Power's identification and disclosure of events and uncertainties that could impact the
ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the on-going evaluation, monitoring, and disclosure of matters related to the
construction and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We involved construction specialists to assist in our evaluation of Georgia Power's processes for on-going evaluation and
monitoring of the construction schedule and to assess the disclosures of the uncertainties impacting the ultimate cost recovery of
its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We attended meetings with Georgia Power and Southern Company officials, project managers (including contractors),
independent regulatory monitors, and co-owners of the project to evaluate and monitor construction status and identify cost and
schedule challenges.
•We read reports of external independent monitors employed by the Georgia Public Service Commission to monitor the status of
construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to evaluate the completeness of Georgia Power's disclosure of the uncertainties
impacting the ultimate cost recovery of its investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company officials and project managers regarding the status of construction, the
construction schedule, and cost forecasts to assess the financial statement disclosures with respect to project status and potential
risks and uncertainties to the achievement of such forecasts.
•We inspected regulatory filings and transcripts of Georgia Public Service Commission hearings regarding the construction of
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to identify potential challenges to the recovery of Georgia Power's construction costs and to evaluate
the disclosures with respect to such uncertainties.
•We inquired of Georgia Power and Southern Company management and internal and external legal counsel regarding any
potential legal actions or issues arising from project construction or issues involving the co-owners of the project.
•We monitored the status of reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to identify potential impediments to the licensing
and commercial operation of the project.
•We compared the financial statement disclosures relating to this matter to the information gathered through the conduct of all
our procedures to evaluate whether there were omissions relating to significant facts or uncertainties regarding the status of
construction or other factors which could impact the ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
•We obtained representation from management regarding disclosure of all matters related to the cost and/or status of the
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including matters related to a co-owner or regulatory development, that could impact
the recovery of the related costs.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Mississippi Power Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Mississippi Power as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Mississippi Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Mississippi Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Mississippi Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Mississippi Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Mississippi Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Mississippi Power) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Mississippi Power is subject to retail rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission and wholesale regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, the "Commissions"). Management has determined that it meets the
requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to utilize specialized rules to account
for the effects of rate regulation in the preparation of its financial statements. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to, property, plant, and equipment; other
regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; regulatory assets – asset retirement obligations; other cost of removal obligations;
deferred charges and credits related to income taxes; under and over recovered regulatory clause revenues; operating revenues;
operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and amortization.
The Commissions set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and approved in
regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of Mississippi Power's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of,
its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate
of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates
is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Mississippi
Power expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not
II-104
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business
and a reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs) and the high degree of
subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management
judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of
recently completed plant, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on
assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge
of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to
evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Mississippi Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations,
procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of
recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs
under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset
and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Mississippi Power and other interested parties
that may impact Mississippi Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a
future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Mississippi Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and subsidiary companies (Southern
Power) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Power as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Power's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
Southern Power's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Power in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Southern Power is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Power's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which is relates.
Income/Loss Allocation to Noncontrolling Interests – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Power has entered into a number of tax equity partnership arrangements, wherein they agree to sell 100% of a class of
membership interests (e.g. Class A) in an entity to a noncontrolling investor in exchange for cash contributions, while retaining
control of the entity through a separate class of membership interests (e.g. Class B). The agreements for these partnerships give
different rights and priorities to their owners in terms of cash distributions, tax attribute allocations, and partnership income or loss
allocations. These provisions make the conventional equity method of accounting where an investor applies its "percentage
ownership interest" to the investee's net income under generally accepted accounting principles to determine the investor's share of
earnings or losses difficult to apply. Therefore, Southern Power uses the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV)
accounting method to account for these partnership arrangements. The HLBV accounting method calculates each partner's share of
income or loss based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim at the end of the reporting period compared to the
beginning of the reporting period. The application of the HLBV accounting method by Southern Power required significant
consideration of the allocations between Southern Power and the noncontrolling investors over the life of the agreement and the
liquidation provisions of the agreement to determine the appropriate allocation of income or loss between the parties.
The determination of the appropriate amount of allocated partnership income or loss to noncontrolling interests using the HLBV
accounting method required increased audit effort and specialized skill and knowledge, including evaluation of the terms of the
agreement and consideration of the appropriateness of the HLBV model based on the provisions of the agreement.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures included the following, among others:
•For agreements that result in potentially material allocations of partnership income or loss, we read the agreements to
understand the liquidation provisions and the provisions governing the allocation of benefits.
•With the assistance of our income tax and HLBV modeling specialists, we evaluated the HLBV models utilized by
management to determine whether the models accurately reflect the allocation of income or loss and tax attributes in
accordance with the liquidation provisions and allocation terms defined in the agreements, as well as whether the inputs in the
models are accurate and complete.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Company Gas and subsidiary companies (Southern
Company Gas) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company Gas as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We did not audit the financial statements of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), Southern Company Gas' investment
which is accounted for by the use of the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Southern Company
Gas include its equity investment in SNG of $1,167 million and $1,137 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
respectively, and its earnings from its equity method investment in SNG of $129 million, $141 million, and $131 million for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose reports
(which express unqualified opinions on SNG's financial statements and contain an emphasis of matter paragraph calling attention to
SNG's significant transactions with related parties) have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for SNG, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Company Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on Southern Company Gas' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
Southern Company Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Southern Company Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Company Gas' internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters – Southern Company Gas) to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities (the "regulated utility subsidiaries"), which represent approximately 86%
of Southern Company Gas' consolidated revenues, are subject to rate regulation in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia by
their respective state Public Service Commission or other applicable state regulatory agencies (collectively, the "Commissions").
Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of regulation. Accounting for the
economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including, but not limited to,
II-120
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
property, plant, and equipment; other regulatory assets; other regulatory liabilities; other cost of removal obligations; deferred
charges and credits related to income taxes; operating revenues; other operations and maintenance expenses; and depreciation and
amortization.
The Commissions set the rates the regulated utility subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers. Rates are determined and
approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility
service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an
impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by
rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of
return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers
through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility
service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to
support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the
impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1)
recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under
construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the
outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate
regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management
estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of
costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates
that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial
recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of
regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in
Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by
intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction
in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the
external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other
interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict
management's assertions.
•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital
projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future
reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future
reduction in rates.
•We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and
regulatory developments.
Derivatives — Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 14 (Derivatives) to the financial
statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Southern Company Gas is exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally
foreign currency exchange rate risk and enters into contracts to manage the volatility attributable to these exposures. The majority
of these contracts are over-the-counter wholesale contracts for the purchase or sale of natural gas or consist of contracts which do
not include asset management agreements, financial optionality, or potential embedded derivatives. Typically, these physical and
financial contracts are not complex in structure and the valuation inputs are directly obtained from an observable source. However,
determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring
bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is complex and requires significant
II-121
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
judgment. In addition, the treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections,
changes in Southern Company Gas' assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions, or new interpretations of accounting
guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting each period. Accounting for derivatives
impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as assets and liabilities from risk management activities; other
deferred charges and assets; other deferred credits and liabilities; natural gas revenues; and cost of natural gas.
We identified the evaluation and monitoring of contracts with more complex terms as a critical audit matter and specifically,
whether these types of contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, contain an embedded derivative requiring
bifurcation, or qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Auditing these contracts is especially challenging due to the complexity of
the accounting requirements, requiring the specialized knowledge of such accounting.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
With the assistance of our energy transacting specialists, our audit procedures related to these contracts included the following,
among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over approval and assessment of contracts and contract amendments that
require additional levels of management review to assess deals on a frequent basis and to evaluate contracts meeting Southern
Company Gas' criteria by accounting and the appropriate level of management for proper classification between derivative or
accrual accounting.
•We tested, on a sample basis, contracts and contract amendments (derivative and non-derivative) with a focus on those with
more complex terms by independently evaluating the accounting treatment and comparing to the conclusions reached by
management.
•We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to derivatives for completeness and accuracy based on the results of
our audit procedures and the accounting requirements for such instruments.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, members' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial
statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Postretirement Benefit Obligation
At December 31, 2020, the Company's postretirement benefit obligation was $23 million and the Company's plan assets were $69
million, resulting in a net asset position of $46 million. As described in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the
postretirement benefit obligation is primarily based on actuarial calculations, which include various significant assumptions.
We identified the Company's estimate of the postretirement benefit obligation as a critical audit matter. Auditing the postretirement
benefit obligation required complex auditor judgment due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions used in the
calculation, which include the discount rate, the mortality rate, and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions had a
significant effect on the postretirement benefit obligation calculation.
II-123
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
•Comparing the actuarial assumptions used by management with historical trends and evaluating the change in the
postretirement benefit obligation from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, contributions, benefit
payments, and actuarial gains and losses.
•Evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity
and duration of the benefit payments.
•Evaluating the reasonableness of mortality rate by assessing whether the information was consistent with publicly
available information, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific factors were applied.
•Evaluating the expected return on plan assets by assessing whether management's assumptions were consistent with a
range of returns for a portfolio of comparative investments that was determined based on publicly available information.
Emphasis of Matter – Significant Transactions with Related Parties
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into significant transactions with related
parties.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General
Southern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern
Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated
utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. In January 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf
Power (another traditional electric operating company through December 31, 2018) to NextEra Energy. Southern Power develops,
constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy and battery energy storage projects,
and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural
gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas
(Tennessee). In 2018, Southern Company Gas sold its other natural gas utilities – Elizabethtown Gas (New Jersey), Florida City
Gas, and Elkton Gas (Maryland). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas
pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost,
specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications
for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics
services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary, primarily for Southern Company's
leveraged lease and other investments. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear
power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is
currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure
provides energy solutions to electric utilities and their customers in the areas of distributed generation, energy storage and
renewables, and energy efficiency. See Note 15 for information regarding disposition activities, including Southern Company's sale
of Gulf Power.
The Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant
influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary.
Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing
arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these
arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV
method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the
end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See "Variable Interest Entities" herein and Note 7 for additional
information.
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other
subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution
utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the
respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and
comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ
from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
At December 31, 2020 and/or 2019, Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas each had assets and
liabilities held for sale on their balance sheets. Unless otherwise noted, the disclosures herein related to specific asset and liability
balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019 exclude assets and liabilities held for sale. See Note 15 under "Assets Held for Sale" for
additional information including major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale by Southern Company, Southern
Power, and Southern Company Gas.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Effective January 1, 2019, the Registrants adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 required
lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changed the
recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provided clarification regarding the identification
of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. Lessor accounting was relatively unchanged and there was no
change to the accounting for existing leveraged leases. See Note 9 for additional information and related disclosures.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above transactions on a
monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the purchase or sale of electricity. See "Revenues –
Southern Power" herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas provide incidental services to and
receive such services from other Southern Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. Except as
described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas neither provided nor
received any material services to or from affiliates in any year presented.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to accounting requirements for the
effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent costs recovered that are expected to be
incurred in the future or probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process.
In the event that a portion of a traditional electric operating company's or a natural gas distribution utility's operations is no longer
subject to applicable accounting rules for rate regulation, such company would be required to write off to income or reclassify to
AOCI related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the
traditional electric operating company or the natural gas distribution utility would be required to determine if any impairment to
other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities
are to be reflected in rates. See Note 2 for additional information including details of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the
balance sheets for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas.
Revenues
The Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources which are accounted for under various revenue accounting guidance,
including revenue from contracts with customers, lease, derivative, and regulatory accounting. See Notes 4, 9, and 14 for additional
information.
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The majority of the revenues of the traditional electric operating companies are generated from contracts with retail electric
customers. These revenues, generated from the integrated service to deliver electricity when and if called upon by the customer, are
recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over time, at a tariff rate, and as electricity is delivered to the customer
during the month. Unbilled revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Retail rates may include
provisions to adjust revenues for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered from or returned to
customers, respectively, through adjustments to the billing factors. See Note 2 for additional information regarding regulatory
matters of the traditional electric operating companies.
Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms. Energy and other revenues are
generally recognized as services are provided. The contracts for capacity and energy in a wholesale PPA have multiple performance
obligations where the contract's total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling
price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services
transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, the traditional electric operating companies recognize revenue as the
performance obligations are satisfied over time as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is available to
the customer.
For both retail and wholesale revenues, the traditional electric operating companies have elected to recognize revenue for their sales
of electricity and capacity using the invoice practical expedient as they generally have a right to consideration in an amount that
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date and that may be invoiced. Payment for
goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of the Registrants' performance
obligation.
Southern Power
Southern Power sells capacity and energy at rates specified under contractual terms in long-term PPAs. These PPAs are accounted
for as operating leases, non-derivatives, or normal sale derivatives. Capacity revenues from PPAs classified as operating leases

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Energy revenues are recognized in the period the energy is
delivered.
Southern Power's non-lease contracts commonly include capacity and energy which are considered separate performance
obligations. In these contracts, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling
price. The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services
transferred with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Power recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are
satisfied over time, as electricity is delivered to the customer or as generation capacity is made available to the customer.
Southern Power generally has a right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the
performance completed to date and may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. Payment for
goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction of Southern Power's performance
obligation.
When multiple contracts exist with the same counterparty, the revenues from each contract are accounted for as separate
arrangements.
Southern Power may also enter into contracts to sell short-term capacity in the wholesale electricity markets. These sales are
generally classified as mark-to-market derivatives and net unrealized gains and losses on such contracts are recorded in wholesale
revenues. See Note 14 and "Financial Instruments" herein for additional information.
Southern Company Gas
Gas Distribution Operations
Southern Company Gas records revenues when goods or services are provided to customers. Those revenues are based on rates
approved by the state regulatory agencies of the natural gas distribution utilities. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated natural
gas market whereby Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle
customer billing functions. As required by the Georgia PSC, Atlanta Gas Light bills Marketers in equal monthly installments for
each residential, commercial, and industrial end-use customer's distribution costs as well as for capacity costs utilizing a seasonal
rate design for the calculation of each residential end-use customer's annual straight-fixed-variable charge, which reflects the
historic volumetric usage pattern for the entire residential class.
The majority of the revenues of Southern Company Gas are generated from contracts with natural gas distribution customers.
Revenues from this integrated service to deliver gas when and if called upon by the customer are recognized as a single
performance obligation satisfied over time and are recognized at a tariff rate as gas is delivered to the customer during the month.
The standalone selling price is primarily determined by the price charged to customers for the specific goods or services transferred
with the performance obligations. Generally, Southern Company Gas recognizes revenue as the performance obligations are
satisfied over time as natural gas is delivered to the customer. The performance obligations related to wholesale gas services are
satisfied, and revenue is recognized, at a point in time when natural gas is delivered to the customer.
Southern Company Gas has elected to recognize revenue for sales of gas using the invoice practical expedient as it generally has a
right to consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date
and that may be invoiced. Payment for goods and services rendered is typically due in the subsequent month following satisfaction
of Southern Company Gas' performance obligation.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities have rate structures that include volumetric rate
designs that allow the opportunity to recover certain costs based on gas usage. Revenues from sales and transportation services are
recognized in the same period in which the related volumes are delivered to customers. Revenues from residential and certain
commercial and industrial customers are recognized on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Additionally, unbilled revenues are
recognized for estimated deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers, from the last bill date to the end of the accounting
period. For other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries
through the end of the period.
The tariffs for several of the natural gas distribution utilities include provisions which allow for the recognition of certain revenues
prior to the time such revenues are billed to customers. These provisions are referred to as alternative revenue programs
II-136
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
and provide for the recognition of certain revenues prior to billing, as long as the amounts recognized will be collected from
customers within 24 months of recognition. These programs are as follows:
•Weather normalization adjustments – reduce customer bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increase
customer bills when weather is warmer than normal and are included in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas, Chattanooga
Gas, and, prior to its sale, Elizabethtown Gas;
•Revenue normalization mechanisms – mitigate the impact of conservation and declining customer usage and are contained
in the tariffs for Virginia Natural Gas, Chattanooga Gas, Nicor Gas (effective November 1, 2019), and, prior to its sale,
Elkton Gas; and
•Revenue true-up adjustment – included within the provisions of the GRAM program in which Atlanta Gas Light
participates as a short-term alternative to formal rate case filings, the revenue true-up feature provides for a positive (or
negative) adjustment to record revenue in the amount of any variance to budgeted revenues, which are submitted and
approved annually as a requirement of GRAM. Such adjustments are reflected in customer billings in a subsequent
program year.
Wholesale Gas Services
Southern Company Gas nets revenues from energy and risk management activities with the associated costs. Profits from sales
between segments are eliminated and are recognized as goods or services sold to end-use customers. Southern Company Gas
records transactions that qualify as derivatives at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of
change and characterized as unrealized gains or losses. Gains and losses on derivatives held for energy trading purposes are
presented on a net basis in revenue.
Gas Marketing Services
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues from natural gas sales and transportation services in the same period in which the
related volumes are delivered to customers and recognizes sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial
customers on the basis of scheduled meter readings. Southern Company Gas also recognizes unbilled revenues for estimated
deliveries of gas not yet billed to these customers from the most recent meter reading date to the end of the accounting period. For
other commercial and industrial customers and for all wholesale customers, revenues are based on actual deliveries during the
period.
Southern Company Gas recognizes revenues on 12-month utility-bill management contracts as the lesser of cumulative earned or
cumulative billed amounts.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services business has a concentration of credit risk for services it provides to its
counterparties. This credit risk is generally concentrated in 20 of its counterparties and is measured by 30-day receivable exposure
plus forward exposure. Counterparty credit risk is evaluated using a S&P equivalent credit rating, which is determined by a process
of converting the lower of the S&P or Moody's rating to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa
by S&P and Moody's, respectively, and 1 being equivalent to D/Default by S&P and Moody's, respectively. A counterparty that
does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of its financial ratios. As of December 31, 2020,
the top 20 counterparties represented 58%, or $234 million, of the total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P
equivalent rating of A-.
Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which
consist of 16 Marketers in Georgia (including SouthStar). The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the
lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for
the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of
natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to
obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from
Atlanta Gas Light.
Concentration of Revenue
Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power (with the exception of its full requirements cost-based
MRA electric tariffs described below), and Southern Company Gas each have a diversified base of customers and no single
customer or industry comprises 10% or more of each company's revenues.
II-137
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality
located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based MRA electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the
FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2020
and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and
any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Significant portions of Southern Power's revenues have been derived from certain customers pursuant to PPAs. The following table
shows the percentage of total revenues for Southern Power's top three customers for each of the years presented:
2020 2019 2018
Southern California Edison 9.4 % 6.8 % 6.2 %
Georgia Power 8.0 % 9.0 % 9.8 %
Duke Energy Corporation 6.7 % N/A 6.8 %
Morgan Stanley Capital Group N/A 4.9 % N/A
Fuel Costs
Fuel costs for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense
generally includes fuel transportation costs and the cost of purchased emissions allowances as they are used. For Alabama Power
and Georgia Power, fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel. For the traditional electric operating
companies, fuel costs also include gains and/or losses from fuel-hedging programs as approved by their respective state PSCs.
Cost of Natural Gas
Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, Southern Company Gas charges its utility
customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies.
Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to
regulatory review. Southern Company Gas defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of
commodity revenue earned in a given period such that no operating income is recognized related to these costs. The deferred or
accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred and
accrued natural gas costs are included in the balance sheets as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, respectively.
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services' customers are charged for actual or estimated natural gas consumed. Within cost of
natural gas, Southern Company Gas also includes costs of lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of
inventories to market value, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.
Income Taxes
The Registrants use the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all
significant income tax temporary differences. In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional
electric operating companies are deferred and amortized over the average life of the related property, with such amortization
normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation and amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural
gas distribution utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are deferred and amortized to income
tax expense over the life of the respective asset.
Under current tax law, certain projects at Southern Power related to the construction of renewable facilities are eligible for federal
ITCs. Southern Power estimates eligible costs which, as they relate to acquisitions, may not be finalized until the allocation of the
purchase price to assets has been finalized. Southern Power applies the deferred method to ITCs, whereby the ITCs are recorded as
a deferred credit and amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset. Furthermore, the tax basis of the asset is
reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit
of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. State
ITCs are recognized as an income tax benefit in the period in which the credits are generated. In addition, certain projects are
eligible for federal and state PTCs, which are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production.
Federal ITCs and PTCs, as well as state ITCs and other state tax credits available to reduce income taxes payable, were not fully
utilized in 2020 and will be carried forward and utilized in future years. In addition, Southern Company is expected to have various
state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for certain of its subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power and Southern Power, which
would result in income tax benefits in the future, if utilized. See Note 10 under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes – Tax Credit
Carryforwards" and " – Net Operating Loss Carryforwards" for additional information.

The Registrants recognize tax positions that are "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination by the appropriate
taxing authorities. See Note 10 under "Unrecognized Tax Benefits" for additional information.
Other Taxes
Taxes imposed on and collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies are presented net on the Registrants'
statements of income and are excluded from the transaction price in determining the revenue related to contracts with a customer.
Southern Company Gas is taxed on its gas revenues by various governmental authorities, but is allowed to recover these taxes from
its customers. Revenue taxes imposed on the natural gas distribution utilities are recorded at the amount charged to customers,
which may include a small administrative fee, as operating revenues, and the related taxes imposed on Southern Company Gas are
recorded as operating expenses on the statements of income. Revenue taxes included in operating expenses were $104 million,
$114 million, and $111 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities record AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not
realized currently, AFUDC increases the revenue requirement and is recovered over the service life of the asset through a higher
rate base and higher depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not taxable.
Interest related to financing the construction of new facilities at Southern Power and new facilities not included in the traditional
electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' regulated rates is capitalized in accordance with standard interest
capitalization requirements.
Total AFUDC and interest capitalized for the Registrants in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was as follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Registrants evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment
has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance, a sales transaction price that is less than the asset group's
carrying value, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group, as compared with the carrying value
of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by either the amount of
regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the(*)

fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in
order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when
circumstances or events change. See Note 3 under "Other Matters – Southern Company" and " – Southern Company Gas" and Note
15 under "Southern Company," "Southern Power," and "Southern Company Gas – Sale of Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast
Pipeline" for information regarding impairment charges recorded during the periods presented.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities
Southern Power's intangible assets consist primarily of certain PPAs acquired, which are amortized over the term of the respective
PPA. Southern Company Gas' goodwill and other intangible assets and liabilities primarily relate to its 2016 acquisition by
Southern Company. In addition to these items, Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets also relate to its 2016
acquisition of PowerSecure.
Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise, as discussed below. Southern Company and Southern Company Gas each evaluated its goodwill in the
fourth quarter 2020 and determined no impairment was required. If the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related responses,
including supply chain disruptions, reduced labor availability and/or productivity, and reduced economic activity, become
significant to the operating results of PowerSecure and its businesses, a portion of its $263 million of goodwill may become
impaired. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
A goodwill impairment charge of $32 million was recorded in the second quarter 2019 in contemplation of the July 2019 sale of
PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business. In the third quarter 2019, impairment charges of $2 million and $3 million
were recorded to goodwill and other intangible assets, net, respectively, in contemplation of the December 2019 sale of
PowerSecure's lighting business. See Note 15 under "Southern Company" for additional information.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill was as follows:

Intangible liabilities of $91 million recorded under acquisition accounting for transportation contracts at Southern Company Gas
were fully amortized as of December 31, 2019.
Acquisition Accounting
At the time of an acquisition, management will assess whether acquired assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For
acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, operating results from the date of acquisition are included in the acquiring
entity's financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition
of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the
relative fair value of assets acquired.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and management may engage
independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and
typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts,
discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred for potential or
successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.
Historically, contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once an acquired construction project is
placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, management fair values the arrangement with any changes
recorded in the statements of income. See Note 13 for additional fair value information.
Development Costs
For Southern Power, development costs are capitalized once a project is probable of completion, primarily based on a review of its
economics and operational feasibility, as well as the status of power off-take agreements and regulatory approvals, if applicable.
Southern Power's capitalized development costs are included in CWIP on the balance sheets. All of Southern Power's development
costs incurred prior to the determination that a project is probable of completion are expensed as incurred and included in other
operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income. If it is determined that a project is no longer probable of
completion, any of Southern Power's capitalized development costs are expensed and included in other operations and maintenance
expense in the statements of income.
Long-Term Service Agreements
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance
support for certain of their generating facilities. The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment,(a)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
which generally includes the cost of all labor and materials. The LTSAs also obligate the counterparties to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in each contract.
Payments made under the LTSAs for the performance of any planned inspections or unplanned capital maintenance are recorded in
the statements of cash flows as investing activities. Receipts of major parts into materials and supplies inventory prior to planned
inspections are treated as noncash transactions in the statements of cash flows. Any payments made prior to the work being
performed are recorded as prepayments in other current assets and noncurrent assets on the balance sheets. At the time work is
performed, an appropriate amount is accrued for future payments or transferred from the prepayment and recorded as property,
plant, and equipment or expensed.
Transmission Receivables/Prepayments
As a result of Southern Power's acquisition and construction of generating facilities, Southern Power has transmission receivables
and/or prepayments representing the portion of interconnection network and transmission upgrades that will be reimbursed to
Southern Power. Upon completion of the related project, transmission costs are generally reimbursed by the interconnection
provider within a five-year period and the receivable/prepayments are reduced as payments or services are received.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments
are securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Southern Company Gas had $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of restricted cash held as
collateral for workers' compensation, life insurance, and long-term disability insurance, which is included in cash, cash equivalents,
and restricted cash on the statements of cash flows.
Storm Damage Reserves
Each traditional electric operating company maintains a reserve to cover or is allowed to defer and recover the cost of damages
from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and, for Mississippi Power, the cost of uninsured damages to its
generation facilities and other property. Alabama Power also has authority from the Alabama PSC to accrue certain additional
amounts as circumstances warrant. Alabama Power recorded additional accruals of $100 million and $84 million in 2020 and 2019,
respectively. In accordance with their respective state PSC orders, the traditional electric operating companies accrued the
following amounts related to storm damage recovery in 2020, 2019, and 2018:

Leveraged Leases
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, a subsidiary of Southern Holdings had four leveraged lease agreements, with original terms
ranging up to 45 years, which relate to energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets, including two international
projects. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-
term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These
assumptions include the effective tax rate, the residual value, the credit quality of the lessees, and the timing of expected tax cash
flows. See Notes 3 and 15 under "Other Matters – Southern Company" and "Southern Company," respectively, for additional
information on the leveraged lease investments, including impairment charges and completed and planned sales.(a)(b) (b)

Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies for the traditional electric operating companies generally includes the average cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials and supplies for Southern Company Gas generally includes propane gas
inventory, fleet fuel, and other materials and supplies. Materials and supplies for Southern Power generally includes the average
cost of generating plant materials.
Materials are recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as
appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed. In addition, certain major parts are recorded as inventory when acquired and
then capitalized at cost when installed to property, plant, and equipment.
Fuel Inventory
Fuel inventory for the traditional electric operating companies includes the average cost of coal, natural gas, oil, transportation, and
emissions allowances. Fuel inventory for Southern Power, which is included in other current assets, includes the average cost of oil,
natural gas, and emissions allowances. Fuel is recorded to inventory when purchased and then expensed, at weighted average cost,
as used. Emissions allowances granted by the EPA are included in inventory at zero cost. The traditional electric operating
companies recover fuel expense through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC or, for wholesale rates, the FERC.
Natural Gas for Sale
With the exception of Nicor Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities record natural gas inventories on a WACOG basis. In
Georgia's deregulated, competitive environment, Marketers sell natural gas to firm end-use customers at market-based prices. On a
monthly basis, Atlanta Gas Light assigns to Marketers the majority of the pipeline storage services that it has under contract, along
with a corresponding amount of inventory. Atlanta Gas Light retains and manages a portion of its pipeline storage assets and related
natural gas inventories for system balancing and to serve system demand.
Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored
prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not
restored prior to year end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the inventory layers liquidated. The cost of
natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for
differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's or
Southern Company Gas' net income. At December 31, 2020, the Nicor Gas LIFO inventory balance was $178 million. Based on the
average cost of gas purchased in December 2020, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas' inventory at December 31, 2020
was $259 million.(*)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and all other segments record inventory at LOCOM, with
cost determined on a WACOG basis. For these segments, Southern Company Gas evaluates the weighted average cost of its natural
gas inventories against market prices to determine whether any declines in market prices below the WACOG are other than
temporary. For any declines considered to be other than temporary, Southern Company Gas records LOCOM adjustments to cost of
natural gas to reduce the value of its natural gas inventories to market value. LOCOM adjustments for wholesale gas services were
$1 million, $21 million, and $10 million during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Energy Marketing Receivables and Payables
Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services provides services to retail gas marketers, wholesale gas marketers, utility
companies, and industrial customers. These counterparties utilize netting agreements that enable wholesale gas services to net
receivables and payables by counterparty upon settlement. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services also nets across product
lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts
due from, or owed to, wholesale gas services' counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis in the balance sheets
as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables.
Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services has trade and credit contracts that contain minimum credit rating requirements.
These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if Southern Company Gas'
credit ratings are downgraded to non-investment grade status. Under such circumstances, Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas
services would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. As of December 31, 2020
and 2019, the required collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade was $5 million and $11 million, respectively.
Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of
counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral.
Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but
may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. When more than one derivative transaction with the same
counterparty is outstanding and a legally enforceable netting agreement exists with that counterparty, the "net" mark-to-market
exposure represents a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk with that counterparty. Southern Company Gas'
wholesale gas services also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant
transactions.
See "Concentration of Credit Risk" herein for additional information.
Provision for Uncollectible Accounts
The customers of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are billed monthly. For the
majority of receivables, a provision for uncollectible accounts is established based on historical collection experience and other
factors. For the remaining receivables, if the company is aware of a specific customer's inability to pay, a provision for
uncollectible accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. If
circumstances change, the estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could change as well. Circumstances that could
affect this estimate include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, customer deposits, and general economic conditions.
Customers' accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts
averaged less than 1% of revenues for each Registrant.
Credit risk exposure at Nicor Gas is mitigated by a bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission. The bad debt rider provides
for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas' actual bad debt experience on an annual basis
and the benchmark bad debt expense used to establish its base rates for the respective year.
See Note 2 for information regarding recovery of incremental bad debt expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic at certain of the
traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities.
Financial Instruments
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, electricity purchases and sales, and occasionally foreign currency
exchange rates. Southern Company Gas uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices,
weather, interest rates, and commodity prices. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheets (included in "Other" or shown separately as "Risk Management Activities") and are measured at fair value. See Note
13 for additional information regarding fair value. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern
Power's bulk energy purchases and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are excluded from fair value accounting
requirements because they qualify for the "normal" scope exception, and are accounted for under the
II-145
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements

accrual method. Derivative contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the
traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs result in the deferral of
related gains and losses in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur. Other
derivative contracts that qualify as fair value hedges are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net
basis in the statements of income. Cash flows from derivatives are classified on the statements of cash flows in the same category
as the hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information regarding derivatives.
The Registrants offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under
netting arrangements. The Registrants had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising
from derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2020.
The Registrants are exposed to potential losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The
Registrants have established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties
in order to mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of natural gas revenues in the event of
warmer-than-normal weather in the Heating Season. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in
natural gas revenues. Non-exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic
value for non-exchange-traded contracts are also reflected in natural gas revenues in the statements of income.
Wholesale gas services purchases natural gas for storage when the current market price paid to buy and transport natural gas plus
the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than the market price that can be received in the future, resulting in positive net
natural gas revenues. NYMEX futures and OTC contracts are used to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially protect the
natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the stored natural gas is sold. Southern Company Gas enters into
transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve its customers and various markets. NYMEX
futures and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity in order
to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between
delivery points occurs. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are carried at fair value on the balance
sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in natural gas revenues on the statements of income in the period of change. These
contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
The purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted average cost or accrual basis, as
appropriate, rather than on the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with
the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation
capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements, and these demand charges and payments are recognized on
the statements of income in the period they are incurred. This difference in accounting methods can result in volatility in reported
earnings, even though the economic margin is substantially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.
Comprehensive Income
The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result
from transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of
net income attributable to the Registrant, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges, and reclassifications for amounts
included in net income. Comprehensive income also consists of certain changes in pension and other postretirement benefit plans
for Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas.

The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required
to consolidate the VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE. See Note 7 for additional information regarding VIEs.
Alabama Power has established a wholly-owned trust to issue preferred securities. See Note 8 under "Long-term Debt" for
additional information. However, Alabama Power is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore, the investment
in the trust is reflected as other investments, and the related loan from the trust is reflected as long-term debt in Alabama Power's
balance sheets.(*)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity
On August 14, 2020, the Alabama PSC issued its order regarding Alabama Power's September 2019 petition for a CCN, which
authorized Alabama Power to (i) construct an approximately 720-MW combined cycle facility at Alabama Power's Plant Barry
(Plant Barry Unit 8) that is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2023, (ii) complete the acquisition of the Central Alabama
Generating Station, which occurred on August 31, 2020, (iii) purchase approximately 240 MWs of combined cycle generation
under a long-term PPA, which began on September 1, 2020, and (iv) pursue up to approximately 200 MWs of cost-effective
demand-side management and distributed energy resource programs. Alabama Power's petition for a CCN was predicated on the
results of Alabama Power's 2019 IRP provided to the Alabama PSC, which identified an approximately 2,400-MW resource need
for Alabama Power, driven by the need for additional winter reserve capacity. See Note 15 under "Alabama Power" for additional
information on the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station.
The Alabama PSC authorized the recovery of actual costs for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 up to 5% above the estimated
in-service cost of $652 million. In so doing, it recognized the potential for developments that could cause the project costs to
exceed the capped amount, in which case Alabama Power would provide documentation to the Alabama PSC to explain and justify
potential recovery of the additional costs. At December 31, 2020, project expenditures associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 included
in CWIP totaled approximately $66 million.
The Alabama PSC further directed that the proposed solar generation of approximately 400 MWs, coupled with battery energy
storage systems (solar/battery systems), be evaluated under an existing Renewable Generation Certificate (RGC) issued by the
Alabama PSC in September 2015. The contracts proposed in the CCN petition expired on July 31, 2020. Any future requests for
solar/battery systems will be evaluated under the RGC process.
Energy Alabama, Gasp, Inc., and the Sierra Club filed requests for reconsideration and rehearing with the Alabama PSC, and, on
December 10, 2020, the Alabama PSC issued an order denying the requests. On January 7, 2021, Energy Alabama and Gasp, Inc.
filed judicial appeals regarding both the Alabama PSC's August 14, 2020 CCN order and the December 10, 2020 order denying
reconsideration and rehearing.
Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 pursuant to its Rate CNP New Plant. Alabama Power is
recovering all costs associated with the Central Alabama Generating Station through the inclusion in Rate RSE of revenues from
the existing power sales agreement and, on expiration of that agreement, expects to recover costs pursuant to Rate CNP New Plant.
The recovery of costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry are expected to be
recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. Alabama Power expects to recover the capacity-related costs associated with the PPAs
through its Rate CNP PPA. In addition, fuel and energy-related costs are expected to be recovered through Rate ECR. Any
remaining costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 and the acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station are expected to
be recovered through Rate RSE.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Rate RSE
The Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected
weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking
information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together,
cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is
an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting
point if Alabama Power (i) has an "A" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top
one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey. As initially designed, if Alabama Power's actual retail return was
above the allowed WCER range, the excess would be refunded to customers unless otherwise directed by the Alabama PSC;
however, there was no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range.
In 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to
address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under
Rate RSE in the near term. Alabama Power continues to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding
reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of
approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 51.6%
and 50.3%, respectively.
The approved modifications to Rate RSE began for billings in January 2019. The modifications include reducing the top of the
allowed WCER range from 6.21% to 6.15% and modifications to the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results that
II-151
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
allow Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range.
Generally, during a year without a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%,
customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of
the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%. During a year
with a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER exceeds 6.15%, customers receive 50% of the amount
between 6.15% and 6.90% and all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 6.90%. There is no provision for additional customer
billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range.
In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, in 2018, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward
adjustments under Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and to return $50 million to customers through bill credits in 2019. Retail rates
under Rate RSE remained unchanged for 2019 and 2020.
Together with Rate RSE, Alabama Power has an established retail tariff that provides for an adjustment to customer billings to
recognize the impact of a change in the statutory income tax rate. In accordance with this tariff, Alabama Power returned $267
million to retail customers through bill credits during 2018 as a result of the change in the federal income tax rate under the Tax
Reform Legislation.
At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's retail return exceeded the allowed WCER range, which resulted in Alabama Power
establishing a regulatory liability of $109 million for Rate RSE refunds. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued in
February 2019, Alabama Power applied $78 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $31
million was refunded to customers through bill credits starting in July 2019. At December 31, 2019 and 2020, Alabama Power's
WCER exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $53 million and $50 million,
respectively, for Rate RSE refunds. In April 2020, the regulatory liability at December 31, 2019 was refunded to customers through
bill credits. The $50 million regulatory liability at December 31, 2020 will be refunded to customers through bill credits in April
2021.
During 2019, Alabama Power provided to the Alabama PSC and the Alabama Office of the Attorney General information related to
the operation and utilization of Rate RSE, in accordance with the rules governing the operation of Rate RSE. During 2020, the
Alabama PSC concluded that Rate RSE continues to fulfill its intended purposes and that no significant revisions are needed or
warranted.
On December 1, 2020, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for
calendar year 2021, resulting in an increase of 4.09%, or approximately $228 million annually, that became effective for the billing
month of January 2021.
Rate CNP New Plant
Rate CNP New Plant allows for recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with newly developed or acquired certificated
generating facilities placed into retail service. No adjustments to Rate CNP New Plant occurred during the period 2018 through
2020. See "Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity" herein for additional information.
Rate CNP PPA
Rate CNP PPA allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with certificated PPAs. Revenues for Rate CNP
PPA, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama
Power's revenues or net income but will affect annual cash flow. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2018
through 2020 and no adjustment is expected for 2021. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Alabama Power had an under recovered
Rate CNP PPA balance of $58 million and $40 million, respectively, which is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the
balance sheet.
Rate CNP Compliance
Rate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such
mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar
considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information
and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama PSC by December
1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance
expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial
statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
II-152
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or
net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and
depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.
In November 2018, 2019, and 2020, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with
governmental mandates for the following calendar year, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The 2018 filing reflected a
projected under recovered retail revenue requirement of approximately $205 million, which was recovered in the billing months of
January 2019 through December 2019. The 2019 filing reflected a projected over recovered retail revenue requirement, which
resulted in a rate decrease of approximately $68 million that became effective for the billing month of January 2020. The 2020
filing reflected a projected under recovered retail revenue requirement of approximately $59 million.
On December 1, 2020, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order that Alabama Power leave the 2020 Rate CNP Compliance factor
in effect for 2021, with any prior year under collected amount deemed recovered before any current year amounts are recovered.
Any remaining under recovered amount will be reflected in the 2021 filing.
At December 31, 2020, Alabama Power had an over recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $28 million included in other
regulatory liabilities, current on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, Alabama Power had an over recovered Rate CNP
Compliance balance of $62 million, of which $55 million is included in other regulatory liabilities, current and $7 million is
included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.
Rate ECR
Rate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under
recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in
actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts
billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the
Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is
required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but
will impact operating cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.
In May 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR from 2.015 cents per KWH to 2.353 cents per KWH effective
July 2018 through December 2018. In December 2018, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to leave this rate in effect through
December 31, 2019.
As discussed herein under "Rate RSE," in accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued in February 2019, Alabama Power
utilized $78 million of the 2018 Rate RSE refund liability to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance.
In December 2019, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 2.353 cents per KWH to 2.160 cents per KWH, equal
to 1.82%, or approximately $102 million annually, that became effective for the billing month of January 2020.
In October 2020, Alabama Power reduced its over-collected fuel balance by $94.3 million in accordance with an August 7, 2020
Alabama PSC order authorizing Alabama Power to reduce its over-collected fuel balance by $100 million and return that amount to
customers in the form of bill credits, with any undistributed amount remaining in the regulatory liability for the benefit of
customers.
On December 1, 2020, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 2.160 cents per KWH to 1.960 cents per KWH,
equal to 1.84%, or approximately $103 million annually, that became effective for the billing month of January 2021. The rate will
adjust to 5.910 cents per KWH in January 2022 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC.
At December 31, 2020, Alabama Power's over recovered fuel costs totaled $18 million and is included in other regulatory
liabilities, current on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, Alabama Power's over recovered fuel costs totaled $49 million, of
which $32 million is included in other regulatory liabilities, current and $17 million is included in other regulatory liabilities,
deferred on the balance sheet. These classifications are based on estimates, which include such factors as weather, generation
availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these factors could have a significant impact on the timing
of any recovery or return of fuel costs.
Tax Reform Accounting Order
In 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorized Alabama Power to defer the benefits of federal excess
deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Reform Legislation for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a regulatory liability
and to use up to $30 million of such deferrals to offset under recovered amounts under Rate ECR. The final excess deferred tax
liability for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $69 million, of which $30 million was used to offset the

Rate ECR under recovered balance. In December 2019, the Alabama PSC issued an order authorizing Alabama Power to apply the
remaining deferred balance of approximately $39 million to increase the balance in the NDR. See "Rate NDR" herein and Note 10
under "Current and Deferred Income Taxes" for additional information.
Software Accounting Order
In February 2019, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for
operations and maintenance costs associated with software implementation projects. The regulatory asset will be amortized ratably
over the life of the related software. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the regulatory asset balance totaled $17 million and
$6 million, respectively, and is included in other deferred charges and assets on the balance sheet.
Plant Greene County
Alabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership
Agreements" for additional information. In December 2019, Mississippi Power updated its proposed RMP, originally filed in 2018
with the Mississippi PSC. The RMP proposed a four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to
the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively. On December 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order
concluding the RMP docket and requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated
retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation, which could include Plant Greene County, by year-end 2027 to reduce
Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin. Mississippi Power's IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2021.
Any proposed Plant Greene County unit retirements by Mississippi Power would require the completion of transmission and
system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will continue to monitor the status of
Mississippi Power's IRP and associated regulatory processes, as well as the transmission and system reliability improvements.
Alabama Power will review all the facts and circumstances and will evaluate all of its alternatives prior to reaching a final
determination on the ongoing operations of Plant Greene County. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this
time.
Rate NDR
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover
the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate
NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve
balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below $50 million, a reserve
establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve
balance reaches $75 million.
The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and
maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a 24-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority
to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent further Alabama
PSC approval, the maximum total Rate NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month per non-residential customer
account and $5 per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama
PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. The order allows for reliability-related expenditures to be
charged against the additional accruals when the NDR balance exceeds $75 million. Alabama Power may designate a portion of the
NDR to reliability-related expenditures as a part of an annual budget process for the following year or during the current year for
identified unbudgeted reliability-related expenditures that are incurred. Accruals that have not been designated can be used to offset
storm charges. Additional accruals to the NDR enhance Alabama Power's ability to mitigate the financial effects of future natural
disasters, promote system reliability, and offset costs retail customers would otherwise bear. Alabama Power made additional
accruals of $100 million and $84 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no such accruals in 2018.
As discussed herein under "Tax Reform Accounting Order," in accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued in December 2019,
Alabama Power also applied the remaining excess deferred income tax regulatory liability balance of approximately $39 million to
increase the balance in the NDR, resulting in an accumulated balance of $150 million at December 31, 2019. Of this amount,
Alabama Power designated $37 million to be applied to budgeted reliability-related expenditures for 2020, which was included in
other regulatory liabilities, current and was utilized in 2020. The remaining NDR balance of $113 million was included in other
regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.
Alabama Power collected approximately $16 million annually in 2018 and 2019 through the reserve establishment charge.
Effective with March 2020 billings, the reserve establishment charge was suspended and the reserve maintenance charge was

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
activated as a result of the NDR balance exceeding $75 million. Alabama Power collected approximately $5 million in 2020 and
expects to collect $3 million annually beginning in 2021 unless the NDR balance falls below $50 million. During 2020, Alabama
Power recorded $51 million and $67 million against the NDR for damages incurred to its transmission and distribution facilities
from Hurricane Sally and Hurricane Zeta, respectively. The remaining balance of $77 million is included in other regulatory
liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.
As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR
will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash
flows.
Environmental Accounting Order
Based on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is authorized to establish a
regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered
costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The
regulatory asset is amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision
regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance.
Georgia Power
Georgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of
the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2019 ARP, which
includes traditional base tariffs, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, the Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR)
tariff, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3
and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a fuel cost recovery tariff, both under
separate regulatory proceedings.
As approved by the Georgia PSC in the seventeenth VCM proceeding, prior to the expected in-service date of Plant Vogtle Unit 3,
Georgia Power expects to file a request to adjust retail base rates to include the portion of costs related to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and
common facilities that were deemed prudent in a previous stipulated agreement. As costs are included in retail base rates, the
related financing costs will no longer be recovered through the NCCR tariff. See "Nuclear Construction" herein for additional
information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Rate Plans
2019 ARP
In December 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2019 ARP, under which Georgia Power increased its rates on January 1,
2020. On December 15, 2020, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective January 1, 2021. Details of tariff adjustments
are provided in the table below:
Tariff 2020 2021
(in millions)
Traditional base $ — $ 120 
ECCR 318 2 
DSM 12 (15)
MFF 12 4 
Total $ 342 $ 111 
(*)    Effective January 1, 2020, CCR AROs are being recovered through the ECCR tariff.
In July 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's modified triennial IRP (Georgia Power 2019 IRP), including
Georgia Power's proposed environmental compliance strategy associated with ash pond and certain landfill closures and post-
closure care in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery of
the estimated under recovered balance of these compliance costs at December 31, 2019 over a three-year period ending December
31, 2022 and recovery of estimated compliance costs for 2020, 2021, and 2022 over three-year periods ending December 31, 2022,
2023, and 2024, respectively, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditure. The
ECCR tariff is expected to be revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through future annual compliance filings. On
February 4, 2020, the Georgia PSC denied a motion for reconsideration filed by the Sierra Club regarding the Georgia PSC's(*)

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
decision in the 2019 ARP allowing Georgia Power to recover compliance costs for CCR AROs, and, on December 7, 2020, the
Superior Court of Fulton County affirmed the decision of the Georgia PSC. On January 5, 2021, the Sierra Club filed a notice of
appeal with the Georgia Court of Appeals. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 6 for
additional information regarding Georgia Power's AROs.
Under the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.50%, and earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of
9.50% to 12.00%. Any retail earnings above 12.00% will be shared, with 40% being applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40%
directly refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings
shortfall below 9.50% on an actual basis. However, if at any time during the term of the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power projects that its
retail earnings will be below 9.50% for any calendar year, it could petition the Georgia PSC for implementation of the Interim Cost
Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Power's retail rates to achieve a 9.50% ROE. The Georgia PSC would have 90 days to rule
on Georgia Power's request. The ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2023 or the end of the calendar year in which
the ICR tariff becomes effective. In lieu of requesting implementation of an ICR tariff, or if the Georgia PSC chooses not to
implement the ICR tariff, Georgia Power may file a full rate case. In 2020, Georgia Power's retail ROE was within the allowed
retail ROE range.
Additionally, under the 2019 ARP and pursuant to the sharing mechanism approved in the 2013 ARP whereby two-thirds of any
earnings above the top of the allowed ROE range are shared with Georgia Power's customers, (i) Georgia Power used 50%
(approximately $50 million) of the customer share of earnings above the band in 2018 to reduce regulatory assets and refunded
50% (approximately $50 million) to customers in 2020 and (ii) Georgia Power agreed to forego its share of 2019 earnings in excess
of the earnings band so 50% (approximately $60 million) of all earnings over the 2019 band were refunded to customers in 2020
and 50% (approximately $60 million) were used to reduce regulatory assets.
Except as provided above, Georgia Power will not file for a general base rate increase while the 2019 ARP is in effect. Georgia
Power is required to file a general base rate case by July 1, 2022, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to
determine whether the 2019 ARP should be continued, modified, or discontinued.
2013 ARP
Under the 2013 ARP, there were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariffs, ECCR tariff, DSM tariffs, or MFF tariffs in
2019. Georgia Power's retail ROE under the 2013 ARP was set at 10.95% and earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range
of 10.00% to 12.00%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.00% were to be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-
third retained by Georgia Power. In 2019 and 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00% and, under the modified sharing
mechanism pursuant to the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power reduced regulatory assets by a total of approximately $110 million and
accrued refunds for retail customers of a total of approximately $110 million. In June 2020 and October 2020, Georgia Power
issued bill credits to retail customers of approximately $50 million and $60 million, respectively, related to the excess retail
earnings in 2018 and 2019, respectively. See "2019 ARP" herein for additional information.
Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs
On April 7, 2020 and June 2, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Georgia
Power to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections through July 14, 2020 and to defer the resulting
incremental bad debt as a regulatory asset. On June 16, 2020 and July 7, 2020, the Georgia PSC approved orders establishing a
methodology for identifying incremental bad debt and allowing the deferral of other incremental costs associated with the COVID-
19 pandemic. The period over which such costs will be recovered is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate
case. At December 31, 2020, the incremental costs deferred totaled approximately $38 million. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. On May 28, 2020, the Georgia PSC approved
a stipulation agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors to lower total fuel billings by
approximately $740 million over a two-year period effective June 1, 2020. In addition, Georgia Power further lowered fuel billings
by approximately $44 million under an interim fuel rider effective June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Georgia Power
continues to be allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the under or
over recovered fuel balance exceeds $200 million. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its next fuel case no later than February 28,
2023.
Georgia Power's over recovered fuel balance totaled $113 million at December 31, 2020 and is included in other current liabilities
on Southern Company's balance sheets and over recovered fuel clause revenues on Georgia Power's balance sheets. At

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
December 31, 2019, Georgia Power's over recovered fuel balance totaled $73 million and is included in other deferred credits and
liabilities on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets.
Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and
approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 36-month time horizon.
Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and
amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern
Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.
Storm Damage Recovery
Georgia Power defers and recovers certain costs related to damages from major storms as mandated by the Georgia PSC. Beginning
January 1, 2020, Georgia Power is recovering $213 million annually under the 2019 ARP. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was $262 million and $410 million, respectively, with $213 million for each
year included in other regulatory assets, current on Southern Company's balance sheets and regulatory assets – storm damage on
Georgia Power's balance sheets and $49 million and $197 million, respectively, included in other regulatory assets, deferred on
Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. During October 2020, Tropical Storm Zeta caused significant damage to
Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this tropical storm deferred in
the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately $50 million. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be
adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not
expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements.
Nuclear Construction
In 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, in which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership
interest. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the
two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin.
Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a
substantially fixed price agreement.
In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing in March 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the
other Vogtle Owners, entered into several transitional arrangements to allow construction to continue. In July 2017, Georgia Power,
acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement, whereby Westinghouse
provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and
materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the
Vogtle Owners upon 30 days' written notice.
In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost
reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is
subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not
jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel
Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle
Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the
base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may
terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain
breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events.
See Note 8 under "Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" for information on the Amended and Restated Loan
Guarantee Agreement, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events, and conditions to
borrowing.

Cost and Schedule
Georgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by
the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows:
(in billions)
Base project capital cost forecast $ 8.5 
Construction contingency estimate 0.2 
Total project capital cost forecast 8.7 
Net investment as of December 31, 2020 (7.2)
Remaining estimate to complete $ 1.5 
(a)Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $246 million, of which $93 million had been accrued through
December 31, 2020.
(b)Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds.
Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $3.0 billion,
of which $2.6 billion had been incurred through December 31, 2020.
As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to
incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers
and related test results, and workforce statistics. Southern Nuclear has established aggressive target values for monthly construction
production and system turnover activities as part of a strategy that was designed to maintain margin to the regulatory-approved in-
service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.
As of June 30, 2020, assignments of contingency exceeded the remaining balance of the $366 million construction contingency
originally established in the second quarter 2018 by approximately $34 million and Georgia Power established $115 million of
additional construction contingency. During the third and fourth quarters 2020, this construction contingency, plus an additional $5
million, was fully assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Assignment of contingency during 2020 addressed cost risks related to
construction productivity, including the April 2020 reduction in workforce designed to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic described below; other COVID-19 impacts; craft labor incentives; additional resources for supervision, field support,
project management, initial test program, start-up, engineering support, and operations and maintenance support; subcontracts; and
procurement, among other factors. These factors continue to represent further potential cost risk to the project; therefore, Georgia
Power established $171 million of additional construction contingency as of December 31, 2020.
After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate
outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in
future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $149 million ($111 million after tax) and
$176 million ($131 million after tax) for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast as of June 30, 2020 and December
31, 2020, respectively. As and when these amounts are spent, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those
expenditures for rate recovery.
In mid-March 2020, Southern Nuclear began implementing policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of transmission of
COVID-19 at the construction site, including worker distancing measures, isolating individuals who have tested positive for
COVID-19, are showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, are being tested for COVID-19, or have been in close contact with
such persons, requiring self-quarantine, and adopting additional precautionary measures. In April 2020, Georgia Power, acting for
itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, announced a reduction in workforce at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and began
reducing the then-existing site workforce by approximately 20%. This reduction in workforce was a mitigation action intended to
address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 workforce and construction site, including
challenges with labor productivity that were exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, by increasing productivity of
the remaining workforce and reducing workforce fatigue and absenteeism. Further, it was also intended to allow for increased
social distancing by the workforce and facilitate compliance with the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The April 2020 workforce reduction did reduce absenteeism, providing an improvement in operational efficiency and
allowing for increased social distancing. Since April 2020, the number of active cases at the site has fluctuated and has continued to
impact productivity levels and pace of activity completion.
The lower productivity levels and slower pace of activity completion contributed to a backlog to the aggressive site work plan
established at the beginning of 2020. To address these issues, in July 2020, Southern Nuclear updated its aggressive site work plan
for both Unit 3 and Unit 4; however, through October 2020, the project continued to face challenges in meeting the updated(a)(b)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
aggressive site work plan targets including, but not limited to, overall construction and subcontractor labor productivity, resulting in
further extension of certain milestone dates in the aggressive site work plan. From November 2020 through January 2021, the
number of active COVID-19 cases at the site increased significantly, consistent with a national rise in cases, which further impacted
productivity and the pace of activity completion. In addition, and exacerbated by this rise in COVID-19 cases, the project continues
to face challenges including, but not limited to, higher than expected absenteeism; overall construction and subcontractor labor
productivity; system turnover and testing activities; and electrical equipment and commodity installation.
As a result of these factors, overall production levels were not achieved at the levels anticipated, contributing to the December 31,
2020 allocation of construction contingency and increase in total project capital cost forecast described previously. Georgia Power
estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule
margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4. Also, after considering these factors, Southern Nuclear has
further extended certain milestone dates, including the start of hot functional testing and fuel load for Unit 3, from those established
in October 2020. These updated milestone dates are expected to support the regulatory-approved in-service dates of November
2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. With minimal schedule margin remaining, the Unit 3 schedule is
challenged, and any further extension of the hot functional testing or fuel load milestones, or other delays from the challenges
described below, could impact the ability to achieve the November 2021 in-service date. As Unit 3 approaches hot functional
testing, achievement of the extended milestone dates for Unit 3 primarily depends on improvements in the pace of work package
completion and system turnovers, as well as the level of any required construction remediation work. Achievement of the extended
milestone dates for Unit 4 primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as
well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electrical and pipefitter craft labor, being added and maintained.
In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental cost associated with COVID-19
mitigation actions and impacts on construction productivity is currently estimated to be between $150 million and $190 million and
is included in the total project capital cost. As described previously, estimated costs associated with near-term COVID-19
mitigation actions and related impacts on construction productivity were included in the additional contingency established as of
December 31, 2020.
As construction, including subcontract work, continues and testing and system turnover activities increase, challenges with
management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly
in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor,
and/or related cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, installation, system turnover, and the initial testing and
start-up, including any required engineering changes or any remediation related thereto, of plant systems, structures, or components
(some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear
industry at this scale), any of which may require additional labor and/or materials; or other issues could arise and change the
projected schedule and estimated cost.
There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal
and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the
requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses,
including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. Findings resulting from such
inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests
have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. On August 10, 2020, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board rejected
the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League's (BREDL) May 11, 2020 petition challenging a license amendment request. The
staff of the NRC has issued the requested amendment to the combined construction and operating license for Plant Vogtle Unit 3.
BREDL appealed the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board decision to the NRC, which the NRC denied on December 22, 2020.
BREDL also filed a motion to reopen the proceeding and submitted an amended contention on December 7, 2020, which is pending
before the NRC.
In September 2020, Southern Nuclear notified the NRC of its intent to load fuel for Unit 3 in 2021. Various design and other
licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit
and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, may arise, which may
result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based
compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project
schedule that could result in increased costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any schedule extension beyond the regulatory-
approved in-service dates is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of approximately $25

million per month for Unit 3 and approximately $15 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC. While Georgia
Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine
whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through
regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.
Joint Owner Contracts
In November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and
4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective in August 2018, the Vogtle
Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint
ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle
Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against
Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners
is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.
As a result of an increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the
increase in the base capital costs in conjunction with the nineteenth VCM report in 2018, the holders of at least 90% of the
ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. In September 2018, the Vogtle
Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements
In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term
Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ),
MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially
mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership
Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term
Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide up to $300 million of funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership
interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG
SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other
Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into
certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet
(Global Amendments).
As previously disclosed, pursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying
construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC)
for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800
million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6
billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the
remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and
(iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the
EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining
Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. If the EAC is
revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-
time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in
exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess
of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion.
In addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii)
the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement,
or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate
recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's
costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional
amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the
first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which
Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more over the
most recently approved schedule.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Regulatory Matters
In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of $4.418 billion.
In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and
the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR
tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. At December 31, 2020, Georgia Power had recovered approximately $2.5
billion of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion are being recognized through AFUDC and
are expected to be recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; however, Georgia Power will not record
AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently $7.3 billion) and not
requested for rate recovery. On November 3, 2020, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to decrease the NCCR tariff
by $142 million annually, effective January 1, 2021.
Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In
2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of
the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009
certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia
Power.
In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency
matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related
order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The
Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth
VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was
reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed
from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable
and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that
any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact
of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related customer refunds) was found reasonable; (iv)
construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as
primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in
service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost
cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced
the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013
ARP) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from 10.00% to 8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from 8.30% to 5.30%,
effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt);
(viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's average cost of
long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would
be adjusted to include the costs related to Unit 3 and common facilities deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement.
The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June
1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not
lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE
reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $150 million, $75 million, and $100 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018,
respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $260 million and $200 million in 2021 and
2022, respectively. In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon
which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the
decision to continue construction.
In 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc., Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc., and Georgia Watch filed petitions in Fulton
County Superior Court seeking judicial review of the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order. The petitions were dismissed by the
Fulton County Superior Court and later remanded by the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Fulton County Superior Court issued
another order dismissing the petitions and, in August 2020, the petitioners withdrew their notice of appeal. This matter is now
concluded.
The Georgia PSC has approved 23 VCM reports covering periods through June 30, 2020, including total construction capital costs
incurred through that date of $8.1 billion (before $1.7 billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). The Georgia PSC's order approving the twenty-third VCM report also
instructed Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to develop a mutually-agreeable recommendation to the Georgia PSC by
the end of March 2021 regarding the procedure for and the timing, form, and substance of the rate adjustment filing related to the
Unit 3 and common facility costs. Georgia Power expects to file its twenty-fourth VCM report with the Georgia PSC on February
18, 2021, covering the period from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, requesting approval of $670 million of construction
capital costs incurred during that period.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC.
Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs.
These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the
costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses
are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates.
2019 Base Rate Case
On March 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff related to Mississippi Power's base rate case filed in November 2019 (Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement
Agreement).
Under the terms of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement, annual retail rates decreased approximately
$16.7 million, or 1.85%, effective for the first billing cycle of April 2020, based on a test year period of January 1, 2020 through
December 31, 2020, a 53% average equity ratio, an allowed maximum actual equity ratio of 55% by the end of 2020, and a 7.57%
return on investment.
Additionally, the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement: (i) established common amortization periods of four years
for regulatory assets and three years for regulatory liabilities included in the approved revenue requirement, including those related
to unprotected deferred income taxes; (ii) established new depreciation rates reflecting an annual increase in depreciation of
approximately $10 million; and (iii) excluded certain compensation costs totaling approximately $3.9 million. It also eliminated
separate rates for costs associated with Plant Ratcliffe and energy efficiency initiatives and includes such costs in the PEP, ECO
Plan, and ad valorem tax adjustment factor, as applicable. In accordance with the previous order of the Mississippi PSC suspending
the operation of PEP and the ECO Plan for 2018 through 2020, Mississippi Power submitted its 2021 ECO Plan filing on February
12, 2021 and plans to submit its 2021 PEP filing in March 2021.
Performance Evaluation Plan
Mississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. In recognition
that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, PEP includes
performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi
Power's performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to
prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric
service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Typically, two PEP filings are made
for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing and the PEP lookback filing. On July 24, 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved
Mississippi Power's revisions to the PEP compliance rate clause as agreed to in the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement
Agreement. These revisions include, among other things, changing the filing date for the annual PEP rate projected filing from
November of the immediately preceding year to March of the current year, utilizing a historic test year adjusted for "known and
measurable" changes, using discounted cash flow and regression formulas to determine base ROE, and moving all embedded ad
valorem property taxes currently collected in PEP to the ad valorem tax adjustment clause. The PEP lookback filing will continue to
be filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement.
In 2018, Mississippi Power revised its annual projected PEP filing for 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation.
The revised filing requested an increase of $26 million in annual revenues, based on a performance adjusted ROE of 9.33% and an
increased equity ratio of 50%. Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the
Mississippi PSC, with respect to the 2018 PEP filing and all unresolved PEP filings for prior years (2018 PEP Settlement
Agreement). Rates under the 2018 PEP Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018. The
2018 PEP Settlement Agreement provided for an increase of approximately $21.6 million in annual base retail revenues, which
excluded certain compensation costs contested by the MPUS, as well as approximately $2 million subsequently approved

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
for recovery through the 2018 Energy Efficiency Cost Rider. Under the 2018 PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power
deferred a portion of the contested compensation costs for 2018 and 2019 as a regulatory asset totaling $4 million, which was
included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019. These costs are being recovered over a
four-year period through March 2024 as approved in the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement.
Pursuant to the 2018 PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power's performance-adjusted allowed ROE was 9.31% and its
allowed equity ratio was capped at 51%, pending further review by the Mississippi PSC. In lieu of the requested equity ratio
increase, Mississippi Power retained $44 million of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform
Legislation. The Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement set amortization periods for the excess accumulated deferred
income taxes, as discussed under "2019 Base Rate Case" herein.
Pursuant to the 2018 PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power was not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years
2018, 2019, and 2020. Mississippi Power plans to submit its 2021 PEP filing in March 2021. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
Operations Review
In 2018, the Mississippi PSC began an operations review of Mississippi Power. The review includes, but is not limited to, a
comparative analysis of its costs, its cost recovery framework, and ways in which it may streamline management operations for the
reasonable benefit of ratepayers. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Reserve Margin Plan
In December 2019, Mississippi Power updated its proposed RMP, originally filed in 2018, as required by the Mississippi PSC. In
2018, Mississippi Power had proposed alternatives to reduce its reserve margin and lower or avoid operating costs, with the most
economic alternatives being the two-year and seven-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, respectively,
to the first quarter 2022 and the four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter
2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively. The December 2019 update noted that Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 currently have
long-term economics similar to Plant Watson Unit 5. The Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion by
Alabama Power of transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power.
On December 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order concluding the RMP docket and requiring Mississippi Power to
incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027
to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin. The order stated that Mississippi Power will be allowed to defer any
retirement-related costs as regulatory assets for future recovery. Mississippi Power's IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2021.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under "Other Matters – Mississippi Power" for
additional information on Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2.
Environmental Compliance Overview Plan
In accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory
asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations.
In 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved an annual increase in revenues related to the ECO Plan of approximately $17 million,
effective with the first billing cycle for September 2018. This increase represented the maximum 2% annual increase in revenues
and primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year. The increase was the result of Mississippi PSC approval of an
agreement between Mississippi Power and the MPUS to settle the 2018 ECO Plan filing (ECO Settlement Agreement) and was
sufficient to recover costs through 2019, including remaining amounts deferred from prior years along with the related carrying
costs. In accordance with the ECO Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power was not required to make any ECO Plan filings for
2018, 2019, and 2020, and any necessary adjustments were reflected in Mississippi Power's 2019 base rate case. The ECO
Settlement Agreement contains the same terms as the 2018 PEP Settlement Agreement described herein with respect to allowed
ROE and equity ratio.
In October 2019, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's July 2019 request for a CPCN to complete certain
environmental compliance projects, primarily associated with the Plant Daniel coal units co-owned 50% with Gulf Power. The total
estimated cost is approximately $125 million, with Mississippi Power's share of approximately $66 million being proposed for
recovery through its ECO Plan. Approximately $17 million of Mississippi Power's share is associated with ash pond closure and is
reflected in Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. See Note 6 for additional information on AROs and Note 3 under "Other Matters –
Mississippi Power" for additional information on Gulf Power's ownership in Plant Daniel.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
On February 12, 2021, Mississippi Power submitted its ECO Plan filing for 2021, which requested an annual decrease in revenues
of approximately $9 million primarily due to a change in the amortization periods of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Fuel Cost Recovery
Mississippi Power annually establishes and is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost recovery factor that is
approved by the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC approved an increase of $39 million effective February 2018, decreases of
$35 million and $24 million effective in February 2019 and 2020, respectively, and an increase of $2 million effective in February
2021. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, over recovered retail fuel costs totaled approximately $24 million and $23 million,
respectively, and were included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheets and over recovered regulatory
clause liabilities on Mississippi Power's balance sheets.
Mississippi Power has wholesale MRA and Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factors. Effective with the first billing cycles for
January 2019, 2020, and 2021, annual revenues under the wholesale MRA fuel rate increased $16 million, increased $1 million, and
decreased $5 million, respectively. The wholesale MB fuel rate did not change materially in any period presented. At December 31,
2020 and 2019, over recovered wholesale fuel costs totaled approximately $10 million and $6 million, respectively, and were
included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheets and over recovered regulatory clause liabilities on
Mississippi Power's balance sheets.
Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance
with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on
Mississippi Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.
Ad Valorem Tax Adjustment
Mississippi Power establishes annually an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC to collect the
ad valorem taxes paid by Mississippi Power. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, the annual revenues collected through the ad valorem tax
adjustment factor increased by $10 million, decreased by $2 million, and increased by $7 million, respectively. On February 12,
2021, Mississippi Power submitted its ad valorem tax adjustment factor filing for 2021, which requested an annual increase in
revenues of approximately $28 million, primarily due to higher ad valorem taxes and inclusion of the ad valorem taxes previously
recovered in PEP in accordance with the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
System Restoration Rider
Mississippi Power carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and general property. However,
Mississippi Power is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured casualty damage to its property, including
transmission and distribution facilities. As permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, Mississippi Power accrues for the cost
of such damage through an annual expense accrual which is credited to regulatory liability accounts for the retail and wholesale
jurisdictions. The cost of repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed $50,000 is charged to the
reserve. Every three years the Mississippi PSC, the MPUS, and Mississippi Power agree on SRR revenue level(s) for the ensuing
period, based on historical data, expected exposure, type and amount of insurance coverage, excluding insurance cost, and any
other relevant information. The accrual amount and the reserve balance are determined based on the SRR revenue level(s). If a
significant change in circumstances occurs, then the SRR revenue level can be adjusted more frequently if Mississippi Power, the
MPUS, and the Mississippi PSC deem the change appropriate. The property damage reserve accrual will be the difference between
the approved SRR revenues and the SRR revenue requirement. In addition, SRR allows Mississippi Power to set up a regulatory
asset, pending review, if the allowable actual retail property damage costs exceed the amount in the retail property damage reserve.
The SRR rate was zero for all years presented.
On October 28, 2020, Hurricane Zeta hit the Gulf Coast of Mississippi causing major damage to Mississippi Power's transmission
and distribution infrastructure and, as a result, approximately $43 million was charged to the retail property damage reserve. These
costs are expected to be addressed in a subsequent SRR rate filing. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this
time.
Mississippi Power made retail SRR annual expense accruals of $1 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the
retail property damage reserve balance was $4 million.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs
On April 14, 2020 and May 12, 2020, in order to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customers, the
Mississippi PSC approved orders directing Mississippi Power to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer
disconnections through May 26, 2020 and to defer as a regulatory asset all necessary and reasonable incremental costs or expenses
to plan, prepare, stage, or react to protect and keep safe its employees and customers, and to reliably operate its utility system
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The period over which such costs will be recovered is expected to be determined in a future PEP
filing. At December 31, 2020, the incremental costs deferred totaled approximately $1 million. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff
Mississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the
City of Collins, all located in southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term, cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff.
In 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed, and the FERC accepted, a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part
of the MRA tariff, under which Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy will share in providing electricity to the Cooperative
Energy delivery points under the tariff, effective January 1, 2018. The SSA may be cancelled by Cooperative Energy with 10 years
notice. As of December 31, 2020, Cooperative Energy has the option to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services
under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually, with required notice, up to a maximum total reduction of 11%, or approximately $9
million in cumulative annual base revenues.
In May 2019, the FERC accepted Mississippi Power's requested $3.7 million annual decrease in MRA base rates effective January
1, 2019, as agreed upon in a settlement agreement reached with its wholesale customers resolving all matters related to the Kemper
County energy facility, similar to the 2018 PEP Settlement Agreement, and reflecting the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation.
On June 25, 2020, the FERC accepted Mississippi Power's requested $2 million annual increase in MRA base rates effective June
1, 2020, as agreed upon in a settlement agreement reached with its wholesale customers.
Cooperative Energy Power Supply Agreement
Effective April 1, 2018, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy amended and extended a previous power supply agreement
(PSA) through March 31, 2021, which was subsequently extended through May 31, 2021. The amendment increased the total
capacity from 86 MWs to 286 MWs. The parties are currently negotiating a further extension of the agreement. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Cooperative Energy also has a 10-year network integration transmission service agreement (NITSA) with SCS for transmission
service to certain delivery points on Mississippi Power's transmission system through March 31, 2021. As a result of the PSA
amendment, Cooperative Energy and SCS also amended the terms of the NITSA, which the FERC approved, to provide for the
purchase of incremental transmission capacity from April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2021. On February 7, 2021, the NITSA was
renewed for a 10-year term beginning April 1, 2021.
Southern Company Gas
Utility Regulation and Rate Design
The natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates
charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies
approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on
rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based
primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed
charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta
Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer
consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer
demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas
has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit
exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility,
allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation,
energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer
service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. The utilities, including Nicor
Gas beginning in November 2019, have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage
conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. See
"Rate Proceedings" for additional information. Also see "Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects" for additional
information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural gas distribution utilities.

Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects
In addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and
Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure
replacement programs. Total capital expenditures incurred during 2020 for gas distribution operations were $1.5 billion.
The following table and discussions provide updates on the infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects at the natural
gas distribution utilities at December 31, 2020. These programs are risk-based and designed to update and replace cast iron, bare
steel, and mid-vintage plastic materials or expand Southern Company Gas' distribution systems to improve reliability and meet
operational flexibility and growth.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Nicor Gas
Illinois legislation allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system and
stipulates that rate increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average
of 4.0% or, in any given year, 5.5% of base rate revenues. In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the nine-year regulatory
infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the
Illinois Commission in 2018, Nicor Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to December 31, 2017 through base rates.
Additionally, the Illinois Commission's approval of Nicor Gas' rate case in October 2019 included $65 million in annual revenues
related to the recovery of program costs from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 under the Investing in Illinois program.
See "Rate Proceedings" herein for additional information, including additional amounts requested for recovery in the base rate case
filed in January 2021. Nicor Gas' capital expenditures related to qualifying projects under the Investing in Illinois program totaled
$396 million and $409 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Virginia Natural Gas
In September 2019, the Virginia Commission approved amendments to and extension of the Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy
(SAVE) program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program. The extension allows Virginia Natural Gas to continue
replacing aging pipeline infrastructure through 2024 and increases its authorized investment under the previously-approved plan
from $35 million to $40 million in 2019 with additional annual investments of $50 million in 2020, $60 million in 2021, $70
million in each year from 2022 through 2024, and a total potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a
maximum total investment over the six-year term (2019 through 2024) of $365 million.
The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In accordance with the base rate case filed with the
Virginia Commission in 2020, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to November 1, 2020 through base
rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to November 1, 2020 are currently being recovered through a separate rider and are
subject to future base rate case proceedings.
In December 2019, Virginia Natural Gas filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a 24.1-mile header improvement
project to improve resiliency and increase the supply of natural gas delivered to energy suppliers, including Virginia Natural Gas.
Following Virginia Natural Gas' notification on November 13, 2020 that it had terminated its agreements with the project's primary
customer, the Virginia Commission issued an order on December 1, 2020 dismissing Virginia Natural Gas' application for the
project. On December 15, 2020, Virginia Natural Gas filed a new application with the Virginia Commission for a 9.5-mile
interconnect project to serve its existing transportation customers. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this
time.
Atlanta Gas Light
GRAM
In December 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the continuation of GRAM as part of Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.
Various infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement
Program to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution
system and LNG facilities in Georgia, continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program
investments are included in annual base rate adjustments. The amounts to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not
incurred, costs have been recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. This
allowed cost is primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the infrastructure programs in place prior to GRAM.
These PRP costs are being recovered through GRAM and base rates until the earlier of the full recovery of the related under
recovered amount or December 31, 2025. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2020 was $113 million, including $59
million of unrecognized equity return. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See
"Rate Proceedings" and "Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts" herein for additional information.
Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to
extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in
Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by
the Georgia PSC.
Natural Gas Cost Recovery
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in
the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost
of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue
earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through
adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are
reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern
Company Gas' revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its
end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain
natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia
PSC. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the over recovered balances were $88 million and $74 million, respectively, which were
included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.
Rate Proceedings
Nicor Gas
In January 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a $137 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $93 million
related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program, effective in February 2018, based on a ROE of 9.8%.
In May 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' rehearing request for revised base rates to incorporate the reduction in
the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The resulting decrease of approximately $44 million in annual
base rate revenues became effective May 5, 2018. The benefits of the Tax Reform Legislation from January 25, 2018 through May
4, 2018 were refunded to customers via bill credits and concluded in the second quarter 2019.
In October 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base
rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on
a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a
revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.
On January 14, 2021, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission, requesting a $293 million increase in
annual base rate revenues, including $94 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program. The
requested increase is based on a projected test year ending December 31, 2022, a ROE of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.5%.
The Illinois Commission has an 11-month statutory time limit to rule on the requested increase, after which rate adjustments will be
effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Atlanta Gas Light
In 2018, Atlanta Gas Light revised its annual GRAM filing to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and requested a $16
million rate reduction. In May 2018, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual base rates to remain at
the 2017 level for 2018 and 2019, with customer credits of $8 million in each of July 2018 and October 2018 to reflect the impacts
of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Georgia PSC maintained Atlanta Gas Light's previously authorized earnings band based on a
ROE between 10.55% and 10.95% and increased the allowed equity ratio by 4% to an equity ratio of 55% to address the negative
cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation.
In December 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE
of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of
any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the
previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but
not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM
filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 may not exceed 5% of 2020
base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.
On July 1, 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its 2020 GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of
$37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation
established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case
order.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
On February 16, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a
long-range comprehensive planning process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light will develop and file at least
triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each i-CDP will include a 10-year forecast of interstate and intrastate
capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the first three years consistent with Atlanta Gas Light's current capacity
supply plan, and a 10-year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the related
revenue requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for
authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects. Atlanta Gas Light will file its first i-CDP later in 2021. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Virginia Natural Gas
In 2018, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Natural Gas' annual information form filing, which was based on the
previously authorized ROE range of 9.0% to 10.0%, with a midpoint of 9.5%, and reduced annual base rates by $14 million
effective January 1, 2019 due to lower tax expense as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, along with customer refunds, via bill
credits, for $14 million related to 2018 tax benefits deferred as a regulatory liability at December 31, 2018. These customer refunds
were completed in the first quarter 2019.
On June 1, 2020, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base
revenues of $49.6 million primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure, technology, and
workforce development. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month test year beginning November 1, 2020, a ROE of
10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54%. Interim rate adjustments became effective November 1, 2020, subject to refund. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs
As discussed under "Utility Regulation and Rate Design," the natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms
to recover bad debt expense, which will mitigate potential increases in bad debt expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Atlanta Gas Light
On April 30, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Atlanta Gas Light to
continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections. On June 22, 2020, the Georgia PSC ordered Atlanta Gas
Light to resume customer disconnections beginning July 1, 2020, with exceptions for customers still covered by a shelter-in-place
order. All suspensions for customer disconnections were lifted in October 2020. The orders provide the Marketers, including
SouthStar, with a mechanism to receive credits from Atlanta Gas Light for the base rates it charged to the Marketers of non-paying
customers during the suspension. Atlanta Gas Light expects to recover these credits through the annual GRAM revenue true-up
process, which would impact rates starting on January 1, 2022. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this
time.
Nicor Gas
On March 18, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Illinois Commission issued an order directing utilities to cease
disconnections for non-payment and to suspend the imposition of late payment fees or penalties. On June 18, 2020, the Illinois
Commission approved a stipulation pursuant to which Nicor Gas and other utilities in Illinois will provide more flexible credit and
collection procedures to assist customers with financial hardship and which authorizes a special purpose rider for recovery of the
following COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts: incremental costs directly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the
offset for COVID-19 pandemic-related credits received, foregone late fees, foregone reconnection charges, and the costs associated
with a bill payment assistance program. Nicor Gas resumed late payment fees on July 27, 2020 and, on October 1, 2020, began
recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts through the special purpose rider, which will continue over a 24-month
period. In response to an Illinois Commission request, Nicor Gas will continue to voluntarily suspend residential customer
disconnections for non-payment through March 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, Nicor Gas' related regulatory asset was $9
million.
Virginia Natural Gas
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Virginia Commission issued orders requiring Virginia Natural Gas to suspend
disconnections beginning on March 16, 2020 and also to suspend late payment and reconnection fees beginning on April 9, 2020;
these orders expired on October 5, 2020. On November 18, 2020, the Virginia legislature approved the continuation of these orders
until the declared state of emergency in Virginia ends. On April 29, 2020, the Virginia Commission authorized Virginia Natural Gas
to defer the following COVID-19 pandemic-related costs as a regulatory asset: incremental uncollectible expense

incurred, suspended late fees, suspended reconnection charges, carrying costs, and other incremental prudently incurred costs
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific recovery of the amounts deferred in a regulatory asset will be addressed in a
future rate proceeding. At December 31, 2020, Virginia Natural Gas' related regulatory asset was immaterial. The ultimate outcome
of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts
The following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance
sheets. These amounts are primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory
infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the
periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025.

General Litigation Matters
The Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory matters. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation or regulatory matters against each Registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time; however,
for current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising
from such current proceedings would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements.
The Registrants believe the pending legal challenges discussed below have no merit; however, the ultimate outcome of these
matters cannot be determined at this time.
Southern Company
In January 2017, a securities class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by
Monroe County Employees' Retirement System on behalf of all persons who purchased shares of Southern Company's common
stock between April 25, 2012 and October 30, 2013, as subsequently amended. The amended complaint named as defendants
Southern Company, certain of its current and former officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers and alleged that the
defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility in violation of certain
provisions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The complaint sought, among other things, compensatory
damages and litigation costs and attorneys' fees. In 2018, the court issued an order dismissing certain claims against certain officers
of Southern Company and Mississippi Power and dismissing the allegations related to a number of the statements that plaintiffs
challenged as being false or misleading. In 2018, the court denied the defendants' motion for reconsideration and also denied a
motion to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal. In 2019, the court certified the plaintiffs' proposed class and entered an order
staying all deadlines in the case pending mediation. In the third quarter 2020, the parties reached a settlement and the plaintiffs filed
a stipulation of settlement and motion for preliminary approval to resolve the case on a class-wide basis, which the court granted on
October 1, 2020. On January 14, 2021, the court granted final approval of the settlement. The settlement amount was paid entirely
through existing insurance policies and did not have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. This matter is
now concluded.
In February 2017, Jean Vineyard and Judy Mesirov each filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia. Each of these lawsuits names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its
current and former officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. In 2017, these two shareholder derivative lawsuits were
consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaints allege that the defendants caused
Southern Company to make false or misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility cost and schedule. Further,
the complaints allege that the defendants were unjustly enriched and caused the waste of corporate assets and also allege that the
individual defendants violated their fiduciary duties.
In May 2017, Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County,
Georgia that names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its current and former officers, and certain
II-170

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
former Mississippi Power officers. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants, among other things, breached their
fiduciary duties in connection with schedule delays and cost overruns associated with the construction of the Kemper County
energy facility. The complaint further alleges that the individual defendants authorized or failed to correct false and misleading
statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility schedule and cost and failed to implement necessary internal controls to
prevent harm to Southern Company. In August 2019, the court granted a motion filed by the plaintiff in July 2019 to substitute a
new named plaintiff, Martin J. Kobuck, in place of Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust.
The plaintiffs in each of these cases seek to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and, on each
plaintiff's own behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit, as well as certain changes to Southern Company's corporate
governance and internal processes. In 2018, the court in each case entered an order staying each lawsuit until 30 days after the
resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the securities class action. In September 2020, the
plaintiffs in each case filed a status report noting the settlement of the securities class action and informing the court that the parties
had scheduled mediation, which occurred on November 12, 2020. The parties in each case did not reach settlement but continue to
explore possible resolution. Each case is stayed while the parties discuss potential resolution.
Georgia Power
In 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative class action against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia alleging that
Georgia Power's collection in rates of amounts for municipal franchise fees (which fees are paid to municipalities) exceeded the
amounts allowed in orders of the Georgia PSC and alleging certain state law claims. This case has been ruled upon and appealed
numerous times over the last several years. In one recent appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court remanded the case and noted that the
trial court could refer the matter to the Georgia PSC to interpret its tariffs. Following a motion by Georgia Power, in February 2019,
the Superior Court of Fulton County ordered the parties to submit petitions to the Georgia PSC for a declaratory ruling and also
conditionally certified the proposed class. In March 2019, Georgia Power and the plaintiffs filed petitions with the Georgia PSC
seeking confirmation of the proper application of the municipal franchise fee schedule pursuant to the Georgia PSC's orders. Also
in March 2019, Georgia Power appealed the class certification decision to the Georgia Court of Appeals. In October 2019, the
Georgia PSC issued an order that found Georgia Power has appropriately implemented the municipal franchise fee schedule. On
March 11, 2020, the Georgia Court of Appeals vacated the Superior Court of Fulton County's February 2019 order granting
conditional class certification and remanded the case to the Superior Court of Fulton County for further proceedings. In September
2020, the plaintiffs and Georgia Power each filed motions for summary judgment and the plaintiffs renewed their motion for class
certification. The amount of any possible losses cannot be estimated at this time because, among other factors, it is unknown
whether a class will be certified, the ultimate composition of any class, and whether any losses would be subject to recovery from
any municipalities.
On July 29, 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia against Georgia
Power alleging that releases from Plant Scherer have impacted groundwater, surface water, and air, resulting in alleged personal
injuries and property damage. The plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of monetary damages including punitive damages, a
medical monitoring fund, and injunctive relief. In September 2020, Georgia Power filed a motion to dismiss. The amount of any
possible losses cannot be estimated at this time.
Mississippi Power
In 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the
three then-serving members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Mississippi
Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-
construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme
Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-
approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper. They
also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to $23.5 million in the refund process by applying an incorrect
interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-
judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. In response to Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC each
filing a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in March 2019. The amended complaint included four
additional plaintiffs and additional claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional wrongdoing. Mississippi Power
and the Mississippi PSC each filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which occurred on May 26, 2020 and March 27,
2020, respectively. Also on March 27, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to name the new members of the Mississippi PSC,
the Mississippi Development Authority, and Southern Company as additional defendants and add a cause of action against all
defendants based on a dormant commerce clause theory under the U.S. Constitution. On July 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion
for leave to file a third amended complaint, which included the same federal claims as the
II-171

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
proposed second amended complaint, as well as several additional state law claims based on the allegation that Mississippi Power
failed to disclose the annual percentage rate of interest applicable to refunds. On November 10, 2020, the court denied each of the
plaintiffs' pending motions and entered final judgment in favor of Mississippi Power. On January 22, 2021, the court denied further
motions by the plaintiffs to vacate the judgment and to file a revised second amended complaint. An adverse outcome in this
proceeding could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.
See "Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility" herein for additional information.
Environmental Remediation
The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of
waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur
substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities
conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known
impacted sites in the financial statements. A liability for environmental remediation costs is recognized only when a loss is
determined to be probable and reasonably estimable and is reduced as expenditures are incurred. The traditional electric operating
companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have each received authority from their respective state
PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory
mechanisms. Any difference between the liabilities accrued and costs recovered through rates is deferred as a regulatory asset or
liability. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other
applicable state regulatory agencies. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Alabama Power did not have environmental remediation
liabilities and Mississippi Power's balance was immaterial.
Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site
Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and assessment and
potential cleanup of such sites is expected. For 2020, 2019, and 2018, Georgia Power recovered approximately $12 million, $2
million, and $2 million, respectively, through the ECCR tariff for environmental remediation.
In December 2019, Mississippi Power entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality
related to groundwater conditions arising from the closed ash pond at Plant Watson. Mississippi Power will complete an assessment
and remediation consistent with the requirements of the agreement and the CCR Rule. It is anticipated that corrective action will be
needed; however, an estimate of remedial costs will not be available until further site assessment is completed. Mississippi Power
expects to recover the retail portion of remedial costs through the ECO Plan and the wholesale portion through MRA rates.
Southern Company Gas is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with 40 former MGP sites in four different
states. Southern Company Gas' accrued environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was based on the
estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with these sites.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
Acting through the DOE and pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. government entered into contracts with
Alabama Power and Georgia Power that required the DOE to dispose of spent nuclear fuel generated at Plants Farley, Hatch, and
Vogtle Units 1 and 2 beginning no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE has yet to commence the performance of its contractual
and statutory obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Consequently, Alabama Power and Georgia Power pursued and continue to
pursue legal remedies against the U.S. government for its partial breach of contract.
In 2014, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed lawsuits against the U.S. government for the costs of continuing to store spent
nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. The
damage period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2014. On June 12, 2019, the Court of Federal Claims granted Alabama
Power's and Georgia Power's motion for summary judgment on damages not disputed by the U.S. government, awarding those
undisputed damages to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. However, those undisputed damages are not collectible and no amounts
will be recognized in the financial statements until the court enters final judgment on the remaining damages.
In 2017, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed additional lawsuits against the U.S. government in the Court of Federal Claims
for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January
1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. On August 13, 2020, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed amended complaints in each of
the lawsuits adding damages from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 to the claim period.
The outstanding claims for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019 total $110 million and $132 million for Alabama
Power and Georgia Power (based on its ownership interests), respectively. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is
resolved, the U.S. government disposes of Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's spent nuclear fuel pursuant to its contractual
obligations, or alternative storage is otherwise provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial statements as of
December 31, 2020 for any potential recoveries from the pending lawsuits.
The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect to credit
any recoveries for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from their respective PSC; therefore, no material impact on
Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income is expected.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
On-site dry spent fuel storage facilities are operational at all three plants and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through
the expected life of each plant.
Nuclear Insurance
Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements of indemnity with the
NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies'
nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $13.8 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear
incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $450 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI),
with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear
incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $138 million per incident for each
licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $20 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor.
Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its
ownership and buyback interests in all licensed reactors, is $275 million and $267 million, respectively, per incident, but not more
than an aggregate of $41 million and $40 million, respectively, to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum
assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years. The next scheduled
adjustment is due no later than November 1, 2023. See Note 5 under "Joint Ownership Agreements" for additional information on
joint ownership agreements.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to
provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $1.5 billion for members' operating nuclear generating facilities.
Additionally, both companies have NEIL policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature
decommissioning coverage up to $1.25 billion for nuclear losses and policies providing coverage up to $750 million for non-
nuclear losses in excess of the $1.5 billion primary coverage.
NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage
at a member's nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage, subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a
maximum per occurrence per unit limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase limits based on
the projected full cost of replacement power, subject to ownership limitations, and have each elected a 12-week deductible waiting
period for each nuclear plant.
A builders' risk property insurance policy has been purchased from NEIL for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This
policy provides the Vogtle Owners up to $2.75 billion for accidental property damage occurring during construction.
Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments each year if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to
the insurer. The maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power as of December 31, 2020 under the NEIL
policies would be $56 million and $84 million, respectively.
Claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to normal policy
limits). The maximum aggregate that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from terrorist acts and cyber events in any 12-month
period is $3.2 billion each, plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.
For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such
policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any
remaining proceeds are to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the NRC,
and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the applicable company or to its debt trustees as may be appropriate
under the policies and applicable trust indentures. In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to
cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from
customers, would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, as applicable, and could have a material effect on Southern
Company's, Alabama Power's, and Georgia Power's financial condition and results of operations.
All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may be subject to applicable state
premium taxes.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Other Matters
Southern Company
As discussed in Note 1 under "Leveraged Leases," a subsidiary of Southern Holdings has four leveraged lease agreements, two
domestic and two international. The ability of the lessees to make required payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary is
dependent on the operational performance of the assets.
Since 2017, the financial and operational performance of one of the domestic lessees and the associated generation assets raised
significant concerns about the short-term ability of the generation assets to produce cash flows sufficient to support ongoing
operations and the lessee's contractual obligations and its ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments through the
end of the lease term in 2047. In addition, following the expiration of the existing power offtake agreement in 2032, the lessee also
is exposed to remarketing risk, which encompasses the price and availability of alternative sources of generation.
In connection with the 2019 annual impairment analysis, Southern Company revised the estimated cash flows to be received under
the leveraged lease, which resulted in an impairment charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) recorded in the fourth quarter
2019. During the second quarter 2020, Southern Company received the latest annual forecasts of natural gas prices and considered
the significant decline in forecasted prices to be an indicator of potential impairment that required an interim impairment
assessment. Accordingly, consistent with prior impairment analyses, Southern Company evaluated the recoverability of the lease
receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets under various natural gas price scenarios to estimate the cash
flows expected to be received from remarketing the generation assets following the expiration of the existing PPA and the residual
value of the generation assets at the end of the lease. Based on the current forecasts of energy prices in the years following the
expiration of the existing PPA, Southern Company concluded that it is no longer probable that any of the associated rental
payments will be received, because it is no longer probable the generation assets will be successfully remarketed and continue to
operate after that date. During the second quarter 2020, Southern Company revised the estimated cash flows to be received under
the leveraged lease to reflect this conclusion, which resulted in a full impairment of the lease investment and a pre-tax charge to
earnings of $154 million ($74 million after tax).
All required lease payments through December 31, 2020 have been paid in full. If any future lease payments due prior to the
expiration of the associated PPA are not paid in full, the Southern Holdings subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding
payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. Failure to make the required payment to
the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to foreclose on, and take ownership of,
the generation assets, in effect terminating the lease. As the remaining amount of the lease investment was charged against earnings
in the second quarter 2020, termination would not be expected to result in additional charges. Southern Company will continue to
monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make the required
lease payments and meet its obligations associated with a future closure or retirement of the generation assets and associated
properties, including the dry ash landfill.
During the fourth quarter 2020, Southern Company management initiated steps to sell the investment in its other domestic
leveraged lease and reclassified the investment as held for sale. In connection with the annual impairment analysis of this
investment, Southern Company management concluded that the estimated residual value of the generation assets should be reduced
due to significant uncertainty as to whether the related natural gas generation assets will continue to operate at the end of the lease
term in 2040 and recorded the resulting impairment charge. An additional charge was recorded to further reduce the related
investment in the leveraged lease to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The pre-tax charges to earnings in the fourth quarter
2020 totaled $52 million ($31 million after tax). See Note 15 under "Assets Held for Sale" for additional information.
The leveraged lease agreements for the two international projects include lessee purchase options related to the leased assets, which
consist of nine gas distribution networks and two district heating systems in the Netherlands. The lessee has communicated its
intent to exercise the first purchase option in 2022. The purchase options for the remaining ten assets are exercisable on various
dates through 2028 with at least one year's notice. The exercise of these purchase options is not expected to result in any gain or
loss.
Mississippi Power
Kemper County Energy Facility
The Kemper County energy facility was designed to utilize IGCC technology with an expected output capacity of 582 MWs and to
be fueled by locally mined lignite from a mine owned by Mississippi Power and situated adjacent to the Kemper County energy
facility. In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010
authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper County energy facility. Mississippi Power placed the

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper County energy facility in service in 2014 and
dedicated them as Plant Ratcliffe in 2018.
In 2017, the Mississippi PSC issued an order directing Mississippi Power to pursue a settlement under which the Kemper County
energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant, rather than an IGCC plant, and address all issues associated with the
Kemper County energy facility. Following this order, cost recovery of the gasifier portions was no longer probable and Mississippi
Power recorded significant charges to income in 2017.
In 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement for the Kemper County energy facility, which resolved all cost
recovery issues, modified the CPCN to limit the Kemper County energy facility to natural gas combined cycle operation, and
reduced retail customer rates by approximately $26.8 million annually based on a revenue requirement that included no recovery
for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility.
In 2018, 2019, and 2020, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income associated with abandonment and related closure costs and
ongoing period costs, net of salvage proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. These
charges, including related tax impacts, totaled $37 million pre-tax ($68 million benefit after tax) in 2018, $24 million pre-tax and
after tax in 2019, and $4 million pre-tax ($3 million after tax) in 2020. The pre-tax charges are included in other operations and
maintenance expenses on the statements of income.
Dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities are expected to be completed by 2026.
Additional pre-tax period costs associated with dismantlement and site restoration activities, including related costs for compliance
and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes, net of salvage, are estimated to total $10 million to $20 million annually through
2025.
The Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement eliminated separate rates associated with the Kemper County energy
facility and included these costs in rates for PEP, ECO Plan, and ad valorem taxes, as applicable, effective with the revised rates in
2020. See Note 2 under "Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case" for additional information.
Lignite Mine and CO Pipeline Facilities
Mississippi Power owns the lignite mine and equipment and mineral reserves located around the Kemper County energy facility
site. The mine started commercial operation in 2013. In connection with the Kemper County energy facility construction,
Mississippi Power also constructed a pipeline for the transport of captured CO.
In 2010, Mississippi Power executed a management fee contract with Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (Liberty Fuels), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, which developed, constructed, and is responsible for the mining
operations through the end of the mine reclamation. As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels has a legal obligation to perform
mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the
abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and was substantially completed in 2020, with
monitoring expected to continue through 2027. See Note 6 for additional information.
In December 2019, Mississippi Power transferred ownership of the COpipeline to an unrelated gas pipeline company, with no
resulting impact on income. In conjunction with the transfer of the COpipeline, the parties agreed to enter into a 15-year firm
transportation agreement, which became effective in December 2020, upon the conversion by the pipeline company of the CO
pipeline to a natural gas pipeline to be used for the delivery of natural gas to Plant Ratcliffe. The agreement is treated as a finance
lease for accounting purposes. See Note 9 for additional information.
Government Grants
In 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $270 million of the Kemper County energy facility
through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. In 2016, additional DOE
grants in the amount of $137 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. In 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the
DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the $387 million of total grants received. On
September 3, 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi
Power's request, which enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and
site restoration activities. The expected impact of the closeout agreement was accrued in 2019. In connection with the DOE
closeout discussions, in April 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi
Power of an investigation related to the grants received. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time;
however, it could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.2

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Plant Daniel
In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, NextEra Energy held back $75 million of the purchase price pending
Mississippi Power and Gulf Power negotiating a mutually acceptable revised operating agreement for Plant Daniel. In addition,
Mississippi Power and Gulf Power agreed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such
that each of them would, after the restructuring, own 100% of a generating unit. In January 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to
Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi
Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power
exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential operational and economic
effects of Gulf Power's notice. On April 24, 2020, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power amended the terms of their agreement to
extend the deadline from May 1, 2020 to August 1, 2020 for Mississippi Power to notify Gulf Power of which generating unit it has
selected for 100% ownership. The parties agreed not to select a specific unit by August 1, 2020 and are continuing negotiations on a
mutually acceptable revised operating agreement. The impacts of operating the units on an individual basis continue to be evaluated
by Mississippi Power and any transfer of ownership would be subject to approval by the FERC and the Mississippi PSC. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 15 under "Southern Company" for information
regarding the sale of Gulf Power.
Southern Company Gas
PennEast Pipeline Project
In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a partnership in which it holds a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline, an
interstate pipeline company formed to develop and operate an approximate 118-mile natural gas pipeline between New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. The expected initial transportation capacity of 1.0 Bcf per day is under long-term contracts, mainly with public
utilities and other market-serving entities, such as electric generation companies, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York.
Expected project costs related to the PennEast Pipeline for Southern Company Gas total approximately $300 million, excluding
financing costs. In 2018, the PennEast Pipeline received initial FERC approval. Work continues with state and federal agencies to
obtain the required permits to begin construction. On February 20, 2020, the FERC approved a two-year extension for PennEast
Pipeline to complete the project by January 19, 2022.
On January 30, 2020, PennEast Pipeline filed an amendment with the FERC to construct the pipeline project in two phases. The
first phase would consist of 68 miles of pipe, constructed entirely within Pennsylvania, which is expected to be completed in late
2022. The second phase would include the remaining route in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and is targeted for completion in 2024.
FERC approval of the amended plan is required prior to beginning the first phase.
In September 2019, an appellate court ruled that the PennEast Pipeline does not have federal eminent domain authority over lands
in which a state has property rights interests. On February 18, 2020, PennEast Pipeline filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to seek
U.S. Supreme Court review of the appellate court decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court granted on February 3, 2021.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, any work delays, whether caused by judicial or
regulatory action, abnormal weather, or other conditions, may result in additional cost or schedule modifications or, ultimately, in
project cancellation, any of which could result in impairment of Southern Company Gas' PennEast Pipeline investment and could
have a significant impact on Southern Company's financial statements and a material impact on Southern Company Gas' financial
statements. Southern Company Gas evaluated its $91 million investment and determined there was no impairment as of
December 31, 2020.
See Note 7 under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Natural Gas Storage Facility
In 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $91 million ($69 million after-tax) related to Jefferson
Island. On December 1, 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of this facility. See Note 15 under "Southern Company
Gas – Sale of Natural Gas Storage Facility" for additional information.
Commitments
To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the Southern Company system's electric generating plants, the Southern Company
system has entered into various long-term commitments not recognized on the balance sheets for the procurement and delivery of
fossil fuel and, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, nuclear fuel. The majority of the Registrants' fuel expense for the periods
presented was purchased under long-term commitments. Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its future fuel needs
will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of
Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether
or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2
investment relate to costs in excess of Georgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these
portions at the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in
Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power, non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income.
Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $5 million, $6 million, and $8 million in 2020, 2019, and
2018, respectively. At December 31, 2020, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $49
million, consisting of $5 million for 2021, $4 million for 2022, $3 million annually for 2023 through 2025, and $31 million
thereafter.
See Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.
Southern Company Gas has commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply, including charges recoverable
through natural gas cost recovery mechanisms or, alternatively, billed to marketers selling retail natural gas, as well as demand
charges associated with Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services. Gas supply commitments include amounts for gas
commodity purchases associated with Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services of 31 million mmBtu at floating gas prices
calculated using forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2020 and valued at $72 million. Southern Company Gas provides
guarantees to certain gas suppliers for certain of its subsidiaries in support of payment obligations. Southern Company Gas'
expected future contractual obligations for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply that are not recognized on the balance
sheets at December 31, 2020 were as follows:
Pipeline Charges, Storage
Capacity, and Gas Supply

As a 50% equity investor in SNG, Southern Company Gas is required to make additional capital contributions as necessary
pursuant to the terms of its operating agreement with SNG. SNG has $300 million of debt maturing in June 2021 that it anticipates
refinancing. If SNG is unable to refinance or otherwise satisfy this debt obligation, Southern Company Gas has committed to fund
up to $150 million as a contingent capital contribution. See Note 7 under "Southern Company Gas" for additional information.
Guarantees
SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent for the traditional electric
operating companies and Southern Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional electric operating companies and
Southern Power may be jointly and severally liable. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements with
each of the traditional electric operating companies to ensure they will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses,
liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these agreements.
Alabama Power has guaranteed a $100 million principal amount long-term bank loan entered into by SEGCO in 2018. Georgia
Power has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the portion of such obligation corresponding to Georgia Power's proportionate
ownership of SEGCO's stock if Alabama Power is called upon to make such payment under its guarantee. At December 31, 2020,
the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $85 million of equity and $100 million of long-term debt that matures in November 2021,
on which the annual interest requirement is derived from a variable rate index. In addition, SEGCO had short-term debt outstanding
of $25 million. See Note 7 under "SEGCO" for additional information.
As discussed in Note 9, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees related to railcar
leases.

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and
replacement of minor items of property is charged to other operations and maintenance expenses as incurred or performed with the
exception of nuclear refueling costs and certain maintenance costs including those described below.
In accordance with orders from their respective state PSCs, Alabama Power and Georgia Power defer nuclear refueling outage
operations and maintenance expenses to a regulatory asset when the charges are incurred. Alabama Power amortizes the costs over
a subsequent 18-month period with Plant Farley's fall outage cost amortization beginning in January of the following year and
spring outage cost amortization beginning in July of the same year. Georgia Power amortizes its costs over each unit's operating
cycle, or 18 months for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and 24 months for Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power's amortization
period begins the month the refueling outage starts.
A portion of Mississippi Power's railway track maintenance costs is charged to fuel stock and recovered through Mississippi
Power's fuel clause.
The portion of Southern Company Gas' non-working gas used to maintain the structural integrity of natural gas storage facilities
that is considered to be non-recoverable is depreciated, while the recoverable or retained portion is not depreciated.
See Note 9 for information on finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, net, which are included in property, plant, and equipment.
The Registrants have deferred certain implementation costs related to cloud hosting arrangements. Once a hosted software is placed
into service, the related deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected hosting arrangement term,
including any renewal options that are reasonably certain of exercise. The amortization is reflected with the associated cloud
hosting fees, which are generally reflected in other operations and maintenance expenses on the Registrants' statements of income.
At December 31, 2020, deferred cloud implementation costs, which are generally included in other deferred charges and assets on
the Registrants' balance sheets, are as follows:

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Depreciation and Amortization
The traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service
is provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates. The approximate rates for 2020, 2019, and 2018 are as follows:
2020 2019 2018
Alabama Power 2.6 % 3.1 % 3.0 %
Georgia Power 3.0 % 2.6 % 2.6 %
Mississippi Power 3.7 % 3.7 % 4.2 %
Southern Company Gas 2.8 % 2.9 % 2.9 %
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are filed with the respective state PSC
and/or other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas
distribution utilities. During 2020, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Atlanta Gas Light revised their depreciation rates in
accordance with base rate case approvals by their respective PSCs. The revised rates were effective January 1, 2020 for Georgia
Power and Atlanta Gas Light and April 1, 2020 for Mississippi Power. See Note 2 for additional information.
When property, plant, and equipment subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other
property dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet accounts, and a gain or
loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the asset are retired when the related property unit is
retired.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accumulated depreciation for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas consisted of utility
plant in service totaling $31.6 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively, for Southern Company and $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion,
respectively, for Southern Company Gas, as well as other plant in service totaling $817 million and $732 million, respectively, for
Southern Company and $195 million and $155 million, respectively, for Southern Company Gas. Other plant in service includes
the non-utility assets of Southern Company Gas, as well as, for Southern Company, certain other non-utility subsidiaries.
Depreciation of the original cost of other plant in service is provided primarily on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.
Useful lives for Southern Company Gas's non-utility assets range from five to 12 years for transportation equipment, 30 to 75 years
for storage facilities, and up to 75 years for other assets. Useful lives for the assets of Southern Company's other non-utility
subsidiaries range up to 37 years.
Southern Power
Southern Power applies component depreciation, where depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of the asset. Certain of Southern Power's generation assets related to natural gas-fired facilities are depreciated
on a units-of-production basis, using hours or starts, to better match outage and maintenance costs to the usage of, and revenues
from, these assets. The primary assets in Southern Power's property, plant, and equipment are generating facilities, which generally
have estimated useful lives as follows:
Southern Power Generating Facility Useful life
Natural gas Up to 50 years
Solar Up to 35 years
Wind Up to 30 years
(*)Effective January 1, 2020, Southern Power revised the depreciable lives of its natural gas generating facilities from up to 45 years to up to 50 years. This
revision resulted in an immaterial decrease in depreciation for 2020.
When Southern Power's depreciable property, plant, and equipment is retired, or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed and a gain or loss is recognized in the statements of income.
Southern Power reviews its estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could result
in changes which could have a material impact on Southern Power's net income.(*)

6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in
which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of
future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the
timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future
removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance
from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for
long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations
are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as
regulatory assets.
The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule
and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations
related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in
Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See "Nuclear Decommissioning" herein for additional information. Other significant
AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum
cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind
facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as
obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term
assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of
polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these
assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is
indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these
retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the
ARO.
Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of
income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance
with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as
either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
During 2019, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling approximately $312 million to its AROs primarily related to the CCR
Rule and the related state rule based on management's completion of closure designs during the second and third quarters 2019
under the planned closure-in-place methodology for all but one of its ash pond facilities. During 2019, Mississippi Power recorded
an increase of approximately $57 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule, primarily associated with the ash pond facility at
Plant Greene County, which is jointly owned with Alabama Power. During 2020, Alabama Power recorded increases totaling
approximately $501 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule primarily as a result of management's
completion of the closure design for the remaining ash pond and the addition of a water treatment system to the design of another
ash pond. The additional estimated costs to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology primarily relate
to inputs from contractor bids, design revisions, and changes in the expected volume of ash handling.
During the second half of 2019, Georgia Power completed an assessment of its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating
plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. Cost estimates were revised to reflect further refined costs for
closure plans and updates to the timing of future cash outlays. As a result, in December 2019, Georgia Power recorded a decrease
of approximately $174 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. During the third quarter 2020,
Georgia Power further refined the related cost estimates, including updates to long-term post-closure care requirements, market
pricing, and timing of future cash outlays. As a result, in September 2020, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately
$411 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule.
The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2020 using various
assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential
methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have
periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR
unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates
may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by
environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash
flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted.
See Note 2 under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time.
Nuclear Decommissioning
The NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds
for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's
regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the
IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers,
neither Southern Company nor its subsidiaries or affiliates are allowed to engage in the day-to-day management of the Funds or to
mandate individual investment decisions. Day-to-day management of the investments in the Funds is delegated to unrelated third-
party managers with oversight by the management of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The Funds' managers are authorized,
within certain investment guidelines, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the return on
the Funds' investments. The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities
and are reported as trading securities.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power record the investment securities held in the Funds at fair value, as disclosed in Note 13, as
management believes that fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, are
recorded in the regulatory liability for AROs in the balance sheets and are not included in net income or OCI. Fair value
adjustments and realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.
The Funds at Georgia Power participate in a securities lending program through the managers of the Funds. Under this program,
Georgia Power's Funds' investment securities are loaned to institutional investors for a fee. Securities loaned are fully collateralized
by cash, letters of credit, and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. At
December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately $44 million and $28 million, respectively, of the fair market value of Georgia Power's
Funds' securities were on loan and pledged to creditors under the Funds' managers' securities lending program. The fair value of the
collateral received was approximately $45 million and $29 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and can only be
sold by the borrower upon the return of the loaned securities. The collateral received is treated as a non-cash item in the statements
of cash flows.

The investment securities held in the Funds continue to be managed with a long-term focus. Accordingly, all purchases and sales
within the Funds are presented separately in the statements of cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the nature of the
securities and purpose for which the securities were acquired.
For Alabama Power, approximately $15 million and $16 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, previously recorded
in internal reserves is being transferred into the Funds through 2040 as approved by the Alabama PSC. The NRC's minimum
external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a
nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed plans with the NRC designed to
ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

Total $ 1,145 $ 1,013 
Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The decommissioning cost estimates are
based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from these
estimates because of changes in the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the
assumptions used in making these estimates. The estimated costs of decommissioning at December 31, 2020 based on the most
current studies, which were each performed in 2018, were as follows:

Non-radiated structures 99 56 79 
Total site study costs $ 1,720 $ 962 $ 842 
(*)Based on Georgia Power's ownership interests.
For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power's decommissioning costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power's
decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities and the site
study estimate for spent fuel management as of 2018. Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an
estimated inflation rate of 4.5% and 2.75% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and an estimated trust earnings
rate of 7.0% and 4.75% for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively.
Amounts previously contributed to the Funds for Plant Farley are currently projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning
obligations. Alabama Power will continue to provide site-specific estimates of the decommissioning costs and related projections of
funds in the external trust to the Alabama PSC and, if necessary, would seek the Alabama PSC's approval to address any changes in
a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements.
Effective January 1, 2020, in connection with the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is a
total of $4 million for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking in
2019 totaled $5 million.
7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
The Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership
interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a VIE. If a venture is a VIE for which a Registrant
is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the
conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.
For entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the
investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are(*) (*)

consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the
balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity
method investments in the statements of income. See "SEGCO" and "Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information.
SEGCO
Alabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating
units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Alabama Power and Georgia Power
account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally
to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating
expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the
statements of income totaled $67 million in 2020, $93 million in 2019, and $102 million in 2018 for Alabama Power and $69
million in 2020, $95 million in 2019, and $105 million in 2018 for Georgia Power.
SEGCO paid dividends of $12 million in 2020, $14 million in 2019, and $18 million in 2018, one half of which were paid to each
of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net
income.
Alabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership
agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the
remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.
See Note 3 under "Guarantees" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to
SEGCO.
Southern Power
Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of
these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the VIEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets,
and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.
SP Solar and SP Wind
In 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% limited partnership interest in SP Solar to Global Atlantic Financial Group
Limited (Global Atlantic). See Note 15 under "Southern Power" for additional information. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern
Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest in SP Solar and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern
Power owns the remaining 66% ownership in SP Solar. SP Solar qualifies as a VIE since the arrangement is structured as a limited
partnership and the 33% limited partner does not have substantive kick-out rights against the general partner.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, SP Solar had total assets of $6.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $387
million and $381 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated
67% to Southern Power and 33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership interest percentage. Under the terms of the
limited partnership agreement, distributions without limited partner consent are limited to available cash and SP Solar is obligated
to distribute all such available cash to its partners each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the quarter subject to
the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves.
In 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax-equity interest in SP Wind to three financial investors. SP Wind owns eight
operating wind farms. See Note 15 under "Southern Power" for additional information. Southern Power owns 100% of the Class B
membership interests and the three financial investors own 100% of the Class A membership interests. SP Wind qualifies as a VIE
since the structure of the arrangement is similar to a limited partnership and the Class A members do not have substantive kick-out
rights against Southern Power.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, SP Wind had total assets of $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, total liabilities of $138
million and $128 million, respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $43 million and $45 million, respectively. Under the terms of
the limited liability agreement, distributions without Class A member consent are limited to available cash and SP Wind is obligated
to distribute all such available cash to its members each quarter. Available cash includes all cash generated in the

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
quarter subject to the maintenance of appropriate operating reserves. Cash distributions from SP Wind are generally allocated 60%
to Southern Power and 40% to the three financial investors in accordance with the limited liability agreement.
Southern Power consolidates both SP Solar and SP Wind, as the primary beneficiary, since it controls the most significant activities
of each entity, including operating and maintaining their assets. Certain transfers and sales of the assets in the VIEs are subject to
partner consent and the liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of Southern Power. Liabilities consist of customary working
capital items and do not include any long-term debt.
Other Variable Interest Entities
Southern Power has other consolidated VIEs that relate to certain subsidiaries that have either sold noncontrolling interests to tax-
equity investors or acquired less than a 100% interest from facility developers. These entities are considered VIEs because the
arrangements are structured similar to a limited partnership and the noncontrolling members do not have substantive kick-out
rights.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the other VIEs had total assets of $1.1 billion, total liabilities of $110 million and $104 million,
respectively, and noncontrolling interests of $454 million and $409 million, respectively. Under the terms of the partnership
agreements, distributions of all available cash are required each month or quarter and additional distributions require partner
consent.
Equity Method Investments
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Southern Power had equity method investments in wind and battery storage projects totaling $19
million and $28 million, respectively.
Southern Company Gas
Equity Method Investments
The carrying amounts of Southern Company Gas' equity method investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and related income

(c)Pollution control revenue bond obligations represent loans to the traditional electric operating companies from public authorities of funds derived from sales by
such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control and solid waste disposal facilities. In some cases, the pollution control revenue bond
obligations represent obligations under installment sales agreements with respect to facilities constructed with the proceeds of revenue bonds issued by public
authorities. The traditional electric operating companies are required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet principal and interest requirements
of such bonds. Proceeds from certain issuances are restricted until qualifying expenditures are incurred.
(d)Secured by substantially all of Nicor Gas' properties.

Guarantee Agreement in March 2019. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee
the obligations of Georgia Power under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, Georgia Power may make term
loan borrowings through the FFB in an amount up to approximately $5.130 billion, provided that total aggregate borrowings under
the FFB Credit Facilities may not exceed 70% of (i) Eligible Project Costs minus (ii) approximately $1.492 billion (reflecting the
amounts received by Georgia Power under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement less the related customer refunds).
In June and December 2020, Georgia Power made borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount of
$519 million and $329 million, respectively, at an interest rate of 1.652% and 1.737%, respectively, through the final maturity date
of February 20, 2044. During 2020, Georgia Power made principal amortization payments of $73 million under the FFB Credit
Facilities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Georgia Power had $4.6 billion and $3.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the
FFB Credit Facilities, respectively.
All borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities are full recourse to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power is obligated to reimburse the
DOE for any payments the DOE is required to make to the FFB under its guarantee. Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to
the DOE are full recourse and secured by a first priority lien on (i) Georgia Power's 45.7% undivided ownership interest in Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (primarily the units under construction, the related real property, and any nuclear fuel loaded in the reactor
core) and (ii) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. There are
no restrictions on Georgia Power's ability to grant liens on other property.
In addition to the conditions described above, future advances are subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, as well as
certification of compliance with the requirements of the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program, including accuracy of project-related
representations and warranties, delivery of updated project-related information, and evidence of compliance with the prevailing
wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, as amended, and certification from the DOE's consulting engineer that
proceeds of the advances are used to reimburse Eligible Project Costs.
Upon satisfaction of all conditions described above, advances may be requested on a quarterly basis through 2023. The final
maturity date for each advance under the FFB Credit Facilities is February 20, 2044. Interest is payable quarterly and principal
payments began on February 20, 2020. Borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities will bear interest at the applicable U.S. Treasury
rate plus a spread equal to 0.375%.
Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, Georgia Power is subject to customary borrower affirmative and
negative covenants and events of default. In addition, Georgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other
project-specific covenants and events of default.(a) (b) (c) (d)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
In the event certain mandatory prepayment events occur, the FFB's commitment to make further advances under the FFB Credit
Facilities will terminate and Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the
FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years (with level principal amortization). Among other things, these mandatory
prepayment events include (i) the termination of the Vogtle Services Agreement or rejection of the Vogtle Services Agreement in
any Westinghouse bankruptcy if Georgia Power does not maintain access to intellectual property rights under the related
intellectual property licenses; (ii) termination of the Bechtel Agreement, unless the Vogtle Owners enter into a replacement
agreement; (iii) cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the Georgia PSC or by Georgia Power; (iv) failure of the holders of
90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to vote to continue construction following certain schedule extensions;
(v) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or
Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities; or (vi) loss of or failure to receive
necessary regulatory approvals. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from an event of taking must be
applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Georgia Power also may voluntarily prepay
outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, any prepayment (whether mandatory or
optional) will be made with a make-whole premium or discount, as applicable.
In connection with any cancellation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the DOE may elect to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units
3 and 4. In such an event, the DOE will have the right to assume Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal
agreements relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and to acquire all or a portion of Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Secured Debt
Each of Southern Company's subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from Southern Company and its other
subsidiaries. There are no agreements or other arrangements among the Southern Company system companies under which the
assets of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of Southern Company or any of its
other subsidiaries.
As discussed under "Long-term Debt" herein, the Registrants had secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Each
Registrant's senior notes, junior subordinated notes, pollution control and other revenue bond obligations, bank term loans, credit
facility borrowings, and notes payable are effectively subordinated to all secured debt of each respective Registrant.
Equity Units
In August 2019, Southern Company issued 34.5 million 2019 Series A Equity Units (Equity Units), initially in the form of
corporate units (Corporate Units), at a stated amount of $50 per Corporate Unit, for a total stated amount of $1.725 billion. Net
proceeds from the issuance were approximately $1.682 billion. The proceeds were used to repay short-term indebtedness and for
other general corporate purposes, including investments in Southern Company's subsidiaries.
Each Corporate Unit is comprised of (i) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of Southern
Company's Series 2019A Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes (Series 2019A RSNs) due 2024, (ii) a 1/40 undivided beneficial
ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of Southern Company's Series 2019B Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes
(together with the Series 2019A RSNs, the RSNs) due 2027, and (iii) a stock purchase contract, which obligates the holder to
purchase from Southern Company, no later than August 1, 2022, a certain number of shares of Southern Company's common stock
for $50 in cash (Stock Purchase Contract). Southern Company has agreed to remarket the RSNs in 2022, at which time each
interest rate on the RSNs will reset at the applicable market rate. Holders may choose to either remarket their RSNs, receive the
proceeds, and use those funds to settle the related Stock Purchase Contract or retain the RSNs and use other funds to settle the
related Stock Purchase Contract. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, holders will have the right to put their RSNs to Southern
Company at a price equal to the principal amount. The Corporate Units carry an annual distribution rate of 6.75% of the stated
amount, which is comprised of a quarterly interest payment on the RSNs of 2.70% per year and a quarterly purchase contract
adjustment payment of 4.05% per year.
Each Stock Purchase Contract obligates the holder to purchase, and Southern Company to sell, for $50 a number of shares of
Southern Company common stock determined based on the applicable market value (as determined under the related Stock
Purchase Contract) in accordance with the conversion ratios set forth below (subject to anti-dilution adjustments):
•If the applicable market value is equal to or greater than $68.64, 0.7284 shares.
•If the applicable market value is less than $68.64 but greater than $57.20, a number of shares equal to $50 divided by the
applicable market value.
•If the applicable market value is less than or equal to $57.20, 0.8741 shares.

COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
A holder's ownership interest in the RSNs is pledged to Southern Company to secure the holder's obligation under the related Stock
Purchase Contract. If a holder of a Stock Purchase Contract chooses at any time to have its RSNs released from the pledge, such
holder's obligation under such Stock Purchase Contract must be secured by a U.S. Treasury security equal to the aggregate principal
amount of the RSNs. At the time of issuance, the RSNs were recorded on Southern Company's consolidated balance sheet as long-
term debt and the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $198 million was recorded as a liability, representing the
obligation to make contract adjustment payments, with an offsetting reduction to paid-in capital. The liability balance at
December 31, 2020 was $119 million, of which $67 million was classified as current. The difference between the face value and
present value of the contract adjustment payments is being accreted to interest expense on the consolidated statements of income
over the three-year period ending in 2022. The liability recorded for the contract adjustment payments is considered non-cash and
excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. To settle the Stock Purchase Contracts, Southern Company will be
required to issue a maximum of 30.2 million shares of common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments and a make-whole
adjustment if certain fundamental changes occur).
Bank Credit Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows:

(a)Does not include Southern Power Company's $75 million and $60 million continuing letter of credit facilities for standby letters of credit expiring in 2023, of
which $5 million and $11 million, respectively, was unused at December 31, 2020. In December 2020, Southern Power amended its $120 million letter of credit
facility, which, among other things, extended the expiration date from 2021 to 2023 and reduced the amount to $75 million. Southern Power's subsidiaries are
not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.
(b)Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $1.25 billion of this
arrangement. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement also includes $500 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted for
working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to this multi-year credit arrangement, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may
be adjusted. See "Structural Considerations" herein for additional information.
The bank credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of the commitments. Commitment
fees average less than /4 of 1% for the Registrants and Nicor Gas. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and
its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith,
Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments
thereunder.
These bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of the Registrants and SEGCO, contain covenants that limit
debt levels and contain cross-acceleration or, in the case of Southern Power, cross-default provisions to other indebtedness
(including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such cross-default
provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Southern Power defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee
obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if
the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company's, Southern
Company Gas', and Nicor Gas' credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 70% of total capitalization, as defined
in the agreements, and the other subsidiaries' bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total
capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated
trusts and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities. Additionally, for Southern Company and Southern Power, for purposes
of these definitions, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is
non-recourse to Southern Power and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such(a)

subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO were in compliance with all such covenants. None of
the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.
A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric
operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants and Nicor Gas. The amount of variable rate revenue
bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2020 was
approximately $1.4 billion (comprised of approximately $854 million at Alabama Power, $550 million at Georgia Power, and $34
million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2020, Georgia Power and Mississippi Power had approximately $174
million and $50 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12
months.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Southern Power had $105 million and $104 million, respectively, of cash collateral posted related
to PPA requirements, which is included in other deferred charges and assets on Southern Power's consolidated balance sheets.
Notes Payable
The Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the
liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above under "Bank Credit Arrangements." Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not parties or obligors to its commercial paper program. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper
programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and at Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports working capital
needs at Nicor Gas as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of Southern Company Gas' other
subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program. See "Structural Considerations" herein for
additional information.
In addition, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various bank term loan agreements. Unless
otherwise stated, the proceeds of these loans were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including
working capital and, for the subsidiaries, their continuous construction programs.

Diluted Earnings Per Share
For Southern Company, the only differences in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are attributable to awards
outstanding under stock-based compensation plans and the Equity Units. Earnings per share dilution resulting from stock-based
compensation plans and the Equity Units issuance is determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute diluted
EPS were as follows:

As reported shares 1,058 1,046 1,020 
Effect of stock-based compensation 7 8 5 
Diluted shares 1,065 1,054 1,025 
In all years presented, an immaterial number of stock-based compensation awards was not included in the diluted EPS calculation
because the awards were anti-dilutive.
The Equity Units were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for 2020 and 2019 as the dilutive stock price threshold was not
met.
Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries
As discussed further under "Alabama Power" herein, the preferred stock of Alabama Power is presented as "Redeemable Preferred
Stock of Subsidiaries" on Southern Company's balance sheets in a manner consistent with temporary equity under applicable
accounting standards.
In 2018, Mississippi Power completed the redemption of all outstanding shares and depository shares of its redeemable preferred
stock totaling $33 million, as described further under "Mississippi Power" herein.
Alabama Power
Alabama Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, and common stock outstanding. Alabama Power also has authorized
preference stock, none of which is outstanding. Alabama Power's preferred stock and Class A preferred stock, without preference
between classes, rank senior to Alabama Power's common stock with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary and
involuntary dissolution. The preferred stock and Class A preferred stock of Alabama Power contain a feature that allows the holders
to elect a majority of Alabama Power's board of directors if preferred dividends are not paid for four consecutive quarters. Because
such a potential redemption-triggering event is not solely within the control of Alabama Power, the preferred stock and Class A
preferred stock is presented as "Redeemable Preferred Stock" on Alabama Power's balance sheets in a manner consistent with
temporary equity under applicable accounting standards.
Alabama Power's preferred stock is subject to redemption at a price equal to the par value plus a premium. Alabama Power's Class
A preferred stock is subject to redemption at a price equal to the stated capital. All series of Alabama Power's preferred stock
currently are subject to redemption at the option of Alabama Power. The Class A preferred stock is subject to redemption on or after
October 1, 2022, or following the occurrence of a rating agency event. Information for each outstanding series is in the table below:

Georgia Power
Georgia Power has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common stock authorized, but only common
stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Mississippi Power
Mississippi Power has preferred stock and common stock authorized, but only common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020
and 2019. In 2018, Mississippi Power completed the redemption of all outstanding shares and depository shares of its Preferred
Stock.
Dividend Restrictions
The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020,
consolidated retained earnings included $5.6 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained
earnings or paid-in-capital.
See Note 7 under "Southern Power" for information regarding the distribution requirements for certain Southern Power
subsidiaries.
By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to
affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2020, the amount of Southern Company
Gas' subsidiary retained earnings restricted for dividend payment totaled $1.1 billion.
Structural Considerations
Since Southern Company and Southern Company Gas are holding companies, the right of Southern Company and Southern
Company Gas and, hence, the right of creditors of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas to participate in any distribution
of the assets of any respective subsidiary of Southern Company or Southern Company Gas, whether upon liquidation,
reorganization or otherwise, is subject to prior claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of such subsidiary.
Southern Company Gas' 100%-owned subsidiary, Southern Company Gas Capital, was established to provide for certain of
Southern Company Gas' ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt, hybrid
securities, and other financing arrangements. Southern Company Gas fully and unconditionally guarantees all debt issued by
Southern Company Gas Capital. Nicor Gas is not permitted by regulation to make loans to affiliates or utilize Southern Company
Gas Capital for its financing needs.
Southern Power Company's senior notes, bank term loan, commercial paper, and bank credit arrangement are unsecured senior
indebtedness, which rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Southern Power Company. Southern Power's
subsidiaries are not issuers, borrowers, or obligors, as applicable, under any of these unsecured senior debt arrangements, which are
effectively subordinated to any future secured debt of Southern Power Company and any potential claims of creditors of Southern
Power's subsidiaries.
9. LEASES
On January 1, 2019, the Registrants adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 842 (as amended), Leases (ASC 842), which
require lessees to recognize leases with a term of greater than 12 months on the balance sheet as lease obligations, representing the
discounted future fixed payments due, along with ROU assets that will be amortized over the term of each lease.
The Registrants elected the transition methodology provided by ASC 842, whereby the applicable requirements were applied on a
prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods. The Registrants also elected the
package of practical expedients provided by ASC 842 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain,
leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, the Registrants applied the use-of-
hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows
existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed.

Other 93 8 12 1 — — 
Total $ 2,070 $ 160 $ 1,582 $ 6 $ 398 $ 92 
Real estate/land leases primarily consist of commercial real estate leases at Southern Company, Georgia Power, and Southern
Company Gas and various land leases primarily associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power. The commercial
real estate leases have remaining terms of up to 24 years while the land leases have remaining terms of up to 46 years, including
renewal periods.
Communication towers are leased for the installation of equipment to provide cellular phone service to customers and to support
the automated meter infrastructure programs at the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas. Communication tower
leases have original terms of up to 10 years with options to renew for periods up to 20 years.
Renewal options exist in many of the leases. Except as otherwise noted, the expected term used in calculating the lease obligation
generally reflects only the noncancelable period of the lease as it is not considered reasonably certain that the lease will be
extended. Land leases associated with renewable energy facilities at Southern Power and communication tower leases for
automated meter infrastructure at Southern Company Gas include renewal periods reasonably certain of exercise resulting in an
expected lease term at least equal to the expected life of the renewable energy facilities and the automated meter infrastructure,
respectively.
Contracts that Contain a Lease
While not specifically structured as a lease, some of the PPAs at Alabama Power and Georgia Power are deemed to represent a
lease of the underlying electric generating units when the terms of the PPA convey the right to control the use of the underlying
assets. Amounts recorded for leases of electric generating units are generally based on the amount of scheduled capacity payments
due over the remaining term of the PPA, which varies between three and 17 years. Georgia Power has several PPAs with Southern
Power that Georgia Power accounts for as leases with a lease obligation of $575 million and $624 million at December 31, 2020
and 2019, respectively. The amount paid for energy under these affiliate PPAs reflects a price that would be paid in an arm's-length
transaction as reviewed and approved by the Georgia PSC.
Short-term Leases
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Registrants generally recognize lease
expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Residual value guarantees exist primarily in railcar leases at Alabama Power and Georgia Power and the amounts probable of being
paid under those guarantees are included in the lease payments. All such amounts are immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and
2019.
Lease and Nonlease Components
For all asset categories, with the exception of electric generating units, gas pipelines, and real estate leases, the Registrants combine
lease payments and any nonlease components, such as asset maintenance, for purposes of calculating the lease obligation and the
right-of-use asset.

The Registrants are each considered lessors in various arrangements that have been determined to contain a lease due to the
customer's ability to control the use of the underlying asset owned by the applicable Registrant. For the traditional electric
operating companies, these arrangements consist of outdoor lighting contracts accounted for as operating leases with initial terms of
up to seven years, after which the contracts renew on a month-to-month basis at the customer's option. For Mississippi Power, these
arrangements also include a tolling arrangement related to an electric generating unit accounted for as a sales-type lease with a
remaining term of 18 years. For Southern Power, these arrangements consist of PPAs related to electric generating units, including
renewable energy facilities, accounted for as operating leases with remaining terms of up to 26 years. Southern Company Gas is the
lessor in operating leases related to gas pipelines with remaining terms of up to 22 years. For Southern

No profit or loss was recognized by Mississippi Power upon commencement of a tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type
lease during the first quarter 2019. Mississippi Power completed construction of additional leased assets under the lease during
2020 and, upon completion, the book value of $26 million was transferred from CWIP to lease receivables, of which $24 million
and $2 million is included in other property and investments and other accounts and notes receivable, respectively, at December 31,
2020. The transfer represented a non-cash investing transaction for purposes of the statements of cash flows. Construction of

Southern Power receives payments for renewable energy under PPAs accounted for as operating leases that are considered
contingent rents and are therefore not reflected in the table above. Alabama Power and Southern Power allocate revenue to the
nonlease components of PPAs based on the stand-alone selling price of capacity and energy. The undiscounted cash flows to be
received under outdoor lighting contracts accounted for as operating leases at Mississippi Power are immaterial.
10. INCOME TAXES
Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of
which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's
current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to
that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the federal tax liability.
Federal Tax Reform Legislation
Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – "Income Tax
Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year
from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Following the 2017 tax return
filing in the fourth quarter 2018, each of the Registrants considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation
on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be
complete as of December 31, 2018.

Southern Company's and Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs generated in the current tax year and carried forward from prior tax
years that cannot be utilized in the current tax year are reclassified from current to deferred taxes in federal income tax expense in
the tables above. Southern Power's ITCs and PTCs reclassified in this manner include $5 million for 2020, $51 million for 2019,

and $128 million for 2018. Southern Power received $340 million, $734 million, and $5 million of cash related to federal ITCs
under renewable energy initiatives in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. See "Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities" and "Tax Credit
Carryforwards" herein for additional information.
In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred federal ITCs for the traditional electric operating companies are deferred and
amortized over the average life of the related property, with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation
and amortization in the statements of income. Southern Power's and the natural gas distribution utilities' deferred federal ITCs, as
well as certain state ITCs for Nicor Gas, are deferred and amortized to income tax expense over the life of the respective asset.
ITCs amortized in 2020, 2019, and 2018 were immaterial for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company
Gas and were as follows for Southern Company and Southern Power:
Southern Company Southern Power
(in millions)
2020 $ 84 $ 59 
2019 181 151 
2018 87 58 
When Southern Power recognizes tax credits, the tax basis of the asset is reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net
deferred tax asset. Southern Power has elected to recognize the tax benefit of this basis difference as a reduction to income tax
expense in the year in which the plant reaches commercial operation. The tax benefit of the related basis differences reduced
income tax expense by $5 million and $1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
State ITCs and other state credits, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Georgia Power's
income tax expense by $67 million in 2020, $51 million in 2019, and $21 million in 2018.
Southern Power's federal and state PTCs, which are recognized in the period in which the credits are generated, reduced Southern
Power's income tax expense by $15 million in 2020, $12 million in 2019, and $141 million in 2018.
Legal Entity Reorganizations
In 2018, Southern Power completed the final stage of a legal entity reorganization of various direct and indirect subsidiaries that
own and operate substantially all of its solar facilities, including certain subsidiaries owned in partnership with various third parties,
and also completed a legal entity reorganization of eight operating wind facilities under a new holding company, SP Wind. The
reorganizations resulted in net state tax benefits related to certain changes in apportionment rates totaling approximately $65
million, which were recorded in 2018.
Effective Tax Rate
Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction,
non-taxable AFUDC equity at the traditional electric operating companies, flowback of excess deferred income taxes at the
regulated utilities, and federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs primarily at Southern Power.

The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have tax-related regulatory assets (deferred
income tax charges) and regulatory liabilities (deferred income tax credits). The regulatory assets are primarily attributable to tax
benefits flowed through to customers in prior years, deferred taxes previously recognized at rates lower than the current enacted tax
law, and taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The regulatory liabilities are primarily attributable to deferred taxes previously
recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized ITCs. See Note 2 for each Registrant's related
balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The estimated tax credit utilization reflects the various sale transactions described in Note 15 and could be further delayed by
numerous factors, including the acquisition of additional renewable projects, the purchase of rights to additional PTCs of Plant
Vogtle Units 3 and 4 pursuant to certain joint ownership agreements, potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in
taxable income projections. See Note 2 under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" for additional information on Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4.
At December 31, 2020, Georgia Power also had approximately $343 million in net state investment and other net state tax credit
carryforwards for the State of Georgia that will expire between tax years 2021 and 2030 and are not expected to be fully utilized.
Georgia Power has a net state valuation allowance of $28 million associated with these carryforwards.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits
Changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented were as follows:
Southern Company
(in millions)
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 $ 18 
Tax position changes – decrease from prior periods (18)
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 and 2019 $ — 
Tax positions changes – increase from prior periods 44 
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020 $ 44 
The unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2020 and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2020 relate to a 2019 state tax filing position to exclude certain gains from 2019 dispositions from taxation in a certain unitary
state. If accepted by the state, this position would decrease Southern Company's annual effective tax rate. The ultimate outcome of
this unrecognized tax benefit is dependent on completion of the related state audit, which is not expected to be resolved within the
next 12 months.
All of the Registrants classify interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. Accrued interest for all tax positions was immaterial
for all years presented. None of the Registrants accrued any penalties on uncertain tax positions.
The IRS has finalized its audits of Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through 2019. Southern Company
is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process of the IRS. The audits for the Registrants' state income tax returns have either
been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2015.
11. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan covering substantially all employees, with the
exception of PowerSecure employees. The qualified pension plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated for the year ending
December 31, 2021. The Southern Company system also provides certain non-qualified defined benefits for a select group of
management and highly compensated employees, which are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Southern Company system
provides certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The
traditional electric operating companies fund other postretirement trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory
commissions. Southern Company Gas has a separate unfunded supplemental retirement health care plan that provides medical care
and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses. For the year ending December 31, 2021, no contributions to
any other postretirement trusts are expected.
On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy. See Note 15 under "Southern
Company" for additional information. All amounts presented in this note reflect the benefit plan obligations and related plan assets
for the Southern Company system's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the amounts attributable to Gulf
Power prior to January 1, 2019.

The Registrants estimate the expected rate of return on pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets using a financial
model to project the expected return on each current investment portfolio. The analysis projects an expected rate of return on each
of the different asset classes in order to arrive at the expected return on the entire portfolio relying on each trust's target asset
allocation and reasonable capital market assumptions. The financial model is based on four key inputs: anticipated returns by asset
class (based in part on historical returns), each trust's target asset allocation, an anticipated inflation rate, and the projected impact
of a periodic rebalancing of each trust's portfolio. Prior to 2020, the Registrants set the expected rate of return assumption using
asset return modeling based on geometric returns that reflect the compound average returns for dependent annual periods.
Beginning in 2020, the Registrants set the expected rate of return assumption using an arithmetic mean which represents the
expected simple average return to be earned by the pension plan assets over any one year. The Registrants believe the use of the
arithmetic mean is more compatible with the expected rate of return's function of estimating a single year's investment return.

Actuarial losses of $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion were recorded in the remeasurement of the Southern Company system pension

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is included in operations and maintenance expenses and all other
components of net periodic pension cost are included in other income (expense), net in the Registrants' statements of income.
Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against the expected return on plan assets.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related
value of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Registrants have elected to amortize changes in the
market value of return-seeking plan assets over five years and to recognize the changes in the market value of liability-hedging plan
assets immediately. Given the significant concentration in return-seeking plan assets, the accounting value of plan assets that is
used to calculate the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.
Effective January 1, 2020, Southern Company changed its method of calculating the market-related value of the liability-hedging
securities included in its pension plan assets. The market-related value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets
component of net periodic pension cost. Southern Company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan assets, which
smoothed asset returns and deferred gains and losses by amortizing them into the calculation of the market-related value over five
years. Southern Company changed to the fair value approach for liability-hedging securities, which includes measuring the market-
related value of that portion of the plan assets at fair value for purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets. The
remaining asset classes of plan assets will continue to be valued using the calculated value approach. Southern Company considers
the fair value approach to be preferable for liability-hedging securities because it results in a current reflection of changes in the
value of plan assets in the measurement of net periodic pension cost more consistent with the change in the related obligations.
Southern Company determined the effect of this change in accounting method was immaterial to the historical

and current financial statements of all Registrants; therefore, the effect of the change was recorded through earnings as a prior
period adjustment for the amounts related to the unregulated businesses of Southern Company and Southern Power. Amounts
related to the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities were reflected as adjustments to
regulatory assets, consistent with the expected regulatory treatment.
Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used to measure the projected
benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2020, estimated benefit payments were as follows:

Benefit Plan Assets
Pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. The Registrants' investment policies for both the pension plans and the other
postretirement benefit plans cover a diversified mix of assets as described below. Derivative instruments may be used to gain
efficient exposure to the various asset classes and as hedging tools. Additionally, the Registrants minimize the risk of large losses
primarily through diversification but also monitor and manage other aspects of risk.
The investment strategy for plan assets related to the Southern Company system's qualified pension plan is to be broadly diversified
across major asset classes. The asset allocation is established after consideration of various factors that affect the assets and
liabilities of the pension plan including, but not limited to, historical and expected returns and interest rates, volatility, correlations
of asset classes, the current level of assets and liabilities, and the assumed growth in assets and liabilities. Because a significant
portion of the liability of the pension plan is long-term in nature, the assets are invested consistent with long-term investment
expectations for return and risk. To manage the actual asset class exposures relative to the target asset allocation, the Southern
Company system employs a formal rebalancing program. As additional risk management, external investment managers and
service providers are subject to written guidelines to ensure appropriate and prudent investment practices. Management believes the
portfolio is well-diversified with no significant concentrations of risk.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
Investment Strategies and Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values
A description of the major asset classes that the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are comprised of, along with the
valuation methods used for fair value measurement, is provided below:
Description Valuation Methodology
Domestic equity: A mix of large and small capitalization stocks
with generally an equal distribution of value and growth
attributes, managed both actively and through passive index
approaches.
International equity: A mix of large and small capitalization
growth and value stocks with developed and emerging markets
exposure, managed both actively and through fundamental
indexing approaches.Domestic and international equities such as common stocks,
American depositary receipts, and real estate investment trusts
that trade on public exchanges are classified as Level 1
investments and are valued at the closing price in the active
market. Equity funds with unpublished prices that are comprised
of publicly traded securities (such as commingled/pooled funds)
are also valued at the closing price in the active market, but are
classified as Level 2.
Fixed income: A mix of domestic and international bonds.Investments in fixed income securities, including fixed income
pooled funds, are generally classified as Level 2 investments and
are valued based on prices reported in the market place.
Additionally, the value of fixed income securities takes into
consideration certain items such as broker quotes, spreads, yield
curves, interest rates, and discount rates that apply to the term of
a specific instrument.
Trust-owned life insurance (TOLI): Investments of taxable
trusts aimed at minimizing the impact of taxes on the portfolio.Investments in TOLI policies are classified as Level 2
investments and are valued based on the underlying investments
held in the policy's separate accounts. The underlying assets are
equity and fixed income pooled funds that are comprised of
Level 1 and Level 2 securities.
Special situations: Investments in opportunistic strategies with
the objective of diversifying and enhancing returns and
exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as investments in
promising new strategies of a longer-term nature.
Real estate: Investments in traditional private market, equity-
oriented investments in real properties (indirectly through pooled
funds or partnerships) and in publicly traded real estate
securities.
Private equity: Investments in private partnerships that invest in
private or public securities typically through privately-negotiated
and/or structured transactions, including leveraged buyouts,
venture capital, and distressed debt.Investments in real estate, private equity, and special situations
are generally classified as Net Asset Value as a Practical
Expedient, since the underlying assets typically do not have
publicly available observable inputs. The fund manager values
the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the
nature of the underlying investments. Techniques may include
purchase multiples for comparable transactions, comparable
public company trading multiples, discounted cash flow
analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates, recent sales of
comparable investments, and independent third-party appraisals.
The fair value of partnerships is determined by aggregating the
value of the underlying assets less liabilities.
For purposes of determining the fair value of the pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets and the appropriate level

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
The majority of PSUs and RSUs awarded contain terms where employees become immediately vested in PSUs and RSUs upon
retirement. As a result, compensation expense for employees that are retirement eligible at the grant date is recognized immediately,
while compensation expense for employees that become retirement eligible during the vesting period is recognized over the period
from grant date to the date of retirement eligibility. In addition, the Registrants recognize forfeitures as they occur.
All unvested PSUs and RSUs vest immediately upon a change in control where Southern Company is not the surviving
corporation.
Performance Share Units
PSUs granted to employees vest at the end of a three-year performance period. Shares of Southern Company common stock are
delivered to employees at the end of the performance period with the number of shares issued ranging from 0% to 200% of the
target number of PSUs granted, based on achievement of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of the
Southern Company Board of Directors.
Southern Company has issued three types of PSUs, each with a unique performance goal. These types of PSUs include total
shareholder return (TSR) awards based on the TSR for Southern Company common stock during the three-year performance period
as compared to a group of industry peers; ROE awards based on Southern Company's equity-weighted return over the performance
period; and EPS awards based on Southern Company's cumulative EPS over the performance period. EPS awards were last granted
in 2017.
The fair value of TSR awards is determined as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. In determining the fair
value of the TSR awards issued to employees, the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Southern Company's
stock over a period equal to the performance period. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant that covers the performance period of the awards. The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model

Expected term (in years) 3 3 3
Interest rate 1.4% 2.4% 2.4%
Weighted average grant-date fair value $77.65 $62.71 $43.75
The Registrants recognize TSR award compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year performance period
without remeasurement.
The fair values of EPS awards and ROE awards are based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the
date of the grant. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the ROE awards granted during 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $68.42,
$49.38, and $43.49, respectively. Compensation expense for EPS and ROE awards is generally recognized ratably over the three-
year performance period adjusted for expected changes in EPS and ROE performance. Total compensation cost recognized for
vested EPS awards and ROE awards reflects final performance metrics.
Southern Company had 2.5 million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2019. In February 2020, the PSUs that vested for
the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2019 were converted into 1.8 million shares outstanding at a share price of
$68.59. During 2020, Southern Company granted 1.2 million PSUs and 1.5 million PSUs were vested or forfeited, resulting in 2.2
million unvested PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2020. In February 2021, the PSUs that vested for the three-year performance
period ended December 31, 2020 were converted into 2.5 million shares outstanding at a share price of $60.10.

Total PSU compensation cost and the related tax benefit recognized in income were immaterial for all periods presented for all
other Registrants. The compensation cost related to the grant of Southern Company PSUs to the employees of each Subsidiary
Registrant is recognized in each Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity representing a
capital contribution from Southern Company.
At December 31, 2020, Southern Company's total unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs was $32 million and is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 19 months. The total unrecognized compensation cost
related to PSUs as of December 31, 2020 was immaterial for all other Registrants.
Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing stock price of Southern Company common stock on the date of the grant. The
weighted average grant-date fair values of RSUs granted during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $67.60, $50.44, and $43.81,
respectively. For most RSU awards, one-third of the RSUs vest each year throughout a three-year service period and compensation
cost for RSUs is generally recognized over the corresponding one-, two-, or three-year vesting period. Shares of Southern Company
common stock are delivered to employees at the end of each vesting period.
Southern Company had 1.3 million RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2019. During 2020, Southern Company granted 0.5 million
RSUs and 0.6 million RSUs were vested or forfeited, resulting in 1.2 million unvested RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2020,
including RSUs related to employee retention agreements.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, Southern Company's total compensation cost for RSUs recognized in
income was $29 million, $28 million, and $27 million, respectively. The related tax benefit also recognized in income was $8
million, $7 million, and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Total unrecognized
compensation cost related to RSUs as of December 31, 2020 for Southern Company of $11 million will be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 18 months.
Total RSUs outstanding and total compensation cost and related tax benefit for the RSUs recognized in income for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, as well as the total unrecognized compensation cost as of December 31, 2020, were
immaterial for all other Registrants. The compensation cost related to the grant of Southern Company RSUs to the employees of
each Subsidiary Registrant is recognized in such Subsidiary Registrant's financial statements with a corresponding credit to equity
representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.
Stock Options
In 2015, Southern Company discontinued granting stock options. As of December 31, 2017, all stock option awards were vested
and compensation cost fully recognized. Stock options expire no later than 10 years after the grant date and the latest possible
exercise will occur by November 2024. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the options
outstanding and exercisable was approximately two years.

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value measurements are based on inputs of observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is
minimized for fair value measurement and reflects a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques
used for fair value measurement.
•Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is either directly or indirectly observable.
•Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of each Registrant of what a market
participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If there is little available market data, then each Registrant's own
assumptions are the best available information.
In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement represents the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

Valuation Methodologies
The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and
physical power products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry
and are valued using the market approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas
prices, power prices, implied volatility, and overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-
counter products that are valued using observable market data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair
value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based
on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract
terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair value of cross-currency swaps
reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of
future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms,
counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under
Fair Value Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note 14 for
additional information on how these derivatives are used.
For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the non-qualified deferred
compensation trusts, external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary
pricing source. For investments held within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the
net asset value, which is established by obtaining the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A
market price secured from the primary source vendor is then evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the
trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather market data (including indices and market research
reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector news into proprietary pricing models,
pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading levels and pricing
analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available.
The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of
funds for future decommissioning. See Note 6 under "Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional information.
Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to certain acquisitions whereby it is primarily obligated to make
generation-based payments to the seller, which commenced at the commercial operation of the respective facility and continue
through 2026. The obligations are categorized as Level 3 under Fair Value Measurements as the fair value is determined using
significant unobservable inputs for the forecasted facility generation in MW-hours, as well as other inputs such as a fixed dollar
amount per MW-hour, and a discount rate. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the net present value of expected
payments and any periodic change arising from forecasted generation is expected to be immaterial.
"Other investments" include investments traded in the open market that have maturities greater than 90 days, which are categorized
as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements and are comprised of corporate bonds, bank certificates of deposit, treasury bonds,
and/or agency bonds.
The fair value measurements of private equity investments held in Alabama Power's nuclear decommissioning trusts that are
calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaled $76 million and $56 million at
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Unfunded commitments related to the private equity investments totaled $73 million
and $70 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Private equity investments include high-quality private equity
funds across several market sectors and funds that invest in real estate assets. Private equity funds do not have redemption rights.
Distributions from these funds will be received as the underlying investments in the funds are liquidated.

(*)The long-term debt of Southern Company Gas is recorded at amortized cost, including the fair value adjustments at the effective date of the 2016 merger with
Southern Company. Southern Company Gas amortizes the fair value adjustments over the remaining lives of the respective bonds, the latest being through 2043.
The fair values are determined using Level 2 measurements and are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or
on the current rates available to the Registrants.
Commodity Contracts with Level 3 Valuation Inputs
As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of Southern Company Gas' Level 3 physical natural gas forward contracts was $28
million. Since commodity contracts classified as Level 3 typically include a combination of observable and unobservable
components, the changes in fair value may include amounts due in part to observable market factors, or changes to assumptions on
the unobservable components. The following table includes transfers to Level 3, which represent the fair value of Southern
Company Gas' commodity derivative contracts that include a significant unobservable component for the first time during the

The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires the use of certain unobservable inputs. All forward pricing used in the
valuation of such contracts is directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quotes and exchange settlements, when that
data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that
maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some
forward prices used for determining fair value, reflect the best available market information. Unobservable inputs are updated using
industry standard techniques such as extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and
other relevant data. Level 3 physical natural gas forward contracts include unobservable forward price inputs (ranging from $(0.08)
to $0.24 per mmBtu). Forward price increases (decreases) as of December 31, 2020 would have resulted in higher (lower) values
on a net basis.(*) (*)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
14. DERIVATIVES
Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas are exposed to
market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk.
To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of
natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in
areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas operations use various
contracts in its commercial activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. For the traditional electric operating
companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used
primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.
Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net
basis. See Note 13 for additional fair value information. In the statements of cash flows, any cash impacts of settled energy-related
and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. Any cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are
classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with the classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively.
See Note 1 under "Financial Instruments" for additional information.
Energy-Related Derivatives
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to
hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other
various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have limited
exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain
of the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of
their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which are
expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating
capacity) and Southern Power have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-
term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating
companies and Southern Power may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any
uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity. Southern Company Gas retains exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile
energy market, be material and can adversely affect its results of operations.
Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of operating margins in the event of
warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non-
exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded
contracts are reflected in operating revenues.
Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods:
•Regulatory Hedges – Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional
electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are
initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel
is used in operations and ultimately recovered through an approved cost recovery mechanism.
•Cash Flow Hedges – Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to
hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in the statements of income in
the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions.
•Not Designated – Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred.
Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is
both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled
physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item
representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Report
At December 31, 2020, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest
hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:

Southern Power 10 2022 2021
Southern Company Gas 523 2022 2031
(*)Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments include both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short
position is a contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of long natural gas positions of 4,421 million mmBtu and short
natural gas positions of 3,898 million mmBtu at December 31, 2020, which is also included in Southern Company's total volume.
At December 31, 2020, the net volume of Southern Power's energy-related derivative contracts for power to be sold was 1 million
MWHs, all of which expire in 2021.
In addition to the volumes discussed above, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical
natural gas supply contracts that provide the option to sell back excess natural gas due to operational constraints. The maximum
expected volume of natural gas subject to such a feature is 29 million mmBtu for Southern Company, which includes 7 million
mmBtu for Alabama Power, 9 million mmBtu for Georgia Power, 4 million mmBtu for Mississippi Power, and 9 million mmBtu
for Southern Power.
For cash flow hedges of energy-related derivatives, the estimated pre-tax gains (losses) expected to be reclassified from AOCI to
earnings for the year ending December 31, 2021 are immaterial for all Registrants.
Interest Rate Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness. Derivatives related to existing
variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives' fair value gains or
losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and presented on the same income statement line item
as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value
hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to
earnings on the same income statement line item. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated or fail to qualify
as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.(*)

for the Southern Company parent entity, 2035 for Alabama Power, 2044 for Georgia Power, 2028 for Mississippi Power, and 2046
for Southern Company Gas.
Foreign Currency Derivatives
Southern Company and certain subsidiaries, including Southern Power, may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge
exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency
other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the derivatives'
fair value gains or losses are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings at the same time and on the same income statement
line as the earnings effect of the hedged transactions, including foreign currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S.
currency exchange rates. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness.

Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts
Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into derivative
contracts that may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and payables for routine
billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements. Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also utilize master
netting agreements to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. These agreements may contain provisions that permit netting
across product lines and against cash collateral. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are
presented net to the extent that there are netting arrangements or similar agreements with the counterparties.

The pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial for all other Registrants for
all years presented.
Contingent Features
Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas do not have any
credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit
rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, the Registrants had no collateral posted with
derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.
For the Registrants with interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2020, there were no interest rate derivative liabilities with
contingent features. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the
maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or
Baa3, were immaterial for all Registrants. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related
contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could
require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below
investment grade. Following the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy, Gulf Power is continuing to participate in the Southern
Company power pool for a defined transition period that, subject to certain potential adjustments, is scheduled to end on January 1,
2024.
Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value
amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are not offset against fair value
amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty.
Alabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial
derivative transactions and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the
associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2020, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial. Southern
Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative
transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas
may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2020, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin
accounts was $28 million.
The Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The
Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by
Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. The Registrants have also
established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate their exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Southern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including
requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is
most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S.
government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties
an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit
reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when
deemed necessary.(*)

agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash
collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to,
counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables and energy
marketing payables.
The Registrants do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their respective financial statements as a result of counterparty
nonperformance.
15. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
Southern Company
In January 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of all of the capital stock of Gulf Power to a wholly-owned subsidiary of
NextEra Energy, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed),
including the final working capital adjustments. The gain associated with the sale of Gulf Power totaled $2.6 billion pre-tax ($1.4
billion after tax).
In July 2019, PowerSecure completed the sale of its utility infrastructure services business for approximately $65 million, including
the final working capital adjustments. In contemplation of this sale, a goodwill impairment charge of $32 million was recorded in
the second quarter 2019. In December 2019, PowerSecure completed the sale of its lighting business for approximately $9 million,
which included cash of $4 million and a note receivable from the buyer of $5 million. In contemplation of this sale, an impairment
charge of $18 million was recorded in the third quarter 2019 related to goodwill, identifiable intangibles, and other assets.
In December 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of one of its leveraged lease investments for an aggregate cash purchase
price of approximately $20 million. The sale resulted in an immaterial gain.
During the fourth quarter 2020, management of Southern Company initiated steps to sell one of its leveraged leases and classified
the investment in the leveraged lease as held for sale on Southern Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under "Other Matters – Southern Company" and "Assets Held
for Sale" herein for additional information.
Alabama Power
On August 31, 2020, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station, an approximately 885-
MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. The total purchase price was $461 million, of which $452
million was related to net assets recorded within property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet and the remainder primarily
related to inventory, current receivables, and accounts payable. Alabama Power assumed an existing power sales agreement under
which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to another third party for its remaining term of approximately
three years. During the remaining term, the estimated revenues from the power sales agreement are expected to offset the associated
costs of operation. See Notes 2 and 9 under "Alabama Power" and "Lessor," respectively, for additional information.

commercial operation of the facility, which is expected to occur in the first quarter 2021. Subsequent to the acquisition, Southern
Power expects to complete a tax equity transaction. The facility's output is contracted under two long-term PPAs. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Construction Projects
During 2020, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the Reading and Skookumchuck wind facilities,
commenced construction of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, and acquired and commenced
construction of the Glass Sands wind facility. Total aggregate construction costs, excluding acquisition costs, are expected to be
between $392 million and $460 million for the facilities under construction. At December 31, 2020, the total costs of construction
incurred and included in CWIP for these projects were $34 million. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at

(a)In December 2020, Southern Power restructured its ownership of the project by contributing the Class A membership interests to an existing partnership and
selling 100% of the Class B membership interests while retaining the controlling interest. Prior to commercial operation, Southern Power may restructure the
project ownership again and enter into additional partnerships, but expects to retain the controlling interest. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
(b)In December 2020, Southern Power purchased 100% of the membership interests of the Glass Sands facility.
(c)In October 2019, Southern Power purchased 100% of the membership interests of the Skookumchuck facility pursuant to a joint development arrangement. In
November 2020, Southern Power completed a tax equity transaction whereby it received $121 million, resulting in 100% ownership of the Class B membership
interests. Southern Power subsequently sold a noncontrolling interest in the Class B membership interests and now retains the controlling ownership interest in
the facility.
(d)In 2018, Southern Power purchased 100% of the membership interests of the Reading facility pursuant to a joint development arrangement. In June 2020,
Southern Power completed a tax equity transaction whereby it received $156 million and owns 100% of the Class B membership interests.
(e)During 2019, Southern Power also completed the expansion of Plant Mankato, which was sold to a subsidiary of Xcel on January 17, 2020. See "Sales of
Natural Gas and Biomass Plants" below for additional information.
(f)In 2018, Southern Power purchased 100% of the membership interests of the Wildhorse Mountain facility. In December 2019, Southern Power entered into a tax
equity partnership and owns 100% of the Class B membership interests.
Development Projects
Southern Power continues to evaluate and refine the deployment of the remaining wind turbine equipment purchased in 2016 and
2017 to development and construction projects. Wind projects utilizing equipment purchased in 2016 and 2017, and reaching
commercial operation by the end of 2021 and 2022, are expected to qualify for 100% and 80% PTCs, respectively. The significant
majority of this equipment either has been deployed to projects that have been completed, are under construction, or are probable of
completion, or has been sold to third parties. In 2018, as a result of a review of various options for probable dispositions of wind
turbine equipment not deployed to development or construction projects, Southern Power recorded a $36 million asset impairment
charge on the equipment. Gains on equipment sales were immaterial in 2020 and totaled approximately $17 million in 2019.
Sales of Renewable Facility Interests
In May 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership
indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic for approximately $1.2 billion. Since
Southern Power retained control of the limited partnership, the sale was recorded as an equity transaction. On the date of the
transaction, the noncontrolling interest was increased by $511 million to reflect 33% of the carrying value of the partnership. This
difference, partially offset by the tax impact and other related transaction charges, also resulted in a $410 million decrease to
Southern Power's common stockholder's equity.
In December 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, which owns a portfolio
of eight operating wind facilities, to three financial investors for approximately $1.2 billion. The tax equity investors together will
generally receive 40% of the cash distributions from available cash and will receive 99% of the tax attributes, including future
PTCs.
Southern Power consolidates each entity, as the primary beneficiary of the VIE, since it controls the most significant activities,
including operating and maintaining the assets.(a)

In December 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in Plant Oleander and Plant Stanton Unit A
(together, the Florida Plants) to NextEra Energy for $203 million, including final working capital adjustments. In contemplation of
this sale transaction, Southern Power recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $119 million ($89 million after tax) in
the second quarter 2018.
In June 2019, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Nacogdoches, a 115-MW biomass facility located

unit completed in May 2019) to a subsidiary of Xcel for a purchase price of approximately $663 million, including final working
capital adjustments. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $39 million ($23 million after tax). The assets and liabilities of
Plant Mankato were classified as held for sale on Southern Company's and Southern Power's balance sheets at December 31, 2019.
See "Assets Held for Sale" herein for additional information.
Southern Company Gas
Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions
In June 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC for
a total cash purchase price of $365 million, which includes the final working capital adjustment. This disposition resulted in a net
loss of $67 million, which includes $34 million of income tax expense. In contemplation of the transaction, a goodwill impairment
charge of $42 million was recorded during 2018. The income tax expense included tax on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes
and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. Southern Company Gas and American Water Enterprises
LLC entered into a transition services agreement whereby Southern Company Gas provided certain administrative and operational
services, which ended during 2018.
Sales of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas
In July 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural
gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. for a total cash purchase price of $1.7
billion, which includes the final working capital and other adjustments. This disposition resulted in a pre-tax gain that was entirely
offset by $205 million of income tax expense, resulting in no material net income impact. The income tax expense included tax on
goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. Southern
Company Gas and South Jersey Industries, Inc. entered into transition services agreements whereby Southern Company Gas
provided certain administrative and operational services through July 2, 2020.
Sale of Florida City Gas
In July 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal
Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy for a total cash purchase price of $587 million,
which includes the final working capital adjustment. This disposition resulted in a net gain of $16 million, which includes $103
million of income tax expense. The income tax expense included tax on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a
deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. Southern Company Gas and NextEra Energy entered into a transition
services agreement whereby Southern Company Gas provided certain administrative and operational services through July 28,
2020.
Sale of Triton
In May 2019, Southern Company Gas sold its investment in Triton, a cargo container leasing company that was aggregated into
Southern Company Gas' all other segment. This disposition resulted in a pre-tax loss of $6 million and a net after-tax gain of $7
million as a result of reversing a $13 million federal income tax valuation allowance.
Sale of Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline
On March 24, 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline to
Dominion Modular LNG Holdings, Inc. and Dominion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC, respectively, with aggregate proceeds of $178
million, including final working capital adjustments. The loss associated with the transactions was immaterial. Southern Company
Gas also expects to receive payments in April 2021 and August 2021 of $5 million each contingent upon Dominion Modular LNG
Holdings, Inc. meeting certain milestones related to Pivotal LNG. During 2019, based on the terms of these

transactions, Southern Company Gas recorded an asset impairment charge, exclusive of the contingent payments, for Pivotal LNG
of approximately $24 million ($17 million after tax) as of December 31, 2019. The assets and liabilities of Pivotal LNG and the
interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2019. See Note 7 under "Southern Company
Gas" and "Assets Held for Sale" herein for additional information.
Sale of Natural Gas Storage Facility
On December 1, 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of Jefferson Island to EnLink Midstream, LLC for a total
purchase price of $33 million, including estimated working capital adjustments. The gain associated with the sale totaled $22
million pre-tax ($16 million after tax).
Assets Held for Sale
Assets and liabilities held for sale have been classified separately on each company's balance sheet at the lower of carrying value or
fair value less costs to sell at the time the criteria for held-for-sale classification were met. For assets and liabilities held for sale
recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value of assets held for sale is based primarily on unobservable inputs (Level
3), which includes the agreed upon sales prices in executed sales agreements.
Since the depreciation of the assets sold in the Gulf Power transaction and Southern Company Gas' Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas,
and Florida City Gas transactions continued to be reflected in customer rates through the closing date of each sale and was reflected
in the carryover basis of the assets when sold, Southern Company and Southern Company Gas continued to record depreciation on
those assets through the respective closing date of each transaction. Upon classification as held for sale in May 2018 for the Florida
Plants, November 2018 for Plant Mankato, and April 2019 for Plant Nacogdoches, Southern Power ceased recognizing depreciation
and amortization on the long-lived assets being sold.

Power, and Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2020 and/or 2019:

periods presented.

Opinion on the Financial Statement Schedule
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Southern Company Gas and subsidiary companies (Southern Company
Gas) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Southern Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2020, and have issued our report thereon dated February 17, 2021; such report is included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Southern Company Gas (Page S-13)
