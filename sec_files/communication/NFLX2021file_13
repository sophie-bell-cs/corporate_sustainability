Item 1. Business
ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with
approximately 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a
wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected
screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-
mail service in the United States (“U.S.”).
We are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we
have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers
to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing
consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.
Our core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin
target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of
content that delights our members and attracts new members. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and
extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline
viewing.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related
to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our
consolidated financial statements for further detail.
COMPETITION
The market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other
entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), streaming entertainment
providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of
entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment
providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.
While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to
choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of
1
Table of Contents
truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our
technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our original programming.
SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens
and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our
greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and
changes to pricing.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary
technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright
and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights
extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual
property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to
provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights,
including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music
contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to
protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over
rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property
disputes.
REGULATION
The media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been
highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address
services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like
Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can
have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal
reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services
and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offering we may provide.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,400 full-
time employees located globally in 59 countries. Of these, 7,600 (81%) were located in the United States and Canada, 1,000 (11%)
in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 200 (2%) in Latin America and 600 (6%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees
engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year.
We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo"
located on our website, is often described as a high-performance culture of freedom and responsibility. We aim to attract and retain
great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our
employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has the freedom and power to
make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the Company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are
responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun,
stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.
As we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We have also
become mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive
and equitable is a major focus for us. We employ a team reporting to our VP of Inclusion Strategy who works to build diversity,
inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical
lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on
screen - so it’s important that our employees are diverse like the communities we serve. Our Inclusion team helps increase
representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their
networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of
historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. Our ERGs are important in
2
Table of Contents
creating a more inclusive environment for all employees, allowing space to connect on shared experiences, providing mentoring,
career development and volunteering opportunities, and to provide the Company with insight into the perspectives, needs and lived
experiences of the communities. Each ERG is supported by senior leaders across the Company. We published our first Inclusion
report in January 2021 which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion.
    
We believe in fostering great leaders. We employ a VP of Leadership Programs, whose team’s mission is to design programs,
such as seminars and lectures, that help our leaders (officers, VPs and director-level employees) examine values that guide them
personally, and as leaders, especially when those values come into tension with the world around us. The goal of these programs is
to create great human beings, who become great leaders, who shape a great company. We also employ a learning and development
team that programs workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring
teams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to
operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.
    
We aim to pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their
compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of
each employee's individual needs and preferences. In 2020, we conducted a pay equity analysis and adopted practices to ensure that
employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid relative to others doing the same or similar work. We also
practice “open compensation,” which means the top leaders (director-level and above) at the company can see how much any
employee is paid. This encourages open discussions about pay disparities throughout the Company. We aim to rectify any pay gaps
that we find through these approaches.
    
We care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families. Each employee receives an annual cash health
benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. If any portion
of the benefit is unused, the employee is paid the unused benefit as cash compensation, up to $5,000. Employees have access to a
host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations. We
enhanced a number of these benefits to support our employees through the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a
desirable destination for employees.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In
that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business
The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the global attempt to contain it may harm our industry, business,
results of operations and ability to raise additional capital.
The global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the various attempts to contain it have created significant volatility,
uncertainty and economic disruption. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have
enacted various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including orders to close all
businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing. We
anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, including any resurgences, will continue to
negatively impact business activity across the globe. In response to government mandates, health care advisories and otherwise
responding to employee and vendor concerns, we have altered certain aspects of our operations. In an effort to protect the health
and safety of our employees, our workforce has and continues to spend a significant amount of time working from home.
International travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption, as are productions
of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we
use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. While we and our partners have resumed
productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic. To
the extent the resulting economic disruption is severe, we could see some vendors go out of business, resulting in supply constraints
and increased costs or delays to our productions. Such production pauses may cause us temporarily to have less new content
available on our service in subsequent quarters, which could negatively impact consumer demand for and member retention to our
service and the number of paid memberships. Temporary production pauses or permanent shutdowns in production could result in
content asset impairments or other charges and will change the timing and amount of cash outflows associated with production
activity.
The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and
financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration
and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to
the pandemic; the availability and cost to access the capital markets; the effect on our customers and customer demand for and
ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel; and any stoppages,
disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original
programming. During the COVID-19 crisis, we may not be able to provide the same level of customer service and product features
that our members are used to which could negatively impact their perception of our service resulting in an increase in cancellations.
Furthermore, given increased government expenditures associated with their COVID-19 response, we could see increased
government obligations which could negatively impact our results of operations. If we need to access the capital markets, there can
be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised
by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may
be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers,
partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business,
including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.
The COVID-19 pandemic also led to an increase in our net paid membership additions relative to our quarterly forecast and
historic trends in the first half of 2020, and slower net paid membership additions in the second half of 2020 relative to historic
trends. These results, as well as those of other metrics such as revenues, operating margins, net income, net cash provided by
operating activities and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. In addition to the
potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy is likely to be significantly weakened as a result of the actions taken in
response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for
our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our
business and results of operation negatively impacted.

If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.
We have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members
will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, effectively market our
service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series, documentaries and feature films. Furthermore,
the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our
ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming
entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other
sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. If consumers do not perceive our service
offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the
mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We may, from
time to time, adjust our membership pricing or our pricing model itself, which may not be well-received by consumers, and which
may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members
rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing
members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our
business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the
service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a
better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships
both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we permit multiple
users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if
our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of
operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in
nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues
commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If
we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting
new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may
be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new
members.
Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video
offerings, could adversely impact our business.
The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing
distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying
these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture
meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental
proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the
compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video,
including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are
increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong
brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure
better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology,
infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their
services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business
combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with
current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share,
revenues or profitability.
We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or
distribute through our service.
As a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or
other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face
potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward
the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries and feature
films. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and
otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms
of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we
expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and
5
Table of Contents
other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key
talent risk. Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact
timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing
and distribution of our original programming.  We may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these
arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent
behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such
rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such
merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or
discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could
be damaging to our brand or business.
To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does
not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our
business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or
unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types
and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.
If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated
growth in both members and features related to our service, scaling our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to
operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to
address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming
video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and
utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we scale our original content production, we are building out expertise in a
number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the
development and physical production of content. Further, we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received
by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown
liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are
not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational
practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.
If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we
offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.
We believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent
our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to
consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is
deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including
being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened
regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business.
Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not
effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely
impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in
creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.
Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be
adversely affected.
We utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service and
content to existing and potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or
activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing
platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to engage
members and attract new members may be adversely affected.
Companies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions
that in turn negatively impact us. For example, if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar
business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to their marketing channels. We also acquire a
number of members who rejoin our service having previously canceled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or
6
Table of Contents
replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels
and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.
We utilize marketing to promote our content and drive conversation about our content and service. To the extent we promote
our content or service inefficiently or ineffectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our
business may be adversely affected.
We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.
We currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including
TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and
telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers, some of
whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions
by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with
offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for
example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our
relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series, documentaries and feature films to other
platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter
technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via
these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.
Our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely
affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on
terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices
are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance,
the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such
dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our
streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our
service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for
certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.
We are subject to payment processing risk.
Our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards,
prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third
parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations,
including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees.
To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances
of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payments,
loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products,
including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be
adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our
behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to
transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member
acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our
results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we
are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate
may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process
payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.
If government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in
which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.
The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or
otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in
international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in
particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European law enables individual member states
to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction.

We anticipate that several jurisdictions may, over time, impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the
continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which
may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of
existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.
Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net
neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent
network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many
countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws
may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around
these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic
power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth,
cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms
acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.
Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights
holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public
performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses
vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain
content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer
willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely
affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw
content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available
through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase.
As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including
original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient
manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling
mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.
Music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such
distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights
to music and/or other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually
acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing
certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations
between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in
music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach
licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability
for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows,
a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other rights holders could expose us to greater distribution
expenses.
If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our
competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely
affected.
We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees,
consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection
laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal
actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these
applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third
parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or
misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use
or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors
may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the

perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability
to attract members may be adversely affected.
We currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names
could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be
unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or
otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.
Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other
things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes, our
content, and marketing activities.
Trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual
property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use
the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service.
From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis
in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property
rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to
developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means
and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves
against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly
litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website,
streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our
products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the
marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing
agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if
required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.
Risks Related to Information Technology
Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our
operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of
service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property,
including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.
Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of
our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or
interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue
employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in
general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service
interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall
attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.
Our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-
attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems
periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss,
misuse or theft of personal information and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside
parties may attempt to induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data.
Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital
content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our
business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart
hackers and protect our data and systems, but the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly
evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties
we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release
of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service,
systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our
insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting
our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing
monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts

to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our
service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of
memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s
systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and
reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party
provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize
our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films in high volume to
Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers,
including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely
impact the experience of our members.
We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our
use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is
commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data
processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on
AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of
or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail
side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain
competitive advantage against our service, although if it was to do so it could harm our business.
If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and
results of operation could be adversely impacted.
We utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that
we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content
to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery
network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their
networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming
content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected.
Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our
members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to
help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of
third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development
and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired.
Any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely
impact our business.
We rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or
otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that
network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to
their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be
negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or
prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.
Most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel
video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to
our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check
these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or
otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to
which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.

Risks Related to Privacy
Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure
of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation.
In the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to
our members, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data.
We currently face certain regulatory requirements regarding the manner in which we treat such information, including but not
limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and the California
Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA, other data privacy laws or
regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations,
claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs,
penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.
Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and
other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data
utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use
information and other data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose information and other
data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we
could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional
and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws
regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability,
and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional
expenses.
Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data,
particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.
We maintain personal information and other data regarding our members, including names and billing information. This
information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to
billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information.
We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. Despite these measures
we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion
into our members’ information and other data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling
to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators
about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or
other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally,
we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material,
and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information and other data
concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion
into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data and/or production personal information occur, our business
could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.
Risks Related to Liquidity
The long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could
adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
In connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other
content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties,
including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment
terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined
by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent
estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the
accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments,
if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for
certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically
11
Table of Contents
require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of
such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations
could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In
addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to
changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably
received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted
and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering
quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.
We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our
common stockholders.
From time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several
years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may
need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans,
operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and
expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance
of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our
common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively
impact our stock price.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could
adversely affect our financial position.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we
may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If
the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of
December 31, 2020, we had the equivalent of $16.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some
of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that
provides for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, we have not borrowed any amount under
this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $7.0 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on
our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not
include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant.
For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7,
Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,
"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other
obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:
•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on
our Notes and our other obligations;
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business
purposes;
•increase our cost of borrowing;
•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other general business purposes;
•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other
obligations when due;
•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates
and foreign exchange rates.
Our streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in
the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This
could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.
12
Table of Contents
The interest rate of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement makes reference to an adjusted London interbank
offered rate ("LIBO Rate"). It is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Rate will be discontinued as a reference rate. Under our
revolving credit agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate, a mutually agreed-upon alternate benchmark rate
will be established to replace the LIBO Rate.  In the event that an agreement cannot be reached on an appropriate benchmark rate,
the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be adversely impacted.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.
Our ability to make payments on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and
operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and
other factors beyond our control. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative. We may be unable
to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on
our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.
If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a
portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon
the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If
our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these
obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
If our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these
obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital
expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be
able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would
be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations when due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative
measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Risks Related to International Operations
We could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.
Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic,
political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we
face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:
•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;
•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;
•political or social unrest and economic instability;
•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export
controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;
•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including
local ownership requirements for streaming content providers;
•regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or
purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or
particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;
•foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, which may be less
favorable than U.S. law and, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-
piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;
•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related
application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax
liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against
and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange
rate risk;
•profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;
13
Table of Contents
•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as
payment cards;
•new and different sources of competition;
•censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand
tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service;
•low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;
•different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or
restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements;
•availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;
•differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;
•negative impacts from trade disputes; and
•implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and
preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support
local film funds. For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require
that European works comprise at least thirty (30) percent of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence
of those works.
Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and
results of our operations.
We are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment
is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions
on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct
our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant
impact on our global provision for income taxes.
Tax laws are being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for
financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax
positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. Many U.S. states, countries in the European Union,
as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are
actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do
business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business,
financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
Risks Related to Human Resources
We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.
We rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Reed Hastings and
Ted Sarandos, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry,
there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other
personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating
existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be
disrupted.
Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.
Our partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade
employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and
internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring
collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of
strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective
bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production,
added costs or by reducing profit margins.

Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider
favorable.
Our charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable
because they:
•authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred
stock;
•provide for a classified board of directors;
•prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;
•establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and
•prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a
corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has
held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors
could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
In addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our
Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.
Our stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a
number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:
•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net
income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;
•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial
community;
•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;
•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;
•market volatility in general;
•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;
•the impact of any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;
•the operating results of our competitors; and
•other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.
As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their
original purchase price.
Following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We
may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and
a diversion of management’s attention and resources.
Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially
from actual results.
 Given the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues,
operating margins, net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ
materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other
15
Table of Contents
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For
example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or
produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing
patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and
could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period
expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively
impact our stock price.
General Risk Factors
We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant
amount of our management's time and attention.
From time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial
position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included
copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well
as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to
incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our
management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from
time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may
become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations,
inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming
and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our
business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business
operations and financial position.

Operating income $4,585,289 $2,604,254 $1,605,226 76 %
Operating margin 18 % 13 % 10 % 38 %
Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 24% as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019. The increase in our consolidated revenues was due to the 24% growth in average paying memberships and a 1% increase in
average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from
our price changes and plan mix, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership
additions for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 31% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of
the long term trend toward streaming on demand entertainment and due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social restrictions
and local government mandates of home confinement in certain jurisdictions.
The increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues and decreased marketing costs, coupled with cost of
revenues, technology and development, and general and administrative costs growing at a slower rate as compared to the 24%
increase in revenues.
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on
numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: "Risk Factors" section set forth in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce
has had and continues in most instances to spend a significant amount of time working from home, international travel has been
severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption, as are the productions of our third-party content
suppliers. Our other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations
as well as development, production, and post-production of content. While we and our partners have resumed productions and
related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic. In an effort to
contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have also enacted various measures, some of which have
been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate
residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing. We anticipate that these actions and the global health
crisis caused by COVID-19, including any resurgences, will continue to negatively impact business activity across the globe. We
will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by
federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers,
22
Table of Contents
partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business,
including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.
Streaming Revenues
    
We derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a
variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2020,
pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $24 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of
our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.
The following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

(1) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix
service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions
that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the

Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s
internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.
(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying
membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying
membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange
rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues would
have been approximately $596 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended
December 31, 2019.
Cost of Revenues
Amortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing
and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included
in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery
costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network
(“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses,
therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such
as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and
payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our
content available to members.

As a percentage of revenues 61 % 62 % 63 %
The increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
was primarily due to a $1,591 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, including more
exclusive and original programming. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content increased
$1,101 million, primarily due to expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic and continued growth in our content production
activities. Streaming delivery costs and other operations costs increased driven by our growing member base.
Marketing
Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including
consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include
24

promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for
personnel that support marketing activities.

The decrease in marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
was primarily due to a $432 million decrease in advertising expenses, partially offset by increased payments to our marketing
partners.
Technology and Development
Technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for all technology personnel, as well as other
costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface,
our recommendations, merchandising and streaming delivery technology and infrastructure. Technology and development expenses
also include costs associated with computer hardware and software.

The increase in technology and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a $254 million increase in personnel-related costs, including increases in compensation
for existing employees and growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued
improvements in our streaming service.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for corporate personnel. General and
administrative expenses also include professional fees and other general corporate expenses.

The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a $128 million increase in personnel-related costs, including increases in compensation
for existing employees and growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued
improvements in our streaming service.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations, including the amortization
of debt issuance costs. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item
8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on our debt obligations.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of $749 million of interest on our Notes. The
increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is due to the
increase in debt.
Interest and Other Income (Expense)
Interest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated
balances and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.

Interest and other income (expense) decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $660 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to a gain of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The foreign exchange loss in the
year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the non-cash $533 million loss from the remeasurement of our Senior
Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the
functional currencies.

As of December 31, 2020, we had a California research and development ("R&D") credit carryforward of $250 million,
which can be carried forward indefinitely. On June 29, 2020, California enacted legislative changes that impose an annual cap of $5
million on the amount of business incentive tax credits we can utilize in California effective for tax years 2020 through 2022. As a
result, we evaluated our ability to realize the California R&D credit, and considered all available positive and negative evidence,
including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income and determined it is more likely than not
that the pre-2020 credits and a portion of the current year R&D credit would not be realized. In the twelve months ended December
31, 2020 we recorded a valuation allowance of $250 million. We will monitor our business strategies, weighing positive and
negative evidence in assessing the realization of this asset in the future and in the event there is a need to release the valuation
allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded.
The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019 is primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the California R&D credit, partially offset by the recognition
of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation.
In 2020, the difference between our 14% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the
recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation and Federal and California R&D credits, partially offset by the
establishment of a valuation allowance on the California R&D credit.

Short-term and long-term debt 16,308,973 14,759,260 1,549,713 10 %
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $3,195 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to
cash provided by operations coupled with the issuance of debt.
Debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $1,550 million primarily due to the issuance of debt in April 2020 coupled with the
remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes. The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,264
million. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts had been borrowed under our $750 million Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note
6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.
As our cash provided by operating activities improved in 2020, we anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt
market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to,
or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the
condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to
us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.
As our cash provided by operating activities grows and exceeds our minimum cash needs, our future capital allocation may
include stock repurchase programs. The timing and magnitude of such programs will depend on, among other things, our
development efforts, business plans and operating performance.
Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs
and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization
period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to
licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available
on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in
original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and
access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least
the next twelve months.
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and
change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the
amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain
other activities like share repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in
isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other
measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major
recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash
remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include
deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our
outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.

While we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce
content remains affected by the pandemic. As a result, the timing of certain production payments has been and will continue to be
delayed until productions can resume and may be shifted to future years. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $5,314
million from the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2,427 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by a
$4,840 million or 24% increase in revenues coupled with a decrease in cash payments for content assets. The payments for content
assets decreased $2,074 million, from $14,611 million to $12,537 million, or 14%, as compared to the increase in the amortization
of content assets of $1,591 million, from $9,216 million to $10,807 million, or 17%. In addition, we had increased payments
associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our
streaming service and our international expansion.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $118 million, primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and
equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $3,268 million primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the
issuance of debt of $3,431 million from $4,433 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1,002 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $163 million.
Free cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730
million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital
differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-
cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance for deferred taxes due to recent
legislation which imposed an annual cap on research and development credits.
Free cash flow was $5,141 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to
$5,394 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense, $46 million non-cash
remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt, and $106 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially
offset by $405 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
Contractual Obligations
For the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are
enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased;
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of
the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2020. Timing of payments
and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts
for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:

(1)As of December 31, 2020, content obligations were comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and
$2.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $12.2 billion of obligations that are
not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.
Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the
production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other
production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter
into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity
and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series
license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The
contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for
which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be
significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments
for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on
considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the
license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.
(2)Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying
notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
(3)See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details
regarding leases. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet
commenced of $256 million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December 31, 2020 increased
$82 million from $2,757 million as of December 31, 2019 to $2,839 million as of December 31, 2020 due to growth in
facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.
(4)Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to
streaming delivery and cloud computing costs, as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not
received the related services or goods.
As of December 31, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $140 million, of which $38 million was classified in
“Other non-current liabilities” and $54 million as a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current
assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance
of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special
purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent
arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in
an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.

Indemnifications

on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s
critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of
operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have
identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Content
We acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of
video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content
licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for
content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used
in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
We recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as "Content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For
licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the
license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we
capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations
and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced)
in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of
availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an
accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts,
and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content
asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the
amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management
judgment.
Our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets
(licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or
change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than
unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the
future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs
for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.
Income Taxes
We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the
asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as
well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if
necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.
Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of
tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated
financial statements.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative
evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent
30
Table of Contents
and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment
and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future
years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that
most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of
December 31, 2020 the valuation allowance of $250 million was related to the California research and development credits that we
do not expect to realize.
We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may
recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December 31,
2020, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $140 million of which $86 million, if recognized, would favorably
impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our
unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.
See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt
and foreign currency fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
At December 31, 2020, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds
fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $16.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in sixteen tranches due
between 2021 and 2030. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of
our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods
of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed
below.
Foreign Currency Risk
Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar account for 54% of the consolidated amount for the year ended
December 31, 2020. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British
pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may
negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our
revenues would have been approximately $596 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those
for the year ended December 31, 2019.
We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the
settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency.
In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $660 million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the non-cash
remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions
denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.
In addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2020 was an
increase of $36 million.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange
rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of
operations.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures.
Our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.
 
(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on
our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.
 
(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated January 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019
due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The
communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Table of Contents
Content Amortization
Description of the Matter As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “Organization and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies”, the Company acquires, licenses and produces content,
including original programming (“Content”). The Company amortizes Content based on factors
including historical and estimated viewing patterns.
Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the
judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns.
Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing
patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed
and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.
How We Addressed the
Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of
controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over
management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions,
including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated
viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the
model was complete and accurate.
To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content
amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing
patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we
assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current
operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual
results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content
amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is
one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying
TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they
want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without
commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States ("U.S.").
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content
asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), in order to improve financial reporting of expected credit losses on financial
instruments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit
losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in prior GAAP with a
methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. The Company adopted ASU
2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 and the impact of the adoption was not material to the Company's consolidated financial
statements as credit losses are not expected to be significant based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of
payment partners, and external market factors.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2019-12
removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating
income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up
in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. ASU 2019-12 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the
potential impacts of ASU 2019-12, it does not expect ASU 2019-12 to have a material effect, if any, on its financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash
equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card
transactions as cash equivalents.
Content
The Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited
viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.
47
Table of Contents
Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the
amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are
classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the
liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For
produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and
production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and
produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window
of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an
accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and
marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or
produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews
factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors
require considerable management judgment.
The Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.
Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group
level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value
may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such
changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In
addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term
for leasehold improvements, if applicable.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the
Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends,
the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.
Marketing
Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners,
including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile operators
and internet service providers ("ISPs"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television
advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,447 million, $1,879 million and $1,808
million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related
expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service
offerings. Research and development expenses were $1,984 million, $1,673 million and $1,218 million for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
48
Table of Contents
Income Taxes
The Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations
using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced,
if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.
The Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The
Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 to the
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which
the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated
using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative
translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
The Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange
rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income
(expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $660 million, a gain of $7 million, and a loss of $1 million for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash
remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions
denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants fully vested non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate
vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option
forfeitures. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.
2.Revenue Recognition
The Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of
their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net
of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its
relationships where partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, provide access to the service as the
Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are
expensed. However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the
member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these
payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.
The following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions, and ending paid memberships by region

A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service
following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may
be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics
as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership
period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are
assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems,
which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.

Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid
memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2020, total deferred revenue was $1,118 million, the vast
majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The
remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue
over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $193 million increase in
deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $925 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, is a result of the increase in
membership fees billed due to increased memberships.
3.Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and,
when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares
issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as follows:

Leases
The Company has entered into operating leases primarily for real estate. These leases generally have terms which range from
1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20
years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating
leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s
right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are included in "Accrued
expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Operating lease
right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the
lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases, primarily for marketing billboards, with an initial
term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized
approximately $441 million in total lease costs, which was comprised of $324 million in operating lease costs for right-of-use
assets and $117 million in short-term lease costs related to short-term operating leases. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the
Company recognized approximately $448 million in total lease costs, which was comprised of $218 million in operating lease costs
for right-of-use assets and $230 million in short-term lease costs related to short-term operating leases.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized minimum rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company used the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally
when the Company entered the space and began to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent
escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the
Company recorded minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Rent expense associated with operating leases was $107 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to
determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate and marketing which may
contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.

6.Debt
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had aggregate outstanding notes of $16,309 million, net of $107 million of issuance
costs, with varying maturities (the "Notes"). Of the outstanding balance, $500 million, net of issuance costs, is classified as short-
term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had aggregate outstanding long-term notes
of $14,759 million, net of $114 million of issuance costs. Each of the Notes were issued at par and are senior unsecured obligations
of the Company. Interest is payable semi-annually at fixed rates. A portion of the outstanding Notes is denominated in foreign
currency (comprised of €5,170 million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement loss
totaling $533 million for the year ended December 31, 2020).

Each of the Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders, at
a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity
in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium.
The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company's ability to create, incur or allow certain liens;
enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company's
subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries
assets, to another person. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all related
covenants.
Revolving Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit
Agreement”), which matures on March 29, 2024. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until March 29, 2024,
at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts have been borrowed
under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate
equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted
LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of 0.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the
Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus 0.500% and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate
for a one-month interest period, plus 1.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits
in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO
Rate be less than 0.00% per annum. Regulatory authorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of
2021, they would no longer compel banks currently reporting information used to set the LIBO Rate to continue to make rate
submissions. As a result, it is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Rate will no longer be available as a reference rate. Under
the terms of the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate, a mutually agreed-
upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate. The Company and Lenders shall in good faith establish
an alternate benchmark rate which places the Lenders and the Company in the same economic position that existed immediately
prior to the discontinuation of the LIBO Rate. The Company does not anticipate that the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate will
materially impact its liquidity or financial position.
The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an
annual rate of 0.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including
covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the
Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a
guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company was in
compliance with all related covenants.
7.Commitments and Contingencies
Content
At December 31, 2020, the Company had $19.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content
liabilities" and $2.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $12.2 billion of obligations
that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had $19.5 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content
liabilities" and $3.3 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $11.8 billion of obligations
that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.
The expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:

Due after 5 years 445,308 618,644 
Total content obligations $19,218,830 $19,490,082 
    
Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in
non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes
non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments.
An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain
future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements
include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet
determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of
seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation
for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including
claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to
normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of
these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as
incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse
effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
The Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either
individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation
and events related thereto unfold.
8.Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to
provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including,
but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement
claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract.
The Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the
Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification
agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain
liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each
particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these
indemnification guarantees.

9. Stockholders’ Equity
Voting Rights
The holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the
Company’s stockholders.
Stock Option Plan
On June 4, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved the 2020 Stock Plan, which was adopted by the Company's Board of
Directors on March 4, 2020 subject to stockholder approval. The 2020 Stock Plan is the successor to the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2020
Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock

The aggregate intrinsic value of the Company's outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2020 was $6,922 million and
represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2020
and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had
all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2020. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was
$1,596 million, $666 million and $863 million, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the Company's
outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2020 included in the table above was 5.55 years.
Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $235 million, $72 million
and $125 million, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation
Stock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status. The following
table summarizes the assumptions used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data:
 
 Year Ended December 31,
 2020 2019 2018
Dividend yield — % — % — %
Expected volatility 37% - 45% 37% - 41% 40% - 42%

Suboptimal exercise factor 3.34 - 3.67 3.07 - 3.23 2.80 - 3.01
Valuation data:
Weighted-average fair value (per share) $ 217.42 $ 156.60 $ 157.19 
Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) 415,180 405,376 320,657 
Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands) 91,718 90,856 67,575 
The Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated
option exercise behavior.
The Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility
of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes
of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common
stock.
In valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on
U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation
model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a California research and development ("R&D") credit carryforward of
$250 million which can be carried forward indefinitely. On June 29, 2020, California enacted legislative changes that impose an
annual cap of $5 million on the amount of business incentive tax credits we can utilize in California effective for tax years 2020
through 2022. As a result, we evaluated the Company's ability to realize the California R&D credit, the Company considered all
available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income
and determined it is more likely than not that the pre-2020 credits and a portion of the current year R&D credit would not be
realized. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $250 million. The
Company will monitor its business strategies, weighing positive and negative evidence in assessing its realization of this asset in
the future and in the event there is a need to release the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded.
A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax

Valuation allowance (249,844) (134,782)
Net deferred tax assets $ 589,091 $ 658,206 
All deferred tax assets are classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31,
2020 and December 31, 2019. In evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available
positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings,
future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2020, the valuation allowance of $250
million was related to the California R&D credits that the Company does not expect to realize.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Federal R&D tax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes
were $317 million, and $365 million, respectively. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2040. State tax credit
carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company determined that the likelihood of utilizing its non-U.S. foreign tax credits of
$135 million for which there was a valuation allowance of $135 million was remote given its recent global corporate simplification.
As such, the Company has written off the deferred tax asset against the valuation allowance and will no longer disclose these
amounts.
The unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as
“Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $140 million, of
which $86 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2019, the total
amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $67 million, of which $57 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the
Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are
summarized as follows (in thousands):

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in
“Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for
income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.
The Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for
2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019. The 2015 through 2019 state tax returns are subject to examination by
various state tax authorities. The Company is also currently under examination in the UK for 2018 and 2019. The company has no
other significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2014 through 2019 generally remain subject to examination by
foreign tax authorities.
Given the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential
expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly
change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this
time.
11.    Employee Benefit Plan
The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute
up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue
Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s
matching contributions totaled $69 million, $47 million and $27 million, respectively.
Multiemployer Benefit Plans
The Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining
agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different
from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to
provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the
multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii)
if the Company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the
obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans
that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any
multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.
The following table summarizes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively:

The Company operates as one operating segment. The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is its co-chief
executive officers, who review financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions,
assessing financial performance and allocating resources.
