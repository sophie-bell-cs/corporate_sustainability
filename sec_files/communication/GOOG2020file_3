$680.0 billion. For purposes of calculating the aggregate market value of shares held by non-aﬃliates, we have
assumed that all outstanding shares are held by non-aﬃliates, except for shares held by each of our executive
oﬃcers, directors and 5% or greater stockholders. In the case of 5% or greater stockholders, we have not deemed
such stockholders to be aﬃliates unless there are facts and circumstances which would indicate that such
stockholders exercise any control over our company, or unless they hold 10% or more of our outstanding common
stock. These assumptions should not be deemed to constitute an admission that all executive oﬃcers, directors and
5% or greater stockholders are, in fact, aﬃliates of our company, or that there are not other persons who may be
deemed to be aﬃliates of our company. Further information concerning shareholdings of our oﬃcers, directors and
principal stockholders is included or incorporated by reference in Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

December 31, 2018 as ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2019 (the “Original Form
