Item 1. Business
ABOUT US
Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading internet entertainment service with over 139
million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres
and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play,
pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, over two million members in the United States
("U.S.") subscribe to our legacy DVD-by-mail service.
We are a pioneer in the internet delivery of TV series and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch,
we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable
consumers to enjoy TV series and movies directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have
experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV series and movies directly over the internet.
Our core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin
target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a
programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our
user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of
titles for offline viewing.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic
streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to members in the
United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to
streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly
membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail.
COMPETITION
The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other
entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), internet-based content providers
(including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD retailers and more broadly against other sources of
entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers
and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.
While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to
choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of
1
Table of Contents
truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our
technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original programming.
SEASONALITY
Our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens
and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our
greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International streaming segments. Our membership growth can sometimes be
impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content. Within our International streaming segment, we expect each market
to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a
longer history to assess such patterns.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary
technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and
trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce
our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations
concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 7,100 full-time employees, of which approximately 6,900 supported our
streaming segments.
OTHER INFORMATION
We were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal
executive offices are located at 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, California 95032, and our telephone number is (408) 540-3700.
We maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as
part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Netflix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and
the “registrant” refer to Netflix, Inc. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably
practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Investors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations
website (http://ir.netflix.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as
social media to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that
the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media,
and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations
website.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In
that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business
If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.
We have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members
will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality
experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and
related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors
include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that
provide pirated content) and DVD retailers. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we
introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not
favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service
or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not
successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be
adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service
sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value
or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace
canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If we do not grow as expected, given, in
particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our
expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins,
liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new
competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.
Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing
expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.
Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video
offerings, could adversely impact our business.
The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing
distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying
these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture
meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental
proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the
compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video,
including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are
increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases,
strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may
secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology,
infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their
services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business
combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with
current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share,
revenues or profitability.
The long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely
affect our liquidity and results of operations.
In connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content
providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including
elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of
these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of
production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable
under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II,
3
Table of Contents
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5, Commitments and
Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of
content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely
impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front
cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the
extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely
affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term
and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business
and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a
territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and
fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation
may be adversely impacted.
We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or
distribute through our service.
As a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or
other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face
potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward
the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies. We believe that
original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain
members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and
popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original
programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take
on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment
industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract
with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.  We may face
potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties
violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital
merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product
liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not
to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content
might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand or business.
To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does
not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our
business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or
unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types
and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.
If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms
acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.
Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders
licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained
within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. As content providers
develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series
or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content
upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase.
Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively
quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn
on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we
are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also
focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are
selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership
acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.
Music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such
distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain
4
Table of Contents
rights to music and/or other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach
mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from
distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as
negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with
CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our
ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to
potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution
of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors and performers could expose us to greater distribution
expenses.
If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated
growth in both members and features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as
continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our
business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and
internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing
technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building
out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources
related to the development and physical production of content. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our
business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and
original content, our business may be adversely affected.
We could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.
Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic,
political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we
face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:
•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;
•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;
•political or social unrest and economic instability;
•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export
controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;
•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;
•regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or
purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or
particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;
•foreign intellectual property laws, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, among other
issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit
intellectual property rights;
•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related
application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax
liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against
and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange
rate risk;
•profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as
payment cards;
•new and different sources of competition;
•censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or
dissatisfaction with our service;
•low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;
5
Table of Contents
•different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization
requirements;
•availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;
•integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may
acquire or control;
•differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy; and
•implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and
preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support
local film funds.
Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and
results of our operations.
We are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment
is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions
on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct
our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a
significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.
Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied.
The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition,
governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as
well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are
actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do
business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business,
financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
If we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we
offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.
We believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent
our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to
consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is
deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including
being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened
regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. Furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public
relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may
likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we
are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.
Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be
adversely affected.
We utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service to
potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates
increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or
damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new members may be adversely
affected.
Companies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that
in turn negatively impact us. For example, if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or
exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to their marketing channels. We also acquire a number of
members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or replace our sources
of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing
expenses may be adversely affected.
6
Table of Contents
We utilize marketing to promote our content and drive viewing by our members. To the extent we promote our content
inefficiently or ineffectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely
affected.
We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.
We currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including
TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and
telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers. In many
instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise
offers services or products in connection with offering our service. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing
partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not
successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory,
business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members
and grow our business could be adversely impacted.
Our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely
affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on
terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices
are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance,
the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such
dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our
streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices,
our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.
Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our
operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of
service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property,
including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.
Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of
our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or
interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications
failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable
or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errors in
our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our
membership service to existing and potential members.
Our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-
attacks, both from state-sponsored and individual activity, such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic
break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and
delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data, confidential information or intellectual property.
Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information
in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or
intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties
we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain
systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, but techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data
and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Because of our
prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have
experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a
material impact on our service or systems. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or
systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent
hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These
efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more
sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant
disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results
of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal
information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party
Web hosting provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We
also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series and movies in high volume to Netflix
members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting, “cloud” computing, or other network providers,
including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely
impact the experience of our members.
We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our
use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is
commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data
processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS.
Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or
interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side
of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive
advantage against our service, although if it was to do so it could harm our business.
If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and
results of operation could be adversely impacted.
We utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that
we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content
to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery
network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN, or if we experience
difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be
adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and
merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and
retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and
otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or
otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software, our ability to
operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ personal
computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
If government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in
which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.
The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or
otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in
international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in
particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European law enables individual member states
to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. In addition, the continued
growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may
impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing
regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.
Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net
neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent
network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many
countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws
may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around
these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic
power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth,
cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.

Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely
impact our business.
We rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or
otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that
network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to
their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be
negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or
prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.
Most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel
video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to
our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check
these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or
otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to
which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.
Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data
could adversely impact our business and reputation.
In the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to
our members, we collect and utilize data supplied by our members. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner
in which we treat such information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data
Protection Regulation or “GDPR”). Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts
to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits.
Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to
collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our
members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face
potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more
stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data
localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent
that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.
Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data, particularly billing data, were to
be accessed by unauthorized persons.
We maintain personal data regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own
systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on
encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion
into our members’ data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as
AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential
members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may
be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including the EU Lead Data Protection Authority) as well
as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory
fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance
against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain employment and personal information concerning our employees, as well as
personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ data
occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively
impacted.
We are subject to payment processing risk.
Our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards,
prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third
parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and
require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the
payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes
to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment
processing systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating
expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we
9
Table of Contents
leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling
or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative
methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we
encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and
managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable
levels, card networks may impose fines and our card approval rate may be impacted. The termination of our ability to process
payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.
If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our
competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely
affected.
We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees,
consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection
laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal
actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these
applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third
parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or
misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use
or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors
may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to
members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely
affected.
We currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names
could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be
unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or
otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.
Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other
things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and
marketing activities.
Trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual
property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our our service. We
use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service.
From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis
in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property
rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to
developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means
and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves
against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation
and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming
technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We
may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a
result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our
content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly
or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.
We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount
of our management's time and attention.
From time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial
position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included
copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, employment related litigation, as well as consumer
and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen
expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time
and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We
10
Table of Contents
also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we
may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of
investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive,
time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things,
modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect
our business operations and financial position.
We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our
common stockholders.
From time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. Our cash
flows provided by our operating activities have been negative in each of the last four years, primarily as a result of our decision to
increase the amount of original streaming content available on our service. To the extent our cash flows from operations continue to
be negative, we anticipate seeking additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things,
our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of
equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our
common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively
impact our stock price.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could
adversely affect our financial position.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we
expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming
content obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had $10.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding
(“Notes”). In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $500 million unsecured revolving
credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31,
2018, we had approximately $8.4 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount does
not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are
significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see
Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II,
Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and
other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:
•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on
our Notes and our other obligations;
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business
purposes;
•increase our cost of borrowing;
•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other general business purposes;
•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other
obligations when due;
•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates.
Our streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in
the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This
could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.
Our ability to make payments on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and
operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business
11
Table of Contents
and other factors beyond our control. In each of the last four years, our cash flows from operating activities have been negative. We
may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.
If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a
portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon
the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If
our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these
obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
If our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these
obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital
expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be
able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would
be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures,
our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.
We rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed
Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there
is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We may
not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel, which may be disruptive to our
operations.
Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.
Our partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade
employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and
internationally. If expiring collective bargaining agreements can not be renewed then it is possible that the affected unions could
take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective
bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production
or by reducing profit margins.
Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider
favorable.
Our charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable
because they:
•authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred
stock;
•provide for a classified board of directors;
•prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;
•establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and
•prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a
corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has
held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors
could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
In addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our
Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.

Our stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a
number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:
•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net
income and free cash flow;
•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial
community;
•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;
•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;
•market volatility in general;
•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and
•the operating results of our competitors.
As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their
original purchase price.
Following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We
may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and
a diversion of management’s attention and resources.
Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially
from actual results.
 Given the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues,
operating margins, net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ
materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the
amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie
based upon factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-
period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could
negatively impact our stock price.

Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters are located in Los Gatos, California and consist of leased space aggregating approximately
600,000 square feet. Additionally, our Los Angeles, California offices consist of leased space aggregating approximately 400,000
square feet. We have entered into leases for additional space that will add approximately 700,000 square feet to the Los Angeles,
California offices to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions. The additional space is estimated
to be available for use over the next two years.
In the United States, we lease other offices in various locations, including Fremont, California for our DVD operations. We
also lease office space in other countries to support international streaming operations.
We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute
space will be available as needed to accommodate any further physical expansion of operations and for any additional offices.

A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service
following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or other promotional offering by the
Company to certain new and rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of
the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period.
Involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately. Memberships are
assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems,
which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.

Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 35%, including an increase of 24% and 53% in
revenues in the Domestic streaming and International streaming segments, respectively, as compared to the year ended December
31, 2017. International revenues accounted for 50% of total streaming revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared
to 45% of total streaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily
driven by the growth in the average number of streaming paid memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our
international memberships. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 55% of total average streaming paid
memberships as of December 31, 2018, as compared to 49% of total average streaming paid memberships as of December 31,
2017. In addition, average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership increased primarily due to price changes and a shift
in the plan mix towards higher priced plans. The growth in paid net membership additions has been less volatile when compared to
growth in total net membership additions as a result of free trial variability. We therefore believe paid memberships is a more
reliable indicator of revenue growth.
The increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by increased content expenses as we
continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing expenses and
headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion, and our growing content
production activities.
We offer three main types of streaming membership plans. Our "basic" plan includes access to standard definition quality
streaming on a single screen at a time. Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition
quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium" plan includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition
quality content on four screens concurrently. As of December 31, 2018, pricing on our plans ranged in the U.S. from $7.99 to
$13.99 per month and internationally from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3 to $20 per month. We expect that from
time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may increase and we may occasionally test other plan and price
variations.
The following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:
•We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment.
This represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs. As markets within our International streaming
segment become profitable, we increasingly focus on our global operating profit margin target as a measure of
profitability.
•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, amortization of the streaming content assets makes up the
majority of cost of revenues. Increasingly, we obtain multi-territory or global rights for our streaming content and allocate
these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value.

Table of Contents
Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content (such as payroll and related
personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent,
miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations
costs, make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ("Open
Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming delivery
expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-
party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet. Other operations
costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as
well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.
•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and
certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile
operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising.
Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing
activities. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments in order to build
consumer awareness of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content.

Year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
In the Domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming
content to our members in the United States. The 24% increase in our domestic streaming revenues was primarily due to the 11%
growth in the average number of paid memberships, as well as a 12% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership,
resulting from our price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans. Our standard plan continues to be the most
popular plan choice for new memberships.
The increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $358 million increase in content amortization
relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $210
million primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content as well
as increased payment processing fees driven by our growing member base.
Domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising, driven by increased investments in
marketing of new original titles. The increase in marketing expenses is also attributable to increased public relations spending and
payments to our partners.

Year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
In the International streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming
content to our members outside the United States. The 53% increase in our international revenues was due to the 40% growth in the
average number of paid international memberships, in addition to a 9% increase in average monthly revenue per paying
membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix
towards higher priced plans, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international
revenues would have been approximately $94 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2018 if foreign exchange rates had
remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2017. If foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than
expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations.
The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $976 million increase in content amortization relating to
our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $440 million
primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content, coupled with
increases in payment processing fees and streaming delivery expenses, which were driven by our growing member base.
International marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased advertising, driven by increased investments in
marketing of new original titles. The increase in marketing expenses is also attributable to increased payments to our partners.

In the Domestic DVD segment, we derive revenues from our DVD-by-mail membership services. We offer various DVD-by-
mail plans that differ by the number of DVDs that a member may have out at any given point and access to high definition Blu-ray
discs in addition to standard definition DVDs. Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of delivery
expenses such as packaging and postage costs, content expenses, and other expenses associated with our DVD processing and
customer service centers. The number of memberships to our DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline
will continue.

Interest and other income (expense) increased primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses. The foreign exchange loss of $1
million in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in
currencies other than the functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities, mostly offset by the $74 million gain from
remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros.

Year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
The increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to lower benefit on a percentage basis from the recognition of excess tax
benefits of stock-based compensation as well as additional expense related to foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses and the
international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. In 2018, the difference between our 1% effective tax
rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation,
Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), and updated adjustments related to U.S. tax reform as a result of
the U.S. federal tax return filing, partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses and the international
provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the
Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax
years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial
system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31,
2017. In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the
period in which the legislation was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million
related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB
118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information
available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax
effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we have
completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118
tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to
the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
At the beginning of 2017, we underwent a corporate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our
business operates. As a result of this restructuring and our increasing international income, there is now significantly more income
being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate.
The decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of
ASU 2016-09 and an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In 2017, the difference between
our (15)% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $(244) million primarily due to the recognition of excess tax
benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory
rate and Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), partially offset by state taxes and non-deductible
expenses as well as the provisional impact of changes to tax law.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the
Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax
years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial
system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31,
2017. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our
understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $79 million as additional
income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to
the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the
future, was $47 million. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of
foreign earnings was $32 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $485 million. We also recorded a $67 million benefit
related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit. We have determined there is
sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 3,812,041 $ 2,822,795
Long-term debt 10,360,058 6,499,432
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $989 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the
issuance of debt, partially offset by cash used in operations.
Long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $3,861 million due to long-term note issuances of $1,900 million in
April 2018 and $800 million and €1,100 million in October 2018. The earliest maturity date for our outstanding long-term debt is
February 2021. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts had been borrowed under our $500 million revolving credit facility. See Note
4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to finance our
future capital needs in the debt market, as we continue to believe that our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity. Our
ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our
development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.
We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of
equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and
our stockholders may experience dilution.
Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs
and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization
period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to
licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available
on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content,
particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years. We
currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit
facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash
flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric
because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make
investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming
content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute
for, net income, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity
presented in accordance with GAAP.
In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three
major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other
working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our
outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.

Year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017
Net cash used in operating activities increased $895 million to $2,680 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The
increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments,
partially offset by a $4,102 million or 35% increase in revenues. The payments for streaming content assets increased $3,138
million, from $8,906 million to $12,044 million, or 35%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets
of $1,334 million, from $6,198 million to $7,532 million, or 22%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher
operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our
international expansion and increased content production activities.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $373 million, primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the sale of short-
term investments, net of purchases, of $268 million. In July 2017, the Company sold all short-term investments. In addition, the
cash used to purchase other assets increased $120 million primarily driven by the acquisition of intangible assets in the year ended
December 31, 2018.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $972 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt
of $938 million from $2,988 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $3,926 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.
In addition, we had an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $36 million.
Non-GAAP free cash flow was $4,231 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to
$4,512 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $40 million in other non-
favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $321 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
Year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016
Net cash used in operating activities increased $312 million to $1,786 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments,
partially offset by a $2,862 million or 32% increase in revenues. The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,025
million, from $6,881 million to $8,906 million, or 29%, as compared to an increase in the amortization of streaming content assets
of $1,409 million, from $4,788 million to $6,198 million, or 29%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher
operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service,
our international expansion and increased content production activities. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,862
million or 32% increase in revenues.
Net cash provided by investing activities decreased $15 million, primarily due to a $66 million increase in the purchases of
property and equipment, largely due to the expansion of our Los Gatos, California headquarters, as well as our new office space in
Los Angeles, California. This increase in cash used was partially offset by an increase of $33 million in the proceeds from sales and
maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases due to the sale of our short-term investments in July 2017 as well as a decline
in DVD purchases of $24 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $1,985 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt
of $1,999 million from $989 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2,988 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Table of Contents
Non-GAAP free cash flow was $2,579 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to
$2,708 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $53 million of unfavorable
other working capital differences, partially offset by $182 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
Contractual Obligations
For the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are
enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased;
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of
the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2018. Timing of payments
and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts
for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018:

Total  $36,563,586 $ 9,713,277 $10,918,426$ 3,696,622$12,235,261
 
(1)As of December 31, 2018, streaming content obligations were comprised of $4.7 billion included in "Current content
liabilities" and $3.8 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $10.8 billion of
obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.
Streaming content obligations increased $1.6 billion from $17.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 to $19.3 billion as of
December 31, 2018 primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and
original programming.
Streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An
obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment
agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred
at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the
ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or
certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of
agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles,
payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are
expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $2 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with
the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is
based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will
receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.
 
(2)Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in
the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
(3)Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $11 million related to certain of our Los Gatos, California corporate
offices for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $1,157 million for our office space in
Los Gatos, California and in Los Angeles, California and other commitments of $540 million for corporate and production
facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2034.
Total lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 increased $971 million from $737 million
28
Table of Contents
as of December 31, 2017 to $1,708 million as of December 31, 2018 due to growth in facilities to support our growing
headcount and growing number of original productions.
(4)Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to
streaming delivery and cloud computing costs, as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not
received the related services or goods.
As of December 31, 2018, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $48 million which was classified in “Other non-current
liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance
sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot
be made.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special
purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent
arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.
Indemnifications
The information set forth under Note 6 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our
consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical
accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations,
and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the
critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Streaming Content
We acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of
TV series and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content
licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for
content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in
operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
For licenses, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the
license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for
streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets,
net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production
overhead. We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and
residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced)
in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of
availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an
accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts,
and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content
assets on an ongoing basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.
29
Table of Contents
Our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore,
content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in
circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content asset. To date, we have not identified any such event or
changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of
unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be,
abandoned are written off.
Income Taxes
We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the
asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as
well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if
necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.
Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated
financial statements.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative
evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are
consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years
could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of
the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to
reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2018 the
valuation allowance of $125 million was primarily related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize.
We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may
recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December 31,
2018, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $48 million of which $44 million, if recognized, would favorably impact
our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax
positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the
Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax
years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial
system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31,
2017. In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the
period in which the legislation was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million
related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB
118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information
available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax
effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we have
completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118
tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to
the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.
See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt
and foreign currency fluctuations. In July 2017, we sold all short-term investments.
Interest Rate Risk
At December 31, 2018, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market
risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.
As of December 31, 2018, we had $10.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in ten tranches due between
2021 and 2029. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt
will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of
increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed
below.
Foreign Currency Risk
International revenues and cost of revenues account for 49% and 58%, respectively, of consolidated amounts for the year
ended December 31, 2018. The majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the
British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may
negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For
the year ended December 31, 2018, we believe our international revenues would have been approximately $94 million higher had
foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2017.
We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the
settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency.
In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a $1 million foreign exchange loss due to the remeasurement of significant
content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities, mostly offset by the
remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros.
In addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2018 was a
decrease of $40 million.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange
rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of
operations.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.
 
(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, our management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.
 
(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2018 and the related notes and our report dated January 29, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017,
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated January 29, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 /s/ Ernst & Young LLP
We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Netflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is
the world’s leading internet entertainment service with over 139 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV
series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want,
anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or
commitments. Additionally, over two million members in the U.S. subscribe to the Company's legacy DVD-by-mail service.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Segment Information presented in Note 11
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, certain expenses for personnel that support global
content and marketing that were previously classified in General and administrative expenses were reclassified to Cost of revenues
and Marketing, respectively. In addition, expenses for personnel that support global streaming delivery that were previously
classified in Technology and development were also reclassified to Cost of revenues. There is no change to consolidated operating
income, net income or cash flows or DVD segment results as a result of this change in classification. See Note 12 for further detail.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the streaming
content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes
principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the
expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of
2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Because the Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership
fees which are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period, the impact on its consolidated financial statements is not
material.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which requires amounts generally described as restricted
cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending
amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2018 and
the impact on its consolidated financial statements is not material as the Company's restricted cash balances are immaterial.
In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”)
provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed
return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company elected to treat any potential GILTI
inclusions as a period cost.
In August 2018, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification,
amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded. In addition,
45
Table of Contents
the amendments expanded the disclosure requirements on the analysis of stockholders' equity for interim financial statements.
Under the amendments, an analysis of changes in each caption of stockholders' equity presented in the balance sheet must be
provided in a note or separate statement. The analysis should present a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance
of each period for which a statement of comprehensive income is required to be filed. This final rule was effective on November 5,
2018. The Company adopted the rule in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the impact on its consolidated financial statements was not
material.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability
among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating
leases under current GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease
liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-
02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified
retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 utilizing
the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019.
While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2016-02, the Company estimates that the adoption of ASU
2016-02 will result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $700 million
on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash
equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card
transactions as cash equivalents.
In July 2017, the Company sold all short-term investments. The Company classified short-term investments, which consisted
of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments were reported at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and
declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income
(expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company used the specific identification method to determine cost in
calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.
Short-term investments were reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating
the investments, the Company reviewed factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis,
the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company
would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.
Streaming Content
The Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited
viewing of TV series and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for
certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense.
Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash
used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
For licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability
when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion
available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current
content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and
production overhead. These amounts are included in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and
produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of
availability or estimated period of use or 10 years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an
accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and
marketing efforts, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. The Company
46
Table of Contents
reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these
factors require considerable management judgment. 
The Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.
Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or
change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content asset. To date, the Company has not identified
any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be
stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or
are expected to be, abandoned are written off.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for
leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are capitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company
was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.
Revenue Recognition
The Company's primary source of revenues are from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of
their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net
of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership
fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been redeemed. The Company is the
principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”) manufacturers, multichannel video
programming distributors (“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”), provide access to the service as the
Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are
expensed, but in the case where the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the
Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.
Marketing
Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners,
including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as
digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,808 million, $1,091
million and $842 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Marketing expenses also include
payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service
offerings. Research and development expenses were $1,218 million, $981 million and $768 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations
using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if
necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.
The Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The
Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.

Foreign Currency
The functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which
the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated
using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative
translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
The Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates
in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income
(expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $1 million and $128 million for the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively, and a gain of $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Earnings Per Share
 Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and,
when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares
issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as follows:
 
 Year ended December 31,
 2018  2017  2016

Diluted earnings per share $ 2.68 $ 1.25 $ 0.43
Employee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from
the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the potential common
shares excluded from the diluted calculation:

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants fully vested non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate
vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option
forfeitures. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.

4.    Long-term Debt
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had aggregate outstanding long-term notes of $10,360 million, net of $89 million of
issuance costs, with varying maturities (the "Notes"). Each of the Notes were issued at par and are senior unsecured obligations of
the Company. Interest is payable semi-annually at fixed rates. A portion of the outstanding long-term notes is denominated in
foreign currency (comprised of €2,400 million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement
gain totaling $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2018).

a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity
in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium.
The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company's ability to create, incur or allow certain liens;
enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company's
subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries
assets, to another person. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all related
covenants.
Revolving Credit Facility
52
Table of Contents
In July 2017, the Company entered into a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”),
with an uncommitted incremental facility to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $250 million,
subject to certain terms and conditions. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until July 27, 2022, at which time
all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts have been borrowed under
the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate
equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted
LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of 0.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the
Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus 0.500% and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate
for a one-month interest period, plus 1.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in
U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO
Rate be less than 0.00% per annum.
The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at a rate
of 0.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit
or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries
to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate,
liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.
5.Commitments and Contingencies
Streaming Content
At December 31, 2018, the Company had $19.3 billion of obligations comprised of $4.7 billion included in "Current content
liabilities" and $3.8 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $10.8 billion of obligations
that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had $17.7 billion of obligations comprised of $4.2 billion included in "Current content
liabilities" and $3.3 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $10.2 billion of obligations
that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.
The expected timing of payments for these streaming content obligations is as follows:
 As of December 31,
 2018  2017
 (in thousands)
Less than one year $8,611,398 $7,446,947
Due after one year and through 3 years 8,841,561 8,210,159
Due after 3 years and through 5 years 1,684,582 1,894,001
Due after 5 years 148,334 143,535
Total streaming content obligations $19,285,875 $17,694,642
    
Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. Obligations that
are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content
includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related
commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an
agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are
not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the
number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated
obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be
significant.
Lease obligations
53
Table of Contents
The Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2034. Several
lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is
generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent
escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the
Company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The Company has the option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease
commitments.
Because the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site
required the Company’s involvement in the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for
accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company recorded an asset of $41 million, representing the total
costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the buildings), with
corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria
for de-recognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations. At
December 31, 2018, the lease financing obligation balance was $28 million, the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current
liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining future minimum payments under the lease financing obligation are
$11 million. The lease financing obligation balance at the end of the lease term will be approximately $22 million which
approximates the net book value of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.
In addition to the lease financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $1,157 million as of December 31, 2018
related to non-cancelable operating leases for the expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the office space in Los
Angeles, California.
Future minimum payments under lease financing obligations and non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018
are as follows:
 
Year Ending December 31,Future

2023 151,200
Thereafter 943,630
Total minimum payments $ 1,708,368
Rent expense associated with the operating leases was $107 million, $75 million and $53 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including
claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to
normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of
these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as
incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse
effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
The Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either
individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation
and events related thereto unfold.
6.Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations
54
Table of Contents
In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to
provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including,
but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement
claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
procedures specified in the particular contract.
The Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the
Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification
agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain
liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each
particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these
indemnification guarantees.

7.Stockholders’ Equity
Preferred Stock
The Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. None of
the preferred shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Voting Rights
The holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the
Company’s stockholders.
Stock Option Plans
In June 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2011 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock
options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock
units to employees, directors and consultants. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 8.7 million shares were reserved for future
grants under the 2011 Stock Plan.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the
Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2018 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money
options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of
2018. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options
exercised for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $863 million, $464 million and $189 million, respectively.
Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $125 million, $88 million
and $37 million, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation
Stock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status. The following
table summarizes the assumptions used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data:

Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands) 67,575 61,842 65,173
The Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated
option exercise behavior.
The Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of
publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of
the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.
In valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on
U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying
any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model.
The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the
Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax
years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial
system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31,
2017. In accordance with the Act, the Company recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of
2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47
million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118
("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary
information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain
income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, the
Company has completed the analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an
additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27
million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 (in thousands)
Deferred tax assets:   
Stock-based compensation $ 190,451 $ 149,367

Net deferred tax assets $ 564,425 $ 478,266
All deferred tax assets are classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31,
2018 and December 31, 2017. In evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available
positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings,
future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2018, the valuation allowance of $125
million was primarily related to certain foreign tax credits that are not likely to be realized.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company's Federal R&D tax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes
were $248 million, and $193 million, respectively. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2038. State tax credit
carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company's foreign tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $99 million. The
Federal foreign tax credit carryovers expire through 2028.
The unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as
“Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $48 million, of
which $44 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2017, the total
amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $43 million, of which $38 million, if recognized, would favorably impact

the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are
summarized as follows (in thousands):
 
Balances as of December 31, 2016 $ 19,739
Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods (3,226)
Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period 26,389
Balances as of December 31, 2017 42,902
Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods 4,486
Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods (17,922)
Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period 18,068
Balances as of December 31, 2018 $ 47,534
The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in
“Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for
income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.
The Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. In August 2018, the Company reached a favorable settlement
with the IRS for tax years 2014 & 2015 and recorded a discrete tax benefit of $7 million in the third quarter of 2018. The Company
is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016 and 2017 and the state of California for the years 2014 and 2015. The
2009 through 2017 state tax returns are subject to examination by state tax authorities. The Company is also currently under
examination in the UK for 2015 and 2016. The Company has no other significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years
2013 through 2017 remain subject to examination by foreign tax authorities.
Given the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential
expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly
change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this
time.
10.Employee Benefit Plan
The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute
up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue
Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s
matching contributions totaled $27 million, $20 million and $16 million, respectively.
11.Segment Information
The Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment
information is presented in the same manner that the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews the operating
results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for
each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses
incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable
segment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics. As markets
within the Company's International streaming segment become profitable, the CODM increasingly focuses on the Company's global
operating margin as a measure of profitability.
The Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to
the members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for
services related to streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from
monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the related payment processing fees are
attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographic
region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.
Amortization of streaming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. The Company obtains multi-territory or
global rights for its streaming content and allocates these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on
estimated fair market value. Amortization of content assets and other expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing, and
production of streaming content for each streaming segment thus includes both expenses directly incurred by the
60
Table of Contents
segment as well as an allocation of expenses incurred for global or multi-territory rights. Other costs of revenues such as delivery
costs are either attributed to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment or are allocated across
segments by management. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing
partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, which are generally included in the segment in which
the expenditures are directly incurred.

(1)A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix
service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or other promotional
offering by the Company to certain new and rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the
above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the
prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes
effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as
determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.
12.    Reclassification
 
The Company reclassified certain streaming personnel-related expenses on its Consolidated Statement of Operations effective
for the fourth quarter of 2018. Specifically, expenses for personnel that support global content and marketing that were previously
classified in General and administrative expenses were reclassified to Cost of revenues and Marketing, respectively. In addition,
expenses for personnel that support global streaming delivery that were previously classified in Technology and development were
also reclassified to Cost of revenues. The Company is making this change in classification in order to reflect how the nature of the
work performed by certain personnel has changed to be more directly related to the development, marketing and delivery of our
service as a result of the continued evolution of the Company’s strategy to self-produce and create more of its own content rather
than license or procure it from third parties. This change in classification will also align external presentation of personnel-related
expenses with the way that the Company's chief operating decision maker expects to assess profitability and make resource
allocation decisions going forward. The Company has reclassified these personnel-related expenses for all prior periods in order to
present comparable financial results. There is no change to consolidated operating income, net income or cash flows or DVD
segment results as a result of this change in classification.
The revised Consolidated Statements of Operations as well as segment results for the three month periods ended March 31,
2016, 2017 and 2018, June 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and December 31, 2016 and 2017 and for
