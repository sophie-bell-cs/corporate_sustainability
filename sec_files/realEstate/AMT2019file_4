Explanatory Note
On February 17, 2023, Equinix, Inc. (the “Company”) filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 (the “Original Form 10-K”). The Company is amending the Form 10-K due to a typographical error
in Exhibit 23.1 included in the Original Form 10-K, which resulted in Exhibit 23.1 not conforming to the consent provided
by the auditors. This Amendment No. 1 to the Original Form 10-K (the “Amendment”) amends the Original Form 10-K
solely to revise the consent of our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(“PwC”) filed originally as Exhibit 23.1. The consent included in the Original Form 10-K inadvertently omitted the
incorporation by reference into the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-249763) and S-8 (File
No. 333-239271), and erroneously included S-3 (File No. 333-221380). The revised consent by PwC is filed hereto as
Exhibit 23.1.
As required by Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, new certifications of the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer are being filed as exhibits to this Amendment.
Except as described above, no other amendments are being made to the Original 10-K. This Amendment does not
reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original 10-K or modify or update the disclosure contained therein in any
way other than as required to reflect the amendments discussed above.
