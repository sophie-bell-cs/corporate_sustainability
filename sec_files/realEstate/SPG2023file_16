2EXPLANATORY NOTE
This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2022 of
Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership.
Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Simon” mean Simon Property Group, Inc.
and references to the “Operating Partnership” mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to “we,” “us” and “our”
mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon
and/or the Operating Partnership.
Simon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our
business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon’s majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which
Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2022, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in
the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 12.6% ownership interest owned by limited partners. As the sole
general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership’s day-to-day
management.
We operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the
same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating
Partnership, Simon consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and Simon has no
material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities
of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.
We believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this
single report provides the following benefits:
●enhances investors’ understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view
the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;
●eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the
disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and
●creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate
reports.
We believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating
Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself
does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity
or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt
is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.
The Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership
interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured
as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which
are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by
Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock
issuances by Simon, preferred units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or preferred units, the
Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the
incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the
issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.
The presentation of stockholders’ equity, partners’ equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of
difference between the consolidated financial statements of Simon and those of the Operating Partnership. The
differences between stockholders’ equity and partners’ equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon
and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as
partners’ equity in the Operating Partnership’s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon’s
financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership’s financial statements include the
interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon’s financial
statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the
units held by limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Although classified differently, total equity of Simon and
the Operating Partnership is the same.
To help investors understand the differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership, this report
provides:
●separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;
Table of Contents
3●a single set of notes to such consolidated financial statements that includes separate discussions of
noncontrolling interests and stockholders’ equity or partners’ equity, accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) and per share and per unit data, as applicable;
●a combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
section that also includes discrete information related to each entity; and
●separate Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities sections related to each entity.
This report also includes separate Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31
and 32 certifications for each of Simon and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite
certifications have been made and that Simon and the Operating Partnership are each compliant with Rule 13a-14(a)
or Rule 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. §1350. The separate discussions of Simon
and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand our results
on a consolidated basis and how management operates our business.
In order to highlight the differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in
this report for Simon and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to Simon and the Operating Partnership. In the
sections that combine disclosure of Simon and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings of
Simon and the Operating Partnership as being “our” actions or holdings. Although the Operating Partnership is
generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures, holds assets and incurs debt, we
believe that references to “we,” “us” or “our” in this context is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and
we operate substantially all of our business through the Operating Partnership.

5Part I
Item 1.Business
Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue
Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less
than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership
subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. Unless stated otherwise or the context
otherwise requires, references to "Simon" mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the "Operating
Partnership" mean Simon Property Group, L.P.  References to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively Simon, the
Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating
Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to
pay all expenses of Simon.
We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which
consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, and The Mills®. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or held an interest
in 196 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 94 malls, 69 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills,
six lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 80% noncontrolling
interest in The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet
malls in the U.S. and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2022, we had ownership interests in 34 Premium
Outlets and Designer Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe and Canada. As of December 31, 2022, we
also owned a 22.4% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company,
which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe.
For a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2022, see Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K.
Other Policies
The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and
policies with respect to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time
to time without a stockholder vote.
Investment Policies
While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may also provide secured financing to or invest in
equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers consistent with
Simon’s qualification as a REIT. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership
limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification. These REIT limitations mean that Simon cannot
make an investment that would cause its real estate assets to be less than 75% of its total assets. Simon must also
derive at least 75% of its gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on
real property, including “rents from real property,” dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest
from certain types of temporary investments. In addition, Simon must also derive at least 95% of its gross income
from such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or
securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.
Subject to Simon’s REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with
acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited
partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or
more properties. We may, in the future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs,
management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.
 Additionally we have and may in the future make investments in entities engaged in non-real estate activities,
primarily through a taxable REIT subsidiary, similar to the investments we currently hold in certain retail operations.
Financing Policies
Because Simon’s REIT qualification requires us to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, we
regularly access the debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions, develop and redevelop
properties, and refinance maturing debt. We must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements
that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value, as defined. For example, the Operating Partnership’s lines
of credit and the indentures
Table of Contents
6for the Operating Partnership’s debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the
Operating Partnership to 65%, or 60% in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as defined under the related
agreements, and secured debt to 50% of total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants
requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical
matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for the debt securities of the Operating Partnership. We strive to
maintain investment grade ratings at all times for various business reasons, including their effect on our ability to
access attractive capital, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future.
If Simon’s Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital by offering
equity or incurring debt, creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties, entering into joint
venture arrangements for new development projects, retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods. If
Simon’s Board of Directors determines to raise equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional
shares of common stock or other capital stock. Simon’s Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the
amount of our authorized capital or may issue units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it
deems appropriate. We may also raise additional capital by issuing common units of partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership, or units. Such securities also may include additional classes of Simon’s preferred stock or
preferred units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or preferred units, which may be convertible into
common stock or units, as the case may be. Existing stockholders and unitholders have no preemptive right to
purchase shares or units in any subsequent issuances of securities by us. Any issuance of equity could dilute a
stockholder’s investment in Simon or a limited partner’s investment in the Operating Partnership.
We expect most future borrowings will be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We
might, however, incur borrowings through other entities that would be reloaned to the Operating Partnership.
Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase
money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. Any such
indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross-collateralized with other debt, or may
be fully or partially guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. We issue unsecured debt securities through the
Operating Partnership, but we may issue other debt securities which may be convertible into common or preferred
stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common or preferred stock. We also may sell or securitize our
lease receivables. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that
we will regularly do so.
The Operating Partnership has a $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility and a
$3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, or together, the Credit Facilities.
The Credit Facility can be increased in the form of additional commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$1.0 billion, for a total aggregate size of $5.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying
certain customary conditions precedent. The initial maturity date of the Credit Facility is June 30, 2024. The Credit
Facility can be extended for two additional six-month periods to June 30, 2025, at our sole option, subject to
satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans,
the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate,
(y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in Dollars,
Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily
SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of
between 0.650% and 1.400% or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to
the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one
month plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000%
and 0.400%. The Credit Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.100%
and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility.  Based upon our current credit ratings,
the interest rate on the Credit Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the
transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
The Supplemental Facility’s initial borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion may be increased to $4.5 billion during its
term. The initial maturity date of the Supplemental Facility is January 31, 2026 and can be extended for an additional
year to January 31, 2027 at our sole option, subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof.
Borrowings under the Supplemental Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark
Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted
TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated
in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating
Overnight Daily SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our
corporate credit rating of between
Table of Contents
70.650% and 1.400% or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to the
greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one month
plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000% and
0.400%. The Supplemental Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between
0.100% and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Supplemental Facility.  Based upon our
current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points, plus a spread
adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
The Operating Partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program, or
Commercial Paper program, of $2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof. The Operating Partnership may
issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in
non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by
the Operating Partnership. Notes are sold under customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note
markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the
Operating Partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Commercial Paper program is supported by the
Credit Facilities and, if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under the Credit Facilities to pay
amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program.
We may also finance our business through the following:
●issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock or warrants to purchase the same;
●issuance of additional units;
●issuance of preferred units;
●issuance of other securities, including unsecured notes and mortgage debt;
●draws on our Credit Facilities;
●borrowings under the Commercial Paper program; or
●sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties.
The Operating Partnership may also issue units to contributors of properties or other partnership interests
which may permit the contributor to defer tax gain recognition under the Internal Revenue Code.
We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular
property.
Mortgage financing instruments, however, typically limit additional indebtedness on such properties.
Additionally, the Credit Facilities, our unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow
and contain limits on mortgage indebtedness we may incur as well as certain financial covenants we must maintain.
Typically, we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at
attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property, or on a group of
properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an
institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings,
we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the
real estate industry, are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a
parent company. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and
whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include
the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our
consolidated indebtedness.
Conflict of Interest Policies
We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of
interest. Simon has adopted governance principles governing the function, conduct, selection, orientation and duties
of its subsidiaries and Simon’s Board of Directors and the Company, as well as written charters for each of the
standing Committees of Simon’s Board of Directors. In addition, Simon’s Board of Directors has a Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of its officers, directors, and employees and those of its subsidiaries. At least
a majority of the members of Simon’s Board of Directors must qualify, and do qualify, as independent under the listing
standards of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, and cannot be affiliated with the Simon family, who are
significant stockholders in Simon and/or unitholders in the Operating Partnership. In addition, the Audit and
Compensation and Human Capital Committees
Table of Contents
8of Simon’s Board of Directors are comprised entirely of independent members who meet the additional independence
and financial expert requirements of the NYSE as required.
The sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the
Simon family or other limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Any transaction between us and the Simon family,
including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail space leases, must be
approved by the Company’s Audit Committee.
In order to avoid any conflict of interest, the Simon charter requires that at least three-fourths of Simon’s
independent directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such
sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. A noncompetition agreement executed by Herbert Simon,
Simon’s Chairman Emeritus, and a noncompetition agreement executed by David Simon, Simon’s Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and President, which remains in effect notwithstanding the expiration of David Simon’s employment
agreement in 2019, contain covenants limiting their ability to participate in certain shopping center activities.
Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities
We intend to make investments which are consistent with Simon’s qualification as a REIT, unless Simon’s
Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in Simon’s best interests to so qualify as a REIT. Simon’s Board of
Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements.
Simon has authority to issue shares of its capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have
authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire Simon’s shares, the Operating Partnership’s units, or any other
securities. On May 16, 2022, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan, or the
Repurchase Program.  Under the program, the Company may purchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock during
the two-year period ending May 16, 2024. Simon may also issue shares of its common stock, or pay cash at its
option, to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders’ rights under the partnership agreement of
the Operating Partnership. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to the directors or executive officers of
Simon for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate. Additionally, we may make
or buy interests in loans secured by real estate properties owned by others or make investments in companies that
own real estate assets.
Competition
The retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive. We compete with numerous merchandise
distribution channels, including malls, outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers in the
United States and abroad. We also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs, including our tenants, which
provide retailers with distribution options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties. The existence of
competitive alternatives, accelerated by the impact of COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the
properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development
and operating properties). We believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to
retailers, including:
●the quality, location and diversity of our properties;
●our management and operational expertise;
●our extensive experience and relationships with retailers, lenders and suppliers;
●our marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances; and
●the sustainability of physical retail.
Certain Activities
During the past three years, we have:
●issued 354,455 shares of Simon common stock upon the exchange of units in the Operating Partnership;
●issued 751,042 restricted shares of Simon common stock and 108,694 long-term incentive performance
units, or LTIP units, net of forfeitures, under The Simon Property Group 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as
amended, or the 1998 Plan, and the Simon Property Group, L.P. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2019
Plan;

Repurchase Programs;
●issued 22,137,500 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $72.50 per

Human Capital
At December 31, 2022, we and our affiliates employed approximately 3,300 persons at various properties and
offices throughout the United States, of which approximately 800 were part-time. Approximately 1,000 of these
employees were located at our corporate headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana.
We believe our employees are the driving force behind our success.  To ensure we continue to attract, develop
and retain the best talent across the organization, we invest in our employees and provide equal opportunities. We
offer a variety of ongoing talent programs that foster continual development, high performance and overall
organizational effectiveness, including a series of leadership development programs. We conduct an annual talent-
assessment process for selected business functions within our corporate and field organizations that includes plans
for individual employee career development and long-term leadership succession, and also conduct an annual
performance appraisal process for all regular employees.
We are focused on providing a work environment that is free from any form of discrimination or harassment for
any protected class and also embraces principles of inclusiveness. We have implemented a sustainable diversity and
inclusion strategy, including an internal policy, targeted solutions for employees and an annual process of
assessment, action and evaluation led by our human resources department.
Our compensation program is designed to, among other things, attract, retain and motivate talented and
experienced individuals using a mix of competitive salaries, bonuses, equity based awards and other benefits.
Government Regulations Affecting Our Properties
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations that apply generally to the ownership of
real property and the operations conducted on real property.  As of December 31, 2022, we are not aware of any
environmental conditions or material costs of complying with environmental or other regulations that would have a
material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition, or results of operations.  However, it is possible
that we are not aware of, or may become subject to, potential environmental liabilities or material costs of complying
with governmental regulations that could be material.  See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our
management from time to time. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, liquidity, results of operations, funds from operations, or FFO, and prospects, which we refer to herein as a
material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us, and you should carefully consider them.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may
also affect our actual results. We may update these factors in our future periodic reports.
Summary of Risk Factors
The following summarizes our material risk factors. However, this summary is not intended to be a
comprehensive and complete list of all risk factors identified by the Company. Refer to the following pages of this
section for additional details regarding these summarized risk factors and other additional risk factors identified by the
Company.
● Conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us.
● Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract
shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors
or tenants.
● We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.
● Vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us.
● We may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing
properties with an appropriate mix of tenants or at desired rents, if at all.
● Acts of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity and actual or threatened terrorist attacks could adversely
affect our business operations.
● We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-
commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits.
● The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and governmental reactions thereto, as well as other future epidemics,
pandemics or public health crises, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants’
business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the
capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.
● Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.
● Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.
● We face risks associated with climate change.
● As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination, and our efforts to
identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.
● We face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.
● Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.
● Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs in the
United States. The failure to maintain Simon’s or the Subsidiary REITs’ qualifications as REITs or
changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences.
● If the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would
cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.
Table of Contents
12● Complying with REIT requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities
or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.
● Our ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty
tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm’s-length
terms.
● Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some
dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.
● The tax imposed on REITs engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in
transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
● REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business
plan.
● Partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us.
● Legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting REITs, including positions taken by the
IRS, could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors.
● Provisions in Simon’s charter and by-laws and in the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement
could prevent a change of control.
● We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.
● The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us
that might affect our ability to operate freely.
● Disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financings
for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements.
● Adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.
● An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely
impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms, or at all; our hedging interest rate
protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.
● We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third
parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them.
● The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture
properties.
● We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as
well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems.
● An increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)
factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.
● Our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated
with our domestic operations.
● Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and develop talented employees, and our
failure to do so, including the loss of any one of our key personnel, could adversely impact our business.
Risk Related to Tenant Operations at Our Properties
Conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect
us.
Our primary source of revenue is derived from retail tenants which means that we could be materially and
adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally, including,
without limitation:
● domestic issues, such as government policies and regulations, tariffs, energy prices, market dynamics,
rising interest rates, inflation and limited growth in consumer income as well as from actual or perceived
changes in economic conditions, which can result from global events such as international trade
disputes, a foreign debt crisis, foreign currency volatility, natural disasters, war, such as the conflict in
Ukraine, epidemics and pandemics, the fear of spread of contagious diseases, civil unrest and terrorism,
as well as from;
● levels of consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, income levels, and fluctuations in
seasonal spending in the United States and internationally;
Table of Contents
13● supply chain disruptions and labor shortages;
● consumers avoiding in-person shopping due to a heightened level of concern for safety in public places
due to heightened sensitivity to risks associated with transmission of disease, as occurred during the
COVID-19 pandemic, or consumer perception of increased risk of criminal activity and civil unrest,
including acts of terrorism, riots, random acts of violence, mass shootings or inappropriate or
unacceptable behavior of other patrons;
● significant reductions in international travel and tourism, resulting in fewer international retail consumers;
● consumer perceptions of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties;
● the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties from the increasing use of
the Internet by retailers and consumers, which accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic;
● the creditworthiness of our retail tenants and the availability of new creditworthy tenants and the related
impact on our occupancy levels and lease income;
● local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or reduction in demand for, retail space or retail
goods, decreases in rental rates and declines in real estate values;
● the willingness of retailers to lease space in our properties at attractive rents, or at all;
● changes in regional and local economies, which may be affected by increased rates of unemployment,
increased foreclosures, higher taxes, decreased tourism, industry slowdowns, adverse weather
conditions, and other factors;
● increased operating costs and capital expenditures, whether from redevelopments, replacing tenants or
otherwise;
● changes in applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning; and
● epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, and the governmental
reaction thereto.
To the extent that any or a portion of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact the retail industry, our
retail tenants, the emergence of new tenants, our own investments in certain retailers and brands, the demand for
retail space, market rents and rent growth, the vacancy levels at our properties, the value of our properties, which
could directly or indirectly materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and overall asset
value.
Additionally, a portion of our lease income is derived from overage rents based on sales over a stated base
amount that directly depend on the sales volume of our retail tenants. Accordingly, declines in our tenants’ sales
performance could reduce the income produced by our properties. Over time, declines in our tenants’ sales
performance can also negatively impact our ability to sign new and renewal leases at desired rents.
Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract
shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or
tenants.
Our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants.
Certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations, downsized their brick-and-mortar presence or
failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others, and such actions became more prevalent during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sustained adverse pressure on the results of department stores and other national retailers may have a
similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results. Certain department stores and other national retailers have
experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future (given uncertainty with respect to current and
future macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence levels), considerable decreases in customer traffic in
their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet and
other forms of pressure on their business models. As pressure on these department stores and other national
retailers increases, their ability to maintain their stores, meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders
and suppliers, withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy and/or liquidation may be impaired and result in
closures of their stores or their
Table of Contents
14seeking of a lease modification with us. Any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could
decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges. Certain other tenants are entitled to modify
the economic or other terms of, or terminate, their existing leases with us in the event of such closures. Additionally,
corporate merger or consolidation activity among department stores and other national retailers typically results in the
closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations.
If a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties, we may
experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space, as well as in leasing spaces in
areas adjacent to the vacant store, at attractive rates, or at all. Additionally, department store or tenant closures may
result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties. If the sales of stores
operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers,
adverse economic conditions or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense
recovery charges. In the event of any default by a tenant, we may not be able to fully recover, and/or may experience
delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover, amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with
such parties.
We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.
Bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations. Although we have not seen
an increase in tenant bankruptcies in the last two years, in previous years a number of companies in the retail
industry, including certain of our tenants, declared bankruptcy, especially during the height of the COVID-19
pandemic. If a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its
leases with us, and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental
payments to us in a timely manner. A bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants would generally prohibit us
from evicting this tenant, and bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant, or from their
property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. In addition, we cannot evict a
tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. If a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy
balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. If a lease is rejected, the unsecured claim we hold against a
bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid
to all other holders of unsecured claims, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the
claim we can make if a lease is rejected. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full
value of any unsecured claims we hold. In addition, we may make lease modifications either pre- or post-bankruptcy
for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern.
Furthermore, we may be required to incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space formerly leased to the
bankrupt tenant. We continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations. The bankruptcy of
a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations, may require a substantial
redevelopment of its space, the success of which cannot be assured, and may make the re-tenanting of its space
difficult and costly. Any such bankruptcies also make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the
affected property or properties. Future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to
successfully execute our re-leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us.
Vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us.
Certain of our properties have had vacant space available for prospective tenants, and those properties may
continue to experience, and other properties may commence experiencing, such oversupply in the future. Among
other causes, (1) there has historically been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national
retailers, as well as store closures, and (2) there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space, due to certain
retailers increasing their use of e-commerce websites to distribute their merchandise, with each of (1) and (2)
accelerating as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy
retail tenants, there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels, and this increased bargaining
power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease
modifications in order to attract or retain tenants, any of which, in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect
us.
We may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing
properties with an appropriate mix of tenants or at desired rents, if at all.
We may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer
traffic. Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting,
including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms.
Tenant preferences
Table of Contents
15for properties may also change over time, like recent trends towards right-sizing portfolios, repositioning space and
locations and pursuing new store concepts, and our properties may no longer align with such preferences. If we fail to
identify and secure the right blend of tenants at our newly developed and existing properties, our properties may not
appeal to the communities they serve. If we elect to pursue a “mixed use” redevelopment we expose ourselves to
risks associated with each non-retail use (e.g. office, residential, hotel and entertainment), and the performance of our
retail tenants in such properties may be negatively impacted by delays in opening and/or the performance of such
non-retail uses. Additionally, an oversupply of retail properties in the broader market could reduce market rents,
negatively impacting the terms upon which we lease our properties. To the extent that our leasing goals are not
achieved, we could be materially and adversely affected.
Acts of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity and actual or threatened terrorist attacks could
adversely affect our business operations.
Because our properties are open to the public, they are exposed to risks related to acts of violence, civil unrest
and criminal activity as well as actual or threatened terrorist attacks that may be beyond our control or ability to
prevent. If any of these incidents were to occur, the relevant property could face material damage physically and
reputationally, and the revenue generated by such property could be negatively impacted. Consumers may also
perceive a heightened threat of these risks due to increased crime in certain markets and negative media attention.
Concern around safety risk may impact the willingness of consumers, tenants and tenants’ employees to shop and/or
work at our properties, which could result in decreased consumer traffic and decreased sales at our properties,
directly and indirectly impacting our revenue and overall asset value.
We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-
commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits.
Our properties compete with other forms of retailing such as pure online retail websites as well as other types
of retail properties such as single user freestanding discounters (Costco, Walmart and Target). In addition, many of
our tenants are omni-channel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales and provide options to
consumers like buy online pick up in store, buy online ship to store or buy online return to store. Our business
currently is predominantly reliant on consumer demand for shopping at physical stores, and our business could be
materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consumer purchasing
habits. The increased popularity of digital and mobile technologies has accelerated the transition of a percentage of
market share from shopping at physical stores to web-based shopping, and the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions
intended to prevent its spread significantly increased the utilization of e-commerce and may, particularly in certain
market segments, accelerate the long-term penetration of pure online retail. Although a brick-and-mortar presence
may have a positive impact on retailers’ online sales, the increased utilization of pure online shopping may lead to the
closure of underperforming stores by retailers, which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants
are willing to pay to lease our space. Additionally, the increase in online shopping may result in certain tenants
underreporting sales at our properties which may materially and adversely impact our collection of overage rent.
Examples may include, retailers and restaurants not reporting curbside pick-up sales or online sales fulfilled with
store inventory, and tenants reducing store sales by including online returns processed in the store.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and governmental reactions thereto, as well as other future
epidemics, pandemics or public health crises, could have a significant negative impact on our and our
tenants’ business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access
the capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and resurgences or variants or other epidemics, pandemics or health
crises could have, a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world and an adverse
impact on economic activity in retail real estate. Although consumer activity has been normalizing, there is no
guarantee that retail will return to or remain at pre-pandemic levels. Governments and other authorities could respond
to a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other epidemics, pandemics and public health crises, by imposing or
re-imposing measures intended to control the spread of disease, including restrictions on freedom of movement,
group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-
at-home, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. Although we believe any such
measures would likely be more moderate than those imposed at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic given the
consequences of stricter measures, any restrictions could negatively impact us, our tenants and consumer behavior.
Table of Contents
16Demand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends, in part, on the ability and willingness of
tenants to enter into and perform obligations under leases, and the willingness of customers to visit our properties.
Even without strict governmental restrictions, the willingness of consumers to visit our properties may be reduced and
our tenants’ businesses adversely affected, based upon many factors, including local transmission rates of disease,
the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution, effectiveness and acceptance of existing
and new vaccines, the effectiveness and availability of cures or treatments, and overall sensitivity to risks associated
with the transmission of diseases. In addition, some of our properties are located at or within a close proximity to
tourist destinations, and these properties and our tenants’ businesses were, and may be in the future, heavily and
adversely impacted by reductions in travel and tourism resulting from travel bans or restrictions and general concern
regarding the risk of travel.
Additionally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics, pandemics or public health crises, and
governmental reactions thereto, on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and
ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders could depend on additional
factors, including:
● the financial condition and viability of our tenants, and their ability or willingness to pay rent in full;
● state, local, federal and industry-initiated tenant relief efforts that may adversely affect landlords,
including us, and their ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent;
● the increased popularity and utilization of e-commerce;
● our ability to renew leases or re-lease available space in our properties on favorable terms or at all,
including as a result of a deterioration in the economic and market conditions in the markets in which we
own properties or due to restrictions intended to prevent the spread of disease, including any additional
government mandated closures of businesses that frustrate our leasing activities;
● a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and
equity capital markets, all of which were experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and which may
 affect our or our tenants' ability to access capital necessary to fund our or their respective business
operations or repay, refinance or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, on attractive terms, or at all
and may adversely affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, any of which could affect our and
our tenants' ability to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements;
● a refusal or failure of one or more lenders under our credit facility to fund their respective financing
commitment to us may affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our business operations and
to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements;
● a reduction in the cash flows generated by our properties and the values of our properties that could
result in impairments or limit our ability to dispose of them at attractive prices or obtain debt financing
secured by our properties;
● the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants' manufacturing facilities or distribution
centers, temporary or long-term disruption in our tenants' supply chains from local and international
suppliers and/or delays in the delivery of our tenants' inventory, any of which could reduce or eliminate
our tenants' sales, cause the temporary closure of our tenants' businesses, and/or result in their
bankruptcy or insolvency;
● a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending caused by high unemployment levels, reduced
economic activity or a severe or prolonged recession;
● our and our tenants' ability to manage our respective businesses to the extent our and their management
or personnel (including on-site employees) are impacted in significant numbers or are otherwise not
willing, available or allowed to conduct work, including any impact on our tenants' ability to deliver timely
information to us that is necessary for us to make effective decisions; and
● our and our tenants' ability to ensure business continuity in the event our or our tenants' continuity of
operations plan is (i) not effective or improperly implemented or deployed or (ii) compromised due to
increased cyber and remote access activity during such epidemic, pandemic or other public health crisis.
Table of Contents
17To the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or
otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.
Risks Related to Real Estate Holdings and Operations
Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.
A number of our properties are located in areas subject to a higher risk of natural disasters such as
earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, floods, tornados, hail or tsunamis.  In 2023, the weather phenomenon known as El
Nino has returned. This phenomenon generally results in an increase in storms, flooding, and landslides in Southern
California, heavier precipitation along the Gulf of Mexico, and an increase in severe weather in Florida. The
occurrence of natural disasters at any of our properties, which could become more intense and more volatile in light
of climate change, can adversely impact operations and development/redevelopment projects at our properties,
increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and
negatively impact our tenants and the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us or is
unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, we could be
materially and adversely affected.
Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.
We maintain insurance coverage with third-party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific
layers of potential losses, including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss
insurance on all of our properties in the United States as well as cyber coverage. The initial portion of coverage,
excess of policy deductibles, not provided by third-party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive
insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us. A third party carrier has, in turn, agreed to
provide, if required, evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s policy.
A similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us
also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal
windstorm locations.
There are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured or
are subject to large deductibles. Additionally, insurance costs and availability may be impacted in the future by factors
outside of our control, like inflationary pressures or cybersecurity events. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of
insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the
anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial
obligation related to the property.
We currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States
on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any
threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect our property values,
revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.
We face risks associated with climate change.
Due to changes in weather patterns caused by climate change, our properties in certain markets could
experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, climate change could result in population
migration or volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our
inability to operate the properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing
the cost of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms, or at all, increasing the cost of energy at our
properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks. Moreover,
compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes,
may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our
properties.
As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination, and our efforts to
identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.
Many of our properties contain, or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground
storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment),
and as a result we may be subject to regulatory action in connection with U.S. federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to hazardous or toxic substances. We may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or
property damage incurred
Table of Contents
18by the parties in connection with any such substances. The costs of investigation, removal or remediation of
hazardous or toxic substances, and related liabilities, may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us.
The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate the related contamination, may also
adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral.
Although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with U.S. federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing.
Nearly all of our properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These environmental
audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have
a material adverse effect on us. However, we cannot assure you that:
● previous environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;
● any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition
not known to us;
● the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the
condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or
● future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and
regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities.
We face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of
properties.
We regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties, and these
activities are subject to various risks. Acquisition or construction costs of a project may be higher than projected,
potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable, and development, redevelopment or expansions may take
considerably longer than expected, delaying the commencement and amount of income from the property. These
risks, and the potential impact thereof, may be exacerbated by the volume and complexity of such activity, as well as
inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, like those experienced in
2022. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. In
addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as expected,
impacting our anticipated return on investment. We are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition,
development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:
● we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms, or at all;
● we may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;
● occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be accretive;
● we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores, anchor tenants, mortgage lenders
and joint venture partners, and those consents may be withheld;
● development, redevelopment or expansions may fail to appeal to the demographics of the communities
they are intended to serve; and
● acquisitions of new properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may
not be aware of at the time of the acquisition.
If a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our
expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning, we could lose our investment
in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property’s financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.
In the event that these risks were realized at the same time at multiple properties, we could be materially and
adversely affected.
Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.
Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are
relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response
to any changes
Table of Contents
19in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as
general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and
demand for space, that are beyond our control. If we want to sell a property, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to dispose of it in the desired time period, or at all, or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the
relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment. Moreover, if a property is mortgaged, we may not be
able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial
prepayment penalty, which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property, even though the sale might otherwise
be desirable.
Risks Relating to Income Taxes and REIT Rules
Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs in the
United States. The failure to maintain Simon’s or the Subsidiary REITs’ qualifications as REITs or changes in
applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences.
In the United States, Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as
REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that Simon and these subsidiaries,
or the Subsidiary REITs, have been organized and have operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for
taxation as REITs under the Internal Revenue Code. We intend to continue to operate in this manner. However,
qualification and taxation as REITs depend upon the ability of Simon and the Subsidiary REITs to satisfy several
requirements (some of which are outside our control), including tests related to our annual operating results, asset
diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. The various REIT qualification tests required by the
Internal Revenue Code are highly technical and complex. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Simon or any
of the Subsidiary REITs has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner
so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
If Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs fail to comply with those provisions, Simon or any such Subsidiary
REIT may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as REITs. If such events occur,
and if available relief provisions do not apply:
● Simon or any such subsidiary will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in
computing taxable income;
● Simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to corporate-level income tax on taxable income at the
corporate rate;
● Simon may be subject to the one-percent excise tax on stock repurchases imposed by the 2022 Inflation
Reduction Act;
● Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable
years prior to 2018; and
● unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, Simon or any such subsidiary will also be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which
qualification was lost.
Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for, among
other things, our operations and distributions to stockholders. In addition, if Simon fails to qualify as a REIT, it will not
be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Moreover, a failure by any subsidiary of the Operating
Partnership that has elected to be taxed as a REIT to qualify as a REIT could also cause Simon to fail to qualify as a
REIT, and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders. Failure by Simon or any of the
Subsidiary REITs to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, which
could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we are subject to certain income-based taxes, both domestically
and internationally, and other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, and withholding taxes on
dividends from certain of our international investments. We currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various
domestic and international jurisdictions. Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may
increase accordingly.
If the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would
cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.
We believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a
Table of Contents
20partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its
partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner’s share of its income.
We cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, will not challenge the status of the Operating
Partnership or any other subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest as a
disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.
If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset
tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of the
Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or
partnership for applicable income tax purposes could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate
income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its
partners or members, including us.
Complying with REIT requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition
opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.
To qualify to be taxed as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Simon and the Subsidiary REITs must
ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of their respective assets consist of cash,
cash items, government securities and “real estate assets” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), including
certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of their respective investments (other than government
securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS) generally cannot
include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of
the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
Additionally, in general, no more than 5% of the value of Simon’s and the Subsidiary REITs’ total assets (other
than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities
of any one issuer, and no more than 20% of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities
of one or more TRSs. If Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs fails to comply with these requirements at the end of
any calendar quarter, Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the
calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its REIT qualification and suffering
adverse tax consequences. As a result, we might be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments.
These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders.
Moreover, if Simon or the Subsidiary REITs are compelled to liquidate their investments to meet any of the asset,
income or distribution tests, or to repay obligations to lenders, Simon or such subsidiaries may be unable to comply
with one or more of the requirements applicable to REITs or may be subject to a 100% tax on any resulting gain if
such sales constitute prohibited transactions.
In addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as REITs, Simon and the Subsidiary REITs
must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of their respective income, the amounts
they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares. We might be unable to pursue
investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-
diversification requirements for qualifying as REITs. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our
ability to make certain attractive investments.
Our ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty
tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm’s-length
terms.
We own securities in TRSs and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation
other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT
to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the
outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some
activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business, including the
provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A TRS is subject to federal income tax
as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and
its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis.
A REIT’s ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not
more than 25% of the value of Simon’s or any Subsidiary REIT’s total assets may be represented by securities
(including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of
the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We
anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon
or each such Subsidiary
Table of Contents
21REIT owns will be less than 25% (or, in the case of securities of TRSs, 20%) of the value of Simon’s or such
subsidiary’s total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable
ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they
are entered into on arm’s-length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no
assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100%
excise tax discussed above.
Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some
dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.
Income from “qualified dividends” payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates are
generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by
REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. U.S.
stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g.,
dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable
years beginning before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain
dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such
tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income.
Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less
attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could materially and
adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.
The tax imposed on REITs engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in
transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
A REIT’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited
transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be
characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, such characterization is a factual
determination (unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors), and no guarantee can be
given that the IRS, would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use
of the available safe harbors.
REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our
business plan.
In order for Simon and the Subsidiary REITs to qualify to be taxed as REITs, and assuming that certain other
requirements are also satisfied, Simon and each such Subsidiary REIT generally must distribute at least 90% of their
respective REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net
capital gains, to their respective equity holders each year. To the extent that Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT
satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a REIT, but distributes less than 100% of its REIT
taxable income, Simon or such subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net
taxable income and could be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity
holders in a calendar year is less than the minimum required distribution amount. We intend to make distributions to
the equity holders of Simon and the Subsidiary REITs to comply with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue
Code.
From time to time, Simon and the Subsidiary REITs might generate taxable income greater than their
respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual
receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves, or required debt or
amortization payments. If Simon or the Subsidiary REITs do not have other funds available in these situations, Simon
or such subsidiaries could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms (the receipt of which cannot be
assured), sell assets at disadvantageous prices, distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future
acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt
securities to make distributions sufficient to enable them to pay out enough of their respective REIT taxable income to
satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year.
These alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity. Further, amounts distributed will not be available to fund
the growth of our business. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our
ability to execute our business plan.

22Partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us.
Under the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships, subject to certain exceptions, any
audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner’s distributive
share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected, at
the partnership level. Absent available elections, it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly
invest could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as
a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes,
interest, and penalties even though Simon and the Subsidiary REITs, as REITs, may not otherwise have been
required to pay additional corporate-level taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly. The partnership
tax audit rules apply to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on
us.
Legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting REITs, including positions taken by
the IRS, could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors.
The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the
legislative process, and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws
or interpretations thereof by the IRS and the Treasury, with or without retroactive application, could materially and
adversely affect us and our investors. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors and
us. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and
negatively affect the ability of Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership to qualify to be taxed as
REITs and/or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification. Moreover, the
law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an
investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.
Provisions in Simon’s charter and by-laws and in the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement
could prevent a change of control.
Simon’s charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8% of its capital
stock. The charter permits the members of the Simon family and related persons to own up to 18% of Simon’s capital
stock. Ownership is determined by the lower of the number of outstanding shares, voting power or value controlled.
Simon’s Board of Directors may, by majority vote, permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where Simon’s
Board of Directors determines that Simon’s ability to qualify as a REIT will not be jeopardized. These restrictions on
ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might
otherwise be in the best interest of Simon’s stockholders or the Operating Partnership’s unitholders or preferred
unitholders. Other provisions of Simon’s charter and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change
of control even if some of Simon’s stockholders or the Operating Partnership’s unitholders or preferred unitholders
deem such a change to be in their best interests. These include provisions preventing holders of Simon’s common
stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by
holders of Class B common stock. In addition, certain provisions of the Operating Partnership’s partnership
agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. These include a provision requiring the
consent of a majority in interest of units in order for Simon, as general partner of the Operating Partnership, to,
among other matters, engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets.
Risks Related to Indebtedness and the Financial Markets
We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.
As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related
premium, discount and debt issuance costs, totaled $25.0 billion. As a result of this indebtedness, we are required to
use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service, including selected repayment at scheduled maturities,
which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business. We are also subject to the risks
normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to
meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all. Our
debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property, such as the entry of new
competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. Our indebtedness could
also have other adverse consequences on us,
Table of Contents
23including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and
market conditions. In addition, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such
property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in
a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. If any of the foregoing occurs, we could be materially and
adversely affected.
The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on
us that might affect our ability to operate freely.
We have a variety of unsecured debt, including the Credit Facilities, senior unsecured notes and commercial
paper, and secured property level debt. Certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants,
including, among other things, limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness, sell all or
substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions. In addition, certain of the agreements
that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including
certain coverage ratios. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain
transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us. In addition, our ability to comply with these provisions might
be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an
event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our
indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external
financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements.
We depend on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business, execute on
our business model, and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. Our access to
financing depends on our credit ratings, the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit
to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. An economic recession may cause extreme volatility and
disruption in the capital and credit markets. We rely upon the Credit Facilities as sources of funding for numerous
transactions. Our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the Credit
Facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. When markets are volatile, access to capital and credit markets
could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available
capital to meet their previous commitments to us. The failure of one or more participants to the Credit Facilities to
meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us, including as a result of making it
difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth and/or meeting our debt service requirements.
Additionally, a high interest rate environment, as we are currently experiencing, could prevent us from accessing
capital at attractive interest rates, which could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt at maturity as
well as our ability to fund development and/or opportunistic acquisition activities. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business, execution on our business model or to
meet our debt service requirements, or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms,
or at all.
Adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.
The Operating Partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes, the Credit Facilities, the Commercial Paper
program, and Simon’s preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The
credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects,
and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to us and our industry and the economic outlook in
general. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we
obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our
credit ratings, including actual changes and changes in outlook, or even the initiation of a review of our credit ratings
that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us.
An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could
adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms, or at all; our hedging interest rate
protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that
bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future. When interest rates
increase, then so does the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash
flows and our
Table of Contents
24ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Further, rising
interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future
interest expense.
We selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection
agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at
times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be
successful.
Our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may
expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its
obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in
relatively large amounts or on short notice. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no
strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance
that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition. Termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage
costs.
Risks Related to Joint Ventures
We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third
parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned interests in 100 income-producing properties with other parties. Of
those, 18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements. We apply the equity method of accounting
to the other 82 properties (the joint venture properties) and our investments in Klépierre (a publicly traded, Paris-
based real estate company), The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, and Jamestown, as well as our investments
in certain entities involved in retail operations, such as J.C. Penney and SPARC Group; intellectual property and
licensing venture, such as Authentic Brands Group, LLC, or ABG; and an e-commerce venture Rue Gilt Groupe, or
RGG, (collectively, our other platform investments). We serve as general partner or property manager for 51 of these
82 joint venture properties; however, certain major decisions, such as approving the operating budget and selling,
refinancing, and redeveloping the properties, require the consent of the other owners. Of the joint venture properties
for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 24 are in our international joint ventures. These
international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our
partner. The other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control
over the joint venture properties’ assets. The remaining joint venture properties, Klépierre, TRG, Jamestown, and our
joint ventures with ABG, J.C. Penney, RGG, and SPARC Group are managed by third parties.
These investments, and other future similar investments, could involve risks that would not be present were a
third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a
deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. If one of our partners
or other owners in these investments were to become bankrupt, we may be precluded from taking certain actions
regarding our investments without prior court approval, which at a minimum may delay the actions we would or might
want to take. Additionally, partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are
inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our
policies or objectives.
These investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on
decisions, such as a sale, financing or development, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full
control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in
litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent Simon’s officers and/or directors from focusing
their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might
result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we risk the
possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners.
The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint
venture properties.
Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture
property, which is non-recourse to us. Nevertheless, the joint venture’s failure to satisfy its debt obligations could
result in the loss of our investment therein. As of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint
venture-related mortgage indebtedness of $128.0 million. A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would

25under a guaranty. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a
basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically
required contractually or otherwise.
General Risk Factors
We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise,
as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems.
Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform
day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. We face risks
associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware,
computer viruses, hardware or software corruption or failure or poor product or vendor/developer selection (including
a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), service provider error or
failure, intentional or unintentional actions by employees (including the failure to follow our security protocols) and
other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. Although we make efforts to maintain the security
and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, including making recent upgrades to our IT programs
through significant capital investment, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security
breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that
attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected
information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such
attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some
cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate
these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible
for us to entirely mitigate this risk. We may also face significant disruptions due to natural disasters or other critical
incidents.
The risk of a security breach or significant disruption has generally increased due to our increased reliance on
technology, a rise in the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks globally, and the permanent nature
of remote work  as business travel has resumed and people now routinely work remotely outside of normal business
hours. A breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems, including our primary
website, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, tenants and revenues, generate third party
claims, cause operational disruption, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the
misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and/or confidential information, and require us to incur significant
expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. We may not be able to recover these
expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties, or their or our insurers.
Additionally, cyber-attacks perpetrated against our tenants, including unauthorized access to customers’ credit
card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and spending  at our tenants, or
negatively impact consumer perception of shopping at our properties, all of which could materially and adversely
affect us.
An increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)
factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.
Investors and other stakeholders have become more focused on understanding how companies address a
variety of ESG factors. As they evaluate investment decisions, many investors look not only at company disclosures
but also to ESG rating systems that have been developed by third parties to allow ESG comparisons among
companies. Although we participate in a number of these ratings systems, we do not participate in all such systems.
The criteria used in these ratings systems may conflict and change frequently, and we cannot predict how these third
parties will score us, nor can we have any assurance that they score us accurately or other companies accurately or
that other companies have provided them with accurate data. We supplement our participation in ratings systems with
published disclosures of our ESG activities, but some investors may desire other disclosures that we do not provide.
In addition, the SEC is currently evaluating potential rule making that could mandate additional ESG disclosure and
impose other requirements on us. Failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems, failure to score
well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain ESG disclosures could result in reputational harm when
investors compare us to other companies, and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock
which could adversely impact our stock price.

26Our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those
associated with our domestic operations.
As of December 31, 2022, we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in
Austria, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Thailand,
and the United Kingdom. We also have an equity stake in Klépierre, a publicly traded European real estate company,
which operates in 14 countries in Europe. Accordingly, our operating results and the value of our international
operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations
transact and in which our net investment in those international operations is held. While we occasionally enter into
hedging agreements to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, these agreements may not
eliminate foreign currency risk entirely.
We may pursue additional investment, ownership, development and redevelopment/expansion opportunities
outside the United States. Such international activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our
domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to:
● adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;
● changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;
● impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants’ supply chain and
consumer spending levels;
● challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corporate governance, operations,
taxes and litigation;
● the risk that we, our employees and/or agents could violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption and international
trade laws in the U.S., such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and certain foreign countries, such
as the U.K. Bribery Act, which could result in criminal or civil sanctions and/or fines, negatively impact our
reputation, or require us to incur significant expenses to investigate;
● differing lending practices;
● differences in cultures and consumer retail behavior;
● changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect international operations;
● changes in applicable laws and regulations in these foreign jurisdictions;
● difficulties in managing international operations;
● obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; and
● labor discord, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics, including COVID-19,
the fear of spread of contagious diseases, supply chain disruptions or the threat of international boycotts.
Our international activities represented approximately 7.7% of consolidated net income and 8.9% of our net
operating income, or NOI, for the year ended December 31, 2022. To the extent that we expand our international
activities, the above risks could increase in significance, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and develop talented employees, and our
failure to do so, including the loss of any one of our key personnel, could adversely impact our business.
The success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive
management team and key employees, including our CEO, who operate without the existence of employment
agreements. Many of our senior executives have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate
industry, which aid us in identifying opportunities and negotiating with tenants. Our ability to attract, retain and
motivate talented employees, and develop talent internally, could significantly impact our future performance.
Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management
team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract, retain and/or develop other highly qualified
individuals for these positions in the future. Additionally, the compensation and benefits packages we may need to
offer to remain competitive for these individuals could increase the cost of replacement and retention. Losing any one
or more of these persons could adversely affect our business, disrupt short-term operational performance, diminish
our opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and
others, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

United States Properties
Our U.S. properties primarily consist of malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, lifestyle centers and other retail
properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 172.6 million square feet of gross leasable area,
or GLA.
Malls typically contain at least one department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers
with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter
of the parking area. Our 94 malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 270,000 to
2.7 million square feet of GLA.
Premium Outlets generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in open-air
centers. Our 69 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately 150,000 to 900,000 square feet of GLA. The
Premium Outlets are generally located within a close proximity to major metropolitan areas and/or tourist destinations.
The 14 properties in The Mills generally range in size from 1.2 million to 2.4 million square feet of GLA and are
located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, big box retailers and
entertainment uses.
We also have interests in six lifestyle centers and 13 other retail properties. The lifestyle centers range in size
from 170,000 to 950,000 square feet of GLA. The other retail properties range in size from approximately 200,000 to
1.6 million square feet of GLA and are considered non-core to our business model.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 94.9% of the owned GLA in malls and Premium Outlets was leased
and approximately 98.2% of the owned GLA for The Mills was leased.
We wholly own 130 of our properties, effectively control 11 properties in which we have a joint venture interest,
and hold the remaining 55 properties through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-
managing general partner or member of 188 properties in the United States. Certain of our joint venture properties
are subject to various rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, put and call rights, or other sale or marketing rights for
partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. We and our partners in these
joint ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions) which may result
in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings, or the use of Operating Partnership units,
to acquire the joint venture interest from our partner.
We own an 80% noncontrolling interest in TRG, which has an interest in 20 regional, super-regional, and outlet
malls in the U.S. Our effective ownership in these properties, through our investment in TRG, ranges from 38.8% to
80%.

Sustainability
Simon has integrated sustainability initiatives into our business operations: how we plan, develop, and operate
our properties.
Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is a central commitment to reducing our environmental impact.  In
2020, we announced the adoption of 2035 greenhouse gas emissions targets approved by the Science Based Target
Initiative (“SBTi”). Our target is to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 68% (2019 baseline), and scope 3
emissions by 20.9% (2018 baseline). We believe that our climate related risk disclosures are aligned with the
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures established by the Financial Stability
Board. 
Reducing water consumption and landfill waste are also components of reducing our carbon and
environmental footprint. We have already achieved our initial target of reducing water usage by 20%, and we are
working to create a new target that will focus on more efficient and responsible water use in the future. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors (“Board”) has been allocated the
oversight of our sustainability policies, including environmental, social, and governance matters.  Additionally, the
Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the oversight and the annual disclosure of our sustainability programs in
the form of an annual sustainability report.
In 2022, we were once again awarded a Green Star rating (2014-2022) - the highest designation awarded for
leadership in sustainability performance by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark. We were also the
recipient of NAREIT’s Leader in the Light® award for sustainability leadership in the retail property sector. Finally, we
scored an A- on the CDP Climate Change questionnaire.
To learn more about our sustainability initiatives and detailed reporting please access our latest Sustainability
Report at investors.simon.com/.  Information in the Sustainability Report and our Company website is not
incorporated herein by reference and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

59Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue
Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less
than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership
subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. In this discussion, unless stated otherwise or
the context otherwise requires, references to "Simon" mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the
"Operating Partnership" mean Simon Property Group, L.P.  References to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively
Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating
Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to
pay all expenses of Simon.
We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which
consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, and The Mills®. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or held an interest
in 196 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 94 malls, 69 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills,
six lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 80% noncontrolling
interest in The Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet
malls in the U.S. and Asia. In addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of
anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at several properties in the North America, Europe and Asia.
Internationally, as of December 31, 2022, we had ownership in 34 Premium Outlets and Designer Outlet properties
primarily located in Asia, Europe, and Canada. As of December 31, 2022, we also owned a 22.4% equity stake in
Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in,
shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe.
We generate the majority of our lease income from retail, dining, entertainment, and other tenants including
consideration received from:
●fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (CAM) reimbursements, and
●variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants’ sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate
taxes, utilities, marketing and certain other items.
Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management
fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.
We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows
and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing
the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the
following:
●attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,
●expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,
●selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,
●generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate
alliances, and
●selling selective non-core assets.
We also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:
●establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and
consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the
sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives,
business development, sponsorship, and events,
Table of Contents
60●offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility
services, and the provision of energy services,
●selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as “outlots” or “outparcels,” and
●generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related
entities.
We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties
to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our
risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by
existing retail outlet properties.
We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our
international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international
investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.
To support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:
●provide the capital necessary to fund growth,
●maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, including but not
limited to, having in place, the Operating Partnership’s $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the
Credit Facility, its $3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or its Supplemental Facility,
together, the Credit Facilities and its global unsecured commercial paper note program, or the Commercial
Paper program, of $2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof, and
●manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.
We consider FFO, comparable FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and portfolio NOI to be key measures of
operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and
provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most
comparable GAAP measures are included below in this discussion.
COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a
global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic had
a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world. The impact of the COVID-19
pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities, including where we own or hold interests in
properties, have at times imposed measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of
movement, group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures,
quarantines, stay-at-home, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. As a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic and these measures, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience
material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in our assessment of the
probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated
by our properties and investments.  Due to certain restrictive governmental orders placed on us, our domestic
portfolio lost approximately 13,500 shopping days in 2020, the majority of which occurred in the second quarter.
As we developed and implemented our response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions
intended to prevent its spread on our business, our primary focus has been on the health and safety of our
employees, our shoppers and the communities in which we serve.  In the second quarter of 2020, in connection with
the property closures, we implemented a series of actions to reduce costs and increase liquidity in light of the
economic impacts of the pandemic, including:
●significantly reduced all non-essential corporate spending,
●significantly reduced property operating expenses, including discretionary marketing spend,
●implemented a temporary furlough of certain corporate and field employees due to the closure of the
Company’s U.S. properties as a result of restrictive governmental orders; reduced certain corporate and
field personnel and implemented a temporary freeze on company hiring efforts, and
Table of Contents
61●suspended more than $1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects.
As the economic environment has recovered from the pandemic, our operations have returned to more
normalized pre-pandemic levels with respect to our operating expenses and capital spend.  
Results Overview
Diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased $0.32 during 2022 to $6.52 as compared
to $6.84 in 2021. The decrease in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable
to:
●a non-cash gain in 2021 on acquisitions and disposals of $203.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share/unit,
related to the disposition of our interest in three properties of $176.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share/unit,
a non-cash gain on the consolidation of one property of $3.7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share/unit, and
net gains of $21.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share/unit, related to property insurance recoveries of
previously depreciated assets, primarily due to hurricane, flood and wind storm damage,
●a gain in 2021 on the disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests of $178.7 million, or $0.48 per
diluted share/unit, of which $159.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted share/unit, was non-cash,
●decreased income from unconsolidated entities of $134.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share/unit, the
majority of which is due to unfavorable year-over-year operations from our other platform investments as
well as the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability at Klépierre in 2021 resulting in a non-
cash gain, of which our share was $118.4 million, which is partially offset by improved operations and core
fundamentals in our other unconsolidated entities and TRG,
●an unrealized unfavorable change in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments of $53.1 million, or
$0.14 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by
●a non-cash gain in 2022 on the disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net of $121.2 million,
or $0.32 per diluted share/unit,
●decreased tax expense of $73.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to unfavorable year-
over-year operations from other platform investments and a favorable $32.0 million tax impact created by
the lower gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests transactions noted above,
●decreased interest expense in 2022 of $34.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to the
early extinguishment of nine secured loans in the fourth quarter of 2021, the disposition of three retail
properties in 2021, and the refinancing of two retail properties at lower interest rates in 2021, partially offset
by an increase in interest rates as further discussed below,
●a charge on early extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share/unit, in 2021, and
●improved operating performance and solid core business fundamentals in 2022, as discussed below, and
the impact of our acquisition, development and expansion activity.
Portfolio NOI increased 5.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021. Average base minimum rent for U.S. Malls and
Premium Outlets increased 2.3% to $55.13 psf as of December 31, 2022, from $53.91 psf as of December 31, 2021.
Ending occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 1.5% to 94.9% as of December 31, 2022, from
93.4% as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to leasing activity, partially offset by 2021 tenant bankruptcy activity.
Our effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2022 on our consolidated indebtedness increased 36
basis points to 3.22% as compared to 2.86% at December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase
in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 273 basis points (3.93% at December 31, 2022 as
compared to 1.20% at December 31, 2021) offset by a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate
debt of 13 basis points (3.15% at December 31, 2022 as compared to 3.28% at December 31, 2021).  The weighted
average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 7.5 years and 7.8 years at December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.
Our financing activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 included:
●increasing our Euro denominated borrowings by €750.0 million ($779.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent as of
the issuance date) under the Supplemental Facility, and using the proceeds to repay €750.0 million ($777.1
million U.S. dollar equivalent as of the payoff date) of senior unsecured notes at maturity,
Table of Contents
62●decreasing our borrowings under the Operating Partnership’s global unsecured commercial paper note
program, or the Commercial Paper program, by $500.0 million, and
●completing on January 11, 2022, the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: $500 million with a
floating interest rate of SOFR plus 43 basis points and $700 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.650%,
with maturity dates of January 11, 2024 and February 1, 2032, respectively. The proceeds were used to
repay $1.05 billion outstanding under the Supplemental Facility, on January 12, 2022.  
United States Portfolio Data
The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy,
and average base minimum rent per square foot. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of
acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. For comparative information purposes, we
separate the information related to The Mills and TRG from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any
information for properties located outside the United States.
The following table sets forth these key operating statistics for the combined U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets:
●properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements,
●properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and

Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot.  Ending occupancy is the
percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all
company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation.
Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all
tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.
Current Leasing Activities
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we signed 1,262 new leases and 1,517 renewal leases
(excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less)
with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 9.1 million
square feet, of which 7.0 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During 2021, we signed 992 new
leases and 1,460 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 8.3 million square feet, of
which 6.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new
leases was $55.41 per square foot in 2022 and $55.90 per square foot in 2021 with an average tenant allowance on
new leases of $53.01 per square foot

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates
and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances
relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been
applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our
estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results,
adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting
policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates
about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
●We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties
and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over
the terms of the leases, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line
rent receivable, is probable of collection. Our assessment of collectability incorporates available operational
performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as other publicly available
information with respect to our tenant’s financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, including declines
in such conditions due to, or amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic.  When a tenant seeks to reorganize its
operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances including,
among other things, the timing of a tenant’s bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumption by the
tenant in bankruptcy proceeding of leases at the Company’s properties on substantially similar terms.  In
the event that we determine accrued receivables are not probable of collection, lease income will be
recorded on a cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and straight-line rent receivable
charged as a direct write-off against lease income in the period of the change in our collectability
determination.  
●We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate
events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not
be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, changes in a property’s operational
performance such as declining cash flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the Company’s intent
and ability to hold the related asset, and, if applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing
arrangements. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted
operating income before depreciation and amortization during the anticipated holding period plus its
residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we
charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over our estimate of its fair value. We also
review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate whether
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our investments may not be
recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investments are less
than their carrying value and such impairment is other-than-temporary. Our evaluation of changes in
economic or operating conditions and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary may include
developing estimates of fair value, forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and
amortization. We estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data
such as operating income, hold periods, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or
Table of Contents
64relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information and whether certain impairments
are other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the
financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur
subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the
assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions
regarding those investments differ from actual results.
●To maintain Simon’s status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income in any given
year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may
potentially impact Simon’s REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain Simon’s REIT status,
and available relief provisions do not apply, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes at
regular corporate income tax rates during the period Simon did not qualify as a REIT. If Simon lost its REIT
status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which
qualification was lost unless its failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met.
As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense
recorded and paid during those periods.
●In the period of a significant acquisition of real estate, we make estimates as part of our valuation of the
purchase price of asset acquisitions (including the components of excess investment in joint ventures) to
the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component. The most
significant components of our real estate valuations are typically the determination of relative fair value to
the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings
and fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the
amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or
the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of
the tenants’ ability to pay rents based upon the tenants’ operating performance at the property, including the
competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost
for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we
will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.  
Results of Operations
The following acquisitions, dispositions, and openings of consolidated properties affected our consolidated

For the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and
the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the above transactions are referred to as the property transactions. In
the following discussions of our results of operations, “comparable” refers to properties we owned and operated in
both years in the year to year comparisons.
Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2021
Lease income increased $168.5 million, of which the property transactions accounted for a $23.2 million
decrease.  Comparable lease income increased $191.7 million, or 4.1%.  Total lease income increased primarily due
to an increase in fixed lease income of $156.6 million primarily due to an increase in fixed minimum lease
consideration, higher occupancy, and an increase in variable lease income of $11.9 million primarily related to higher
consideration based on tenant sales.  
Total other income decreased $4.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in lease settlement income of $38.8
million, a $14.9 million gain from the sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property in 2021, and a $6.8
million non-cash dilution gain on a non-retail investment in 2021, partially offset by an $20.8 million increase in fee
and other income, a $17.9 million increase related to Simon Brand Ventures and gift card revenues, a $9.8 million
increase related to land sale activity and a $7.8 million increase in interest income.
Property operating expenses increased $48.4 million primarily due to the return to a more normalized
operating environment following the peak of the COVID pandemic.
Other expense increased $11.7 million primarily due to an increase in legal fees and foreign currency
revaluations.
Interest expense decreased $34.5 million primarily related to the early extinguishment of nine secured loans,
the disposition of three retail properties, and the refinancing of two retail properties at lower interest rates in 2021,
partially

During 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million as a result of the early redemption
of unsecured notes and the payoff of mortgages at nine properties.
During 2022, we recorded a $159.0 million non-cash gain as a result of the sale to ABG of all of our interests
in the Eddie Bauer licensing venture for additional interests in ABG, partially offset by a loss of $37.8 million on the
revaluation or disposal of other investments. During 2021, we recorded a non-cash gain of $159.8 million as a result
of the sale to ABG of all of our interests in the licensing ventures of Forever 21 and Brooks Brothers for additional
interests in ABG and a gain on the sale of a portion of our interest in ABG of $18.8 million, as discussed further in
Note 6.
Income and other tax expense decreased $73.7 million due to the impact in 2021 on deferred tax expense as
a result of the ABG transaction noted above, which had a non-cash tax impact of $55.9 million, offset by the impact in
2022 on deferred tax expense of the 2022 ABG transaction noted above, which had a non-cash tax impact of $39.7
million, and lower tax expense in 2022 on our share of operating results from our other platform investments.
Income from unconsolidated entities decreased $134.9 million primarily due to unfavorable results of
operations year over year from our other platform investments of $216.1 million, as well as the reversal in 2021 of a
previously established deferred tax liability at Klépierre resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was $118.4
million, partially offset by favorable year over year results of operations across the properties and TRG in 2022.
During 2022, we recorded a $19.9 million gain on the disposition of one unconsolidated property, a $2.1
million gain related to excess insurance proceeds and a $1.3 million gain on the disposition of certain assets by
Klépierre, partially offset by a $17.7 million loss primarily related to the disposition of one consolidated property.
 During 2021, we recorded gains of $184.0 million related to the disposition of three consolidated properties, our
interest in one unconsolidated property and the impact from the consolidation of one property that was previously
unconsolidated, and gains of $21.2 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets.
Simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $6.2 million due to a decrease in the net
income of the Operating Partnership.
Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2020
Lease income increased $434.4 million, of which the property transactions accounted for a $17.6 million
decrease.  Comparable lease income increased $452.0 million, or 10.6%.  Total lease income increased primarily due
to an increase in variable lease income of $603.8 million primarily related to higher consideration based on tenant
sales and lower negative variable lease income due to abatements granted in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, partially offset by decreases in fixed minimum lease and CAM consideration recorded on a straight-line
basis of $169.4 million.  
Total other income increased $65.3 million, primarily due to an increase in lease settlement income of $39.8
million, a $14.9 million gain on the sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property, an $11.5 million increase
related to Simon Brand Ventures and gift card revenues, a $6.8 million increase from the non-cash dilution gain on a
non-retail investment, and a $3.3 million net increase in dividend, interest and other income, partially offset by a $7.8
million decrease related to higher land and outparcel sale activity in 2020, and a $3.2 million decrease related to
business interruption proceeds received in 2020.
Property operating expenses increased $66.6 million primarily due to the reopening of properties that had
been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to prevent
its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.
Repairs and maintenance expenses increased $15.5 million primarily due to the reopening of properties that
had been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to
prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.
Advertising and promotion expenses increased $15.7 million primarily due to the reopening of properties that
had been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to
prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts.
General and administrative expense increased $7.8 million primarily due to an increase in compensation.
Other expense increased $2.8 million primarily due to an increase in the write-off of development projects we
are no longer intending to pursue, partially offset by a decrease related to legal fees.

67During 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million as a result of the early redemption
of unsecured notes and the payoff of mortgages at nine properties.
During 2021, we recorded gains on sale or exchange of equity interests of $178.7 million as a result of the
contribution to ABG of all of our interests in the licensing ventures of Forever 21 and Brooks Brothers in exchange for
additional interests in ABG and the sale of a portion of our interest in ABG, as discussed further in Note 6.
Income and other tax (expense) benefit increased $161.8 million due to increased deferred tax expense as a
result of the ABG transactions noted above which had a non-cash tax impact of $55.9 million and $92.1 million
related to strong operating performance of our other platform investments as well as earnings from our acquisition of
an interest in certain retailers throughout 2020.
Income from unconsolidated entities increased $563.0 million primarily due to favorable results of operations
from our other platform investments, including earnings from our acquisition of an interest in J.C. Penney in the later
part of 2020, and international investments which included the reversal of a previously established deferred tax
liability at Klépierre resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was $118.4 million, partially offset by amortization
of our excess investment in TRG.
During 2021, we recorded gains of $184.0 million related to the disposition of three consolidated properties,
our interest in one unconsolidated property and the impact from the consolidation of one property that was previously
unconsolidated, and gains of $21.2 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets.
 During 2020, we recorded $125.6 million of impairment charges related to one consolidated property, an other-than-
temporary impairment on our equity investment in three joint venture properties, an other-than-temporary impairment
to reduce an investment to its estimated fair value, and a $4.3 million loss, net, related to the impairment and
disposition of certain assets by Klépierre, partially offset by a $12.3 million gain on the disposal of our interest in one
consolidated property, a $1.9 million excess gain on insurance proceeds related to our two properties in Puerto Rico
and a $1.0 million gain related to the disposition of a shopping center by one of our joint venture investments.
Simon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $154.3 million due to an increase in the
net income of the Operating Partnership.    
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed
rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised 9.0% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2022. We also enter into
interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity
from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled
$4.2 billion in the aggregate during 2022. The Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative
sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be
increased as discussed further below.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $87.7 million during 2022 to $621.6 million as of
December 31, 2022 as further discussed below.
On December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $6.6 billion under
the Facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of $927.8 million and letters of credit of $10.0 million. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Credit Facilities was $1.2 billion and the
weighted average outstanding balance was $260.7 million. The weighted average interest rate was 2.15% for the
year ended December 31, 2022.
Simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had
access to private and public, short and long-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private
equity from institutional investors at the property level.
Our business model and Simon’s status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise
funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from
time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient
cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program to address our debt
maturities and capital needs through 2023.
Table of Contents
68Cash Flows
Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled
$4.2 billion during 2022. In addition, we had net repayments of debt from our debt financing and repayment activities
of $0.3 billion in 2022. These activities are further discussed below under “Financing and Debt.” During 2022, we
also:
●funded the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest in Jamestown for cash consideration of $173.4 million,
●paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling approximately $2.6 billion and preferred unit
distributions totaling $5.3 million,
●funded consolidated capital expenditures of $650.0 million (including development and other costs of
$108.2 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $282.5 million, and tenant costs and other
operational capital expenditures of $259.3 million),
●funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $235.8 million, and
●funded the repurchase of $180.4 million of Simon’s common stock.
In general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses,
monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders and/or distributions to partners
necessary to maintain Simon’s REIT qualification on a long-term basis.  In addition, we expect to be able to generate
or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and
expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from the following, however a
severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital
markets, may affect our ability to access necessary capital:
●excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,
●borrowings on the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program,
●additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or
●additional equity raised in the public or private markets.
We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2023, and we consider these projected cash flows
in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant
deterioration in projected cash flows from operations, could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from
the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program, further curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other
additional sources of financing.
Financing and Debt
Unsecured Debt
At December 31, 2022, our unsecured debt consisted of $18.6 billion of senior unsecured notes of the
Operating Partnership, $125.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, and $802.8 million (U.S. dollar equivalent)
of Euro-denominated borrowings outstanding under the Supplemental Facility.  
The Credit Facility also included an additional single, delayed-draw $2.0 billion term loan facility, or Term
Facility, or together with the Credit Facility and the Supplemental Facility, the Credit Facilities, which the Operating
Partnership drew on December 15, 2020, and repaid in 2021.
The Credit Facility can be increased in the form of additional commitments in an aggregate not to exceed $1.0
billion, for a total aggregate size of $5.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying
certain customary conditions precedent.  Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Pounds,
Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to
95% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Credit Facility is June 30,
2024. The Credit Facility can be extended for two additional six-month periods to June 30, 2025, at our sole option,
subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans,
the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate,
(y) for

Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily
SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of
between 0.650% and 1.400% or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to
the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one
month plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000%
and 0.400%. The Credit Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.100%
and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility.  Based upon our current credit ratings,
the interest rate on the Credit Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the
transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
The Supplemental Facility’s borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion may be increased to $4.5 billion during its term
and provides for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Pounds, Sterling, Canadian dollars and
Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to 100% of the maximum revolving
credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Supplemental Facility is January 31, 2026 and can be
extended for an additional year to January 31, 2027 at our sole option, subject to satisfying certain customary
conditions precedent.
Borrowings under the Supplemental Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark
Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted
TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated
in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating

(which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term
SOFR Rate for one month plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of
between 0.000% and 0.400%. The Supplemental Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit
rating of between 0.100% and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Supplemental Facility.
 Based upon our current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points,
plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
On December 31, 2022 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $6.6 billion under the Facilities.
The maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Facilities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was
$1.2 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $260.7 million. Letters of credit of $10.0 million were
outstanding under the Facilities as of December 31, 2022.
The Operating Partnership also has available a Commercial Paper program of $2.0 billion, or the non-U.S.
dollar equivalent thereof. The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in
U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more
subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  Notes will be sold under
customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result
of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the Operating Partnership's other unsecured senior indebtedness.
 The Commercial Paper program is supported by the Credit Facilities, and if necessary or appropriate, we may make
one or more draws under either of the Credit Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the
Commercial Paper program. On December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance under the Commercial Paper
program.  Borrowings under the Commercial Paper program reduce amounts otherwise available under the Credit
Facilities.
On January 21, 2021 the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured
notes: $800 million with a fixed interest rate of 1.750%, and $700 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.20%, with
maturity dates of February 2028 and 2031, respectively.
On January 27, 2021 the Operating Partnership completed the planned optional redemption of its $550 million

March 19, 2033, the proceeds of which were used on March 23, 2021 to repay the remaining $1.25 billion under the
Term Facility reducing it to zero.

70On August 18, 2021, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured
notes: $550 million with a fixed interest rate of 1.375%, and $700 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.250%, with
maturity dates of January 15, 2027, and 2032, respectively.

as a result on the optional redemptions.
On December 14, 2021, the Operating Partnership drew $1.05 billion under the Supplemental Facility, the
proceeds of which funded the early extinguishment of 9 mortgages with a principal balance of $1.16 billion. We
recorded a $20.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of this transaction.
On January 11, 2022, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of the following senior unsecured
notes: $500 million with a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 43 basis points, and $700 million with a fixed interest
rate of 2.650%, with maturity dates of January 11, 2024 and February 1, 2032, respectively. The proceeds were used
to repay $1.05 billion outstanding under the Supplemental Facility on January 12, 2022.
On November 16, 2022, the Operating Partnership drew €750.0 million ($779.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent)
under the Supplemental Facility and used the proceeds on November 17, 2022 to repay €750.0 million ($777.1
million U.S. dollar equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at maturity.
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership completed interest rate swap agreements with
a combined notional value at €750.0 million to swap the interest rate of the Euro denominated borrowings outstanding
under the Supplemental Facility to an all-in fixed rate of 3.81%. This interest rate swap matures on January 17, 2024.
Mortgage Debt
Total mortgage indebtedness was $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Covenants
Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. If we were to
fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be
accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender, including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As
of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.
At December 31, 2022, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 38 non-recourse mortgage
notes secured by mortgages on 41 properties and other assets, including two separate pools of cross-defaulted and
cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default
under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool
and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt
instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as
collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply
with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At December
31, 2022, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants
where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

options, unless reasonably certain of exercise.
Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common
in the real estate industry and are described in Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our joint
ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured non-recourse debt financings obtained by and in the name
of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture
partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates
expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. As of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint
venture-related mortgage indebtedness of $128.0 million. Mortgages guaranteed by the Operating Partnership are
secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and
which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint
venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or
partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.
Hurricane Impacts
As discussed further in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, during the third quarter
of 2017, two of our wholly-owned properties located in Puerto Rico sustained significant property damage and
business interruption as a result of Hurricane Maria.  
Since the date of the loss, we have received $84.0 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers
related to the two properties located in Puerto Rico, of which $48.3 million was used for property restoration and
remediation and to reduce the insurance recovery receivable.  During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,
we recorded $2.1 million
Table of Contents
72and $5.2 million, respectively, as business interruption income, which was recorded in other income in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  
During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Texas experienced property damage and
business interruption as a result of Hurricane Hanna.  We wrote-off assets of approximately $9.6 million, and
recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $14.0 million of insurance proceeds from third-party
carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery
receivable.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $3.5 million gain related to property insurance
recovery of previously depreciated assets.  This amount was recorded in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling
interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net.
During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Louisiana experienced property damage and
business interruption as a result of Hurricane Laura.   We wrote-off assets of approximately $11.1 million and
recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $27.5 million of insurance proceeds from third-party
carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery
receivable.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $17.5 million gain related to property
insurance recovery of previously depreciated assets.  This amount was recorded in gain (loss) on acquisition of
controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and
impairment, net.  
Acquisitions and Dispositions
Buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements.
Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our
partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar
restrictions). If we determine it is in our best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we
have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these
provisions or elect to buy our partner’s interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use
the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion
opportunities.
Acquisitions.  On June 17, 2022, we acquired an additional interest in Gloucester Premium Outlets from a
joint venture partner for $14.0 million in cash consideration, including a pro-rata share of working capital, resulting in
the consolidation of this property. The property is subject to an $85.7 million 3.29% variable rate mortgage loan. We
accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and substantially all of our investment has been determined to
relate to investment property.
The Company sponsored, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, a special purpose acquisition corporation, or
SPAC, named Simon Property Group Acquisition Holdings, Inc. On February 18, 2021 the SPAC announced the
pricing of its initial public offering, which was consummated on February 23, 2021, generating gross proceeds of
$345.0 million.  The SPAC was a consolidated VIE which was formed for the purpose of effecting a business
combination and was targeting innovative businesses that operate within Simon’s “Live, Work, Play, Stay, Shop”
ecosystem.  
In January 2020, we acquired additional interests of 5.05% and 1.37% in SPARC Group and ABG,
respectively, for $6.7 million and $33.5 million, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, SPARC acquired certain
assets and operations of Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brands out of bankruptcy. At September 30, 2020, our
noncontrolling equity method interests in the operations venture of SPARC Group and in ABG were 50.0% and 6.8%,
respectively.
Dispositions.  We may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic
criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area.
In December 2022, the SPAC was liquidated and dissolved.  In connection with this event, we recorded a loss
of $10.2 million, representing our sponsor investment in the SPAC.
During 2022, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. The proceeds from this
transaction were $59.0 million, resulting in a loss of $15.6 million. We also recorded a non-cash gain of $19.9 million
related to the disposition of one unconsolidated retail property in satisfaction of its $99.6 million non-recourse
mortgage loan. These are included in a gain on acquisitions of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on,
assets and interest in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive income.
During 2021, we recorded net gains of $176.8 million primarily related to disposition activity which included the
foreclosure of three consolidated retail properties in satisfaction of their respective $180.0 million, $120.9 million and
$100.0
Table of Contents
73million non-recourse mortgage loans. We also disposed of our interest in an unconsolidated property resulting in a
gain of $3.4 million.      
Joint Venture Formation Activity and Other Investment Activity
On December 19, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a 50% noncontrolling legal ownership interest in
Jamestown, a global real estate investment and asset management company, as well as separate interests in certain
real estate and working capital, for total cash consideration of $173.4 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we sold to ABG our interests in the licensing venture of Eddie Bauer for
additional interests in ABG. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain of
$159.0 million, representing the difference between the fair value of the interests received and the $98.8 million
carrying value of the intellectual property licensing venture less costs to sell. On July 1, 2021, we sold to ABG all of
our interests in both the Forever 21 and Brooks Brothers licensing ventures for additional interests in ABG. As a
result, in the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain of $159.8 million, representing the
difference between the fair value of the interests received and the $102.7 million carrying value of the intellectual
property licensing ventures less costs to sell. On December 20, 2021, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG,
resulting in a pre-tax gain of $18.8 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded tax expense of $8.0 million
which is included in income and other tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income. Subsequently, we acquired additional interests in ABG for cash consideration of $100.0
million. At December 31, 2022, our interest in ABG was approximately 12.3%.
During the first quarter of 2022, SPARC Group acquired certain assets and operations of Reebok and entered
into a long-term strategic partnership with ABG to become the core licensee and operating partner for Reebok in the
United States.
On June 1, 2021, we and our partner, ABG, acquired the intellectual property of Eddie Bauer. Our
noncontrolling interest in the licensing venture is 49% and was acquired for cash consideration of $100.8 million.
In the first quarter of 2021, we and our partner, ABG, each acquired additional 12.5% interests in the licensing
and operations of Forever 21, our share of which was $56.3 million, bringing our interest to 50%. Subsequently the
Forever 21 operations were merged into SPARC Group.
On December 29, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in TRG, which has an
ownership interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Under the terms of the
transaction, we, through the Operating Partnership, acquired all of Taubman Centers, Inc. common stock for $43.00
per share in cash. Total consideration for the acquisition, including the redemption of Taubman’s $192.5 million 6.5%
Series J Cumulative Preferred Shares and its $170.0 million 6.25% Series K Cumulative Preferred Shares, and the
issuance of 955,705 Operating Partnership units, was approximately $3.5 billion.  Our investment includes the 6.38%
Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for $362.5 million issued to us.
On December 7, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of J.C. Penney, a
department store retailer, out of bankruptcy. Our noncontrolling interest in the venture is 41.67% and was acquired for
cash consideration of $125.0 million.
On February 19, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of Forever 21, a
retailer of apparel and accessories, out of bankruptcy. The interests were acquired through two separate joint
ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture. Our noncontrolling interest in each of the retail operations
venture and in the licensing venture is 37.5%. Our aggregate investment in the ventures was $67.6 million. In
connection with the acquisition of our interest, the Forever 21 joint venture recorded a non-cash bargain purchase
gain of which our share of $35.0 million pre-tax is included in income from unconsolidated entities in the consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income.
During 2020, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. A portion of the gross proceeds
on this transaction of $33.4 million was used to partially repay a cross-collateralized mortgage. Our share of the $12.3
million gain is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated
entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.  
Development Activity
We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our
properties. Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and
restaurants are underway at several properties in North America, Europe, and Asia.
Table of Contents
74Construction continues on certain redevelopment and new development projects in the U.S. and
internationally that are nearing completion.  Our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment and
expansion projects currently under construction is approximately $980 million.  Simon’s share of remaining net cash
funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is
approximately $239 million.  We expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. We seek a
stabilized return on invested capital in the range of 7-10% for all of our new development, expansion and
redevelopment projects.
Summary of Capital Expenditures.  The following table summarizes total capital expenditures on
consolidated properties on a cash basis (in millions):
    2022     2021     2020  
New Developments $  108 $  96 $  27
Redevelopments and Expansions   283   300   399

Operational Capital Expenditures   52   5  5
Total $  650 $  528 $  484
International Development Activity  
We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international
development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to
changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated
borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. Our consolidated net income exposure
to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Peso, Won, and other foreign currencies is not material. We expect our
share of estimated committed capital for international development projects to be completed with projected delivery in
2023 or 2024 is $199 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.
The following table describes recently completed and new development and expansion projects as well as our

Dividends, Distributions and Stock Repurchase Program
Simon paid a common stock dividend of $1.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $6.90 per share for
the year ended December 31, 2022. The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts. In
2021, Simon paid dividends of $1.65 and $7.15 per share for the three and twelve month periods ended December
31, 2021, respectively. The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts. On February 6,
2023, Simon’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2023 of $1.80 per share,
payable on March 31, 2023 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2023.  The distribution rate on units is equal to
the dividend rate on common stock. In order to maintain its status as a REIT, Simon must pay a minimum amount of
dividends. Simon’s future dividends and the Operating Partnership’s future distributions will be determined by Simon’s
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, based on actual and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of
operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for
capital and operating expenditures, financing covenants, if any, and the amount required to maintain Simon’s status
as a REIT.
On May 9, 2022, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan.  Under the plan,
Simon may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period commencing on May 16,
2022 and ending
Table of Contents
75on May 16, 2024 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant.  During the
year ended December 31, 2022, Simon purchased 1,830,022 shares at an average price of $98.57 per share.  As
Simon repurchases shares under this program, the Operating Partnership repurchases an equal number of units from
Simon.
On February 11, 2019, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan.  Under the
plan, Simon was authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period ending
February 11, 2021 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warranted.  During
the year ended December 31, 2020, Simon purchased 1,245,654 shares at an average price of $122.50 per share.
 As Simon repurchased shares under this program, the Operating Partnership repurchased an equal number of units
from Simon.  
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements made in this press release may be deemed "forward–looking statements" within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations
reflected in any forward–looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no
assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that the Company's actual results may differ
materially from those indicated by these forward–looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other
factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely
affect the general retail environment, including but not limited to those caused by inflation, recessionary pressures,
wars, such as in Ukraine, and supply chain disruptions; the inability to renew leases and relet vacant space at
existing properties on favorable terms; the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants; the inability to collect rent
due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; an increase in vacant space at our properties; the
potential for violence, civil unrest, criminal activity or terrorist activities at our properties;  natural disasters; the
availability of comprehensive insurance coverage; the intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry,
including e-commerce; security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure; the
increased focus on ESG metrics and reporting; environmental liabilities; our international activities subjecting us to
risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations, including changes in
foreign exchange rates; our continued ability to maintain our status as a REIT; changes in tax laws or regulations that
result in adverse tax consequences; risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment, expansion,
leasing and management of properties; the inability to lease newly developed properties on favorable terms; the loss
of key management personnel; uncertainties regarding the impact of pandemics, epidemics or public health crises,
and the associated governmental restrictions on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
liquidity; changes in market rates of interest; the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations,
including covenants in the governing agreements that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate
freely; any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and
satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements; any change in our credit rating; risks relating to our joint venture
properties, including guarantees of certain joint venture indebtedness; and general risks related to real estate
investments, including the illiquidity of real estate investments. The Company discusses these and other risks and
uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part 1, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company
may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports, but except as required by law, the Company
undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future developments, or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as FFO,
comparable FFO, diluted FFO per share, NOI, and portfolio NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are
helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a
relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating
performance of our portfolio.
We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“NAREIT”) Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement.  Our main business includes acquiring,
owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate.  Gains and
losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in FFO.  We determine FFO to be our share of
consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP:
●excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization,
●excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items,
●excluding gains and losses from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment
related to, depreciable retail operating properties,
Table of Contents
76●plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership
interest, and
●all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
You should understand that our computations of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to
similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP measures:
●do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
●should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a
measure of operating performance, and
●are not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
The following schedule reconciles total FFO and comparable FFO to consolidated net income and, for Simon,
diluted net income per share to diluted FFO per share.

78Item 7A.  Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations.
We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest
rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We are also exposed to foreign
currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the
underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures. We do not enter
into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes.
We may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of anticipated issuances of senior notes. Upon completion
of the debt issuance, the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.
Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent
market rates of interest, primarily SOFR and LIBOR. Based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at
December 31, 2022, a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $11.5 million, and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $721.7 million.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Simon Property Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Simon
Property Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Simon Property Group, Inc. (the
Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related
notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated
financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on
the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
    Evaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment
Description of the
MatterAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s consolidated net investment properties totaled $21.8
billion. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews
investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of an investment property
may not be recoverable. The Company estimates undiscounted cash flows of an investment
property using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash
flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated capitalization rates,
leasing prospects and local market information.
Table of Contents
81Auditing management’s evaluation of investment properties for impairment was complex due
to the estimation uncertainty in determining the undiscounted cash flows of an investment
property. In particular, the impairment evaluation for investment properties was sensitive to
significant assumptions such as forecasted cash flows and operating income before
depreciation and amortization, and capitalization rates, all of which can be affected by
expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition.
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness
of controls over the Company’s process for evaluating investment properties for impairment,
including controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above.
To test the Company’s evaluation of investment properties for impairment, we performed audit
procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the
significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the
underlying data used by management in its analysis. We compared the significant
assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, relevant market
information, and other applicable sources. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in
evaluating certain assumptions. In addition, we compared the forecasted cash flows and
operating income before depreciation and amortization to historical actual results and
evaluated significant variances, including consideration of the current economic environment.
As part of our evaluation, we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates
and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the
undiscounted cash flows of the related investment property that would result from changes in
the assumptions.
Evaluation of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for Impairment
Description of the
MatterAt December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated
entities and its investments in Klépierre and TRG totaled $8.1 billion. As explained in Note 3
to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews investments in unconsolidated
entities for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an investment in an unconsolidated entity may not be recoverable. To identify and evaluate
whether an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying
value has occurred, the Company assesses economic and operating conditions that may
affect the fair value of the investment. The evaluation of operating conditions may include
developing estimates of forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and
amortization to support the recoverability of the carrying amount of the investment. When
required, the Company estimates the fair value of an investment and assesses whether any
impairment is other than temporary using observable and unobservable inputs such as
historical and forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and
amortization, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing
prospects and local market information.
Auditing management’s evaluation of investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment
was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the forecasted cash flows,
operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated fair value of the investment
and whether any decline in fair value below the related investment’s carrying amount is other-
than-temporary. In particular, the impairment evaluation for these investments was sensitive to
significant assumptions such as forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation
and amortization, relevant market multiples, and capitalization and discount rates, all of which
can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and
competition.
How We Addressed

related investment’s carrying value was other-than-temporary.

971. Organization
Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue
Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less
than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership
subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. Unless stated otherwise or the context
otherwise requires, references to "Simon" mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the "Operating
Partnership" mean Simon Property Group, L.P.  References to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively Simon, the
Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating
Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated, these notes to consolidated financial statements apply to both Simon and
the Operating Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, the Operating
Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon.
We own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which
consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, and The Mills®.  As of December 31, 2022, we owned or held an
interest in 196 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 94 malls, 69 Premium Outlets,
14 Mills, six lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 80%
noncontrolling interest in the Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 24 regional, super-
regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2022, we had ownership interests
in 34 Premium Outlets and Designer Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe, and Canada. As of
December 31, 2022, we also owned a 22.4% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based
real estate company which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe.
We generate the majority of our lease income from retail, dining, entertainment and other tenants including
consideration received from:
●Fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (CAM) reimbursements and,
●Variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants’ sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate
taxes, utilities, marketing, and certain other items.
Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management
fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.
We also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:
●establishing our properties as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and
consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the
sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives,
business development, sponsorship, and events,
●offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility
services, and the provision of energy services,
●selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as “outlots” or “outparcels,” and
●generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related
entities.

982. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all controlled subsidiaries, and
all significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.
We consolidate properties that are wholly-owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control.
Control of a property is demonstrated by, among other factors, our ability to refinance debt and sell the property
without the consent of any other partner or owner and the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.
We also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary.
Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct activities
that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right
to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our determination of the primary
beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other
contractual arrangements. There have been no changes during 2022 in previous conclusions about whether an entity
qualifies as a VIE or whether we are the primary beneficiary of any previously identified VIE. During the periods
presented, we did not provide financial or other support to any identified VIE that we were not contractually obligated
to provide.
Investments in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests. We account
for these unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. We initially record these investments at cost
and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of
the applicable partnership or joint venture agreement, cash contributions and distributions, and foreign currency
fluctuations, if applicable. The allocation provisions in the partnership or joint venture agreements are not always
consistent with the legal ownership interests held by each general or limited partner or joint venture investee primarily
due to partner preferences. We separately report investments in partnerships and joint ventures for which
accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income of the partnerships and joint
ventures within cash distributions and losses in partnerships and joint ventures, at equity in the consolidated balance
sheets. The net equity of certain partnerships and joint ventures is less than zero because of financing or operating
distributions that are usually greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and
amortization.
As of December 31, 2022, we consolidated 130 wholly-owned properties and 18 additional properties that are
less than wholly-owned, but which we control or for which we are the primary beneficiary. We apply the equity method
of accounting to the other 82 properties (the joint venture properties) and our investments in Klépierre (a publicly
traded, Paris-based real estate company), TRG, and Jamestown (a global real estate investment and management
company), as well as our investments (collectively, our other platform investments) in retail operations (J.C. Penney
and SPARC Group); intellectual property and licensing venture (Authentic Brands Group, LLC, or ABG); and an e-
commerce venture (Rue Gilt Groupe, or RGG). We manage the day-to-day operations of 51 of the 82 joint venture
properties, but have determined that our partner or partners have substantive participating rights with respect to the
assets and operations of these joint venture properties. Our investments in joint ventures in Japan, South Korea,
Mexico, Malaysia, Canada, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom comprise 24 of the remaining 31 properties.
These international properties and TRG are managed by joint ventures in which we share control.
Preferred distributions of the Operating Partnership are accrued at declaration and represent distributions on
outstanding preferred units of partnership interests, or preferred units, and are included in net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests.  We allocate net operating results of the Operating Partnership after preferred distributions to
limited partners and to us based on the partners’ respective weighted average ownership interests in the Operating
Partnership. Net operating results of the Operating Partnership attributable to limited partners are reflected in net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Weighted average ownership interest  87.4 %  87.4 %  86.9 %  
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our ownership interest in the Operating Partnership was 87.4%. We
adjust the noncontrolling limited partners’ interest at the end of each period to reflect their interest in the net assets of
the Operating Partnership.
Preferred unit requirements in the Operating Partnership’s accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income represent distributions on outstanding preferred units and are recorded when
declared.    
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Investment Properties
Investment properties consist of the following as of December 31:
    2022     2021  
Land $3,632,943 $3,639,353
Buildings and improvements  34,246,835  33,857,863
Total land, buildings and improvements  37,879,778  37,497,216
Furniture, fixtures and equipment  447,134  435,150
Investment properties at cost  38,326,912  37,932,366
Less — accumulated depreciation  16,563,749  15,621,127
Investment properties at cost, net $21,763,163 $22,311,239
Construction in progress included above $587,644 $797,519
We record investment properties at cost. Investment properties include costs of acquisitions; development,
predevelopment, and construction (including allocable salaries and related benefits); tenant allowances and
improvements; and interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction. We capitalize improvements and
replacements from repair and maintenance when the repair and maintenance extends the useful life, increases
capacity, or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance items are expensed as incurred.
We capitalize interest on projects during periods of construction until the projects are ready for their intended purpose
based on interest rates in place during the construction period. The amount of interest capitalized during each year is
as follows:
For the Year Ended  
December 31,  
    2022 2021    2020
Capitalized interest $35,482 $31,204 $22,917
We record depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over an estimated
original useful life, which is generally 10 to 35 years. We review depreciable lives of investment properties periodically
and we make adjustments when necessary to reflect a shorter economic life. We amortize tenant allowances and
tenant improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the
tenant, if shorter. We record depreciation on equipment and fixtures utilizing the straight-line method over seven to
ten years.
We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate
events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be
recoverable. These

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts
and where indicated as in millions or billions)
100circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in a property’s operational performance, such as declining cash
flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset, and, if
applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing arrangements. We measure any impairment of
investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization during
the anticipated holding period plus its residual value, and, if applicable, on a probability weighted basis, is less than
the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying
value of the property over our estimate of fair value.
We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our investments may not be
recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investment is less than its
carrying value and such impairment is other-than-temporary. Our evaluation of changes in economic or operating
conditions and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary may include developing estimates of fair value,
forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization.
We estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data such as
operating income before depreciation and amortization, hold periods, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or
relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information, expected probabilities of outcomes, if
applicable, and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions
including, changes in the financial condition of our tenants and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related
asset, that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could
impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions
regarding those investments differ from actual results.  
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $34.4 million related to one
consolidated property, which is included in Gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or
recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income.  During the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-
temporary impairment charge of $55.2 million, representing our equity method investment balance in three joint
venture properties, which is included in Gain (loss) on  acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or
recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income.  
Purchase Accounting
We allocate the purchase price of asset acquisitions and any excess investment in unconsolidated entities to
the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component which may be
derived from various observable or unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, we may utilize third party valuation
specialists. These components typically include buildings, land and intangibles related to in-place leases and we
estimate:
●the relative fair value of land and related improvements and buildings on an as-if-vacant basis,
●the market value of in-place leases based upon our best estimate of current market rents and amortize the
resulting market rent adjustment into lease income,
●the value of costs to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances and improvements and leasing
commissions, and
●the value of lease income and recovery of costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the
space was vacant.
The relative fair value of buildings is depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or
related improvements. We amortize tenant improvements, in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles
over the remaining life of the underlying leases. We also estimate the value of other acquired intangible assets, if any,
which are amortized over the remaining life of the underlying related intangibles.

101Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash and
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents generally
consist of commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, Eurodollars, repurchase agreements, and money market
deposits or securities. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include our cash
and cash equivalents and our trade accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with institutions of
high credit quality. However, at certain times, such cash and cash equivalents are in excess of Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits. See Notes 4 and 8 for
disclosures about non-cash investing and financing transactions.
Equity Instruments and Debt Securities
Equity instruments and debt securities consist primarily of equity instruments, our deferred compensation plan
investments, the debt securities of our captive insurance subsidiary, and certain investments held to fund the debt
service requirements of debt previously secured by investment properties. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had
equity instruments with readily determinable fair values of $73.0 million and $142.2 million, respectively. Changes in
the fair value of these equity instruments are recorded in unrealized losses in fair value of publicly traded equity
instruments, net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. At December 31, 2022 and
2021, we had equity instruments without readily determinable fair values of $236.2 million and $217.2 million,
respectively, for which we have elected the measurement alternative. We regularly evaluate these investments for
any impairment in their estimated fair value, as well as any observable price changes for an identical or similar equity
instrument of the same issuer. We recorded a reduction in the carrying value of these investments of $27.5 million
and nil for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these equity
instruments are recorded in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net in our consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Our deferred compensation plan equity instruments are valued based upon quoted market prices.  The
investments have a matching liability as the amounts are fully payable to the employees that earned the
compensation.  Changes in value of these securities and changes to the matching liability to employees are both
recognized in earnings and, as a result, there is no impact to consolidated net income.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held debt securities of $52.3 million and $60.9 million, respectively, in our
captive insurance subsidiary. The types of securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive insurance
subsidiary are typically U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government securities as well as corporate debt securities with
maturities ranging from less than one year to ten years. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
valued based upon quoted market prices or other observable inputs when quoted market prices are not available.
The amortized cost of debt securities, which approximates fair value, held by our captive insurance subsidiary is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Changes in the values of these
securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the gain or loss is realized or until
any unrealized loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We review any declines in value of these securities for
other-than-temporary impairment and consider the severity and duration of any decline in value. To the extent an
other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred, an impairment is recorded and a new cost basis is
established.
Our captive insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus as well as
maintain a minimum liquidity ratio. Therefore, our access to these securities may be limited.
Fair Value Measurements
Level 1 fair value inputs are quoted prices for identical items in active, liquid and visible markets such as stock
exchanges. Level 2 fair value inputs are observable information for similar items in active or inactive markets, and
appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations. Level 3 fair value inputs reflect our best
estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability at the measurement
date. The inputs
Table of Contents
Simon Property Group, Inc.
Simon Property Group, L.P.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts
and where indicated as in millions or billions)
102are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation estimate. We have no investments for which fair value
is measured on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.
The equity instruments with readily determinable fair values we held at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
primarily classified as having Level 1 fair value inputs. In addition, we had derivative instruments which were
classified as having Level 2 inputs, which consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate cap
and swap agreements with a gross asset balance of $15.8 million at December 31, 2022 and $6.2 million at
December 31, 2021, and a gross liability balance of $8.6 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
Note 7 includes a discussion of the fair value of debt measured using Level 2 inputs.  Notes 3, 4, and 6 include
discussions of the fair values recorded in purchase accounting using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs.  Level 3 inputs to our
purchase accounting and impairment analyses include our estimations of fair value, net operating results of the
property, capitalization rates and discount rates.
Gains or losses on Issuances of Stock by Equity Method Investees
When one of our equity method investees issues additional shares to third parties, our percentage ownership
interest in the investee may decrease. In the event the issuance price per share is higher or lower than our average
carrying amount per share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance, when appropriate. This noncash
gain or loss is recognized in our net income in the period the change of ownership interest occurs.
Use of Estimates
We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our actual results could differ from these
estimates.
Segment and Geographic Locations
Our primary business is the ownership, development, and management of premier shopping, dining,
entertainment and mixed use real estate. We have aggregated our retail operations, including malls, Premium
Outlets, The Mills, and our international investments into one reportable segment because they have similar
economic characteristics and we provide similar products and services to similar types of, and in many cases, the
same, tenants.  As of December 31, 2022, approximately 6.9% of our consolidated long-lived assets and 3.5% of our
consolidated total revenues were derived from assets located outside the United States.  As of December 31, 2021,
approximately 7.1% of our consolidated long-lived assets and 3.0% of our consolidated total revenues were derived
from assets located outside the United States.
Deferred Costs and Other Assets
Deferred costs and other assets include the following as of December 31:

103Deferred Lease Costs
Our deferred leasing costs consist primarily of initial direct costs and, prior to the adoption of ASC 842,
capitalized salaries and related benefits, in connection with lease originations. We record amortization of deferred
leasing costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Details of these deferred costs as of
December 31 are as follows:
    2022     2021  
Deferred lease costs $312,464 $358,287
Accumulated amortization  (214,911 ) (249,132 )
Deferred lease costs, net $97,553 $109,155
Amortization of deferred leasing costs is a component of depreciation and amortization expense. The
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income include amortization of deferred
leasing costs as follows:
For the Year Ended December 31,  
    2022     2021     2020  
Amortization of deferred leasing costs $39,606 $43,028 $51,349
Intangibles
The average remaining life of in-place lease intangibles is approximately 2.9 years and is being amortized on
a straight-line basis and is included with depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income. The fair market value of above and below market leases is amortized into lease income
over the remaining lease life as a component of reported lease income. The weighted average remaining life of these
intangibles is approximately 2.5 years. The unamortized amount of below market leases is included in accounts
payable, accrued expenses, intangibles and deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets and was $15.3
million and $21.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of amortization of above and
below market leases, net, which increased lease income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,
was $1.7 million, $2.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. If a lease is terminated prior to the original lease
termination, any remaining unamortized intangible is written off to earnings.
Details of intangible assets as of December 31 are as follows:
2022     2021
In-place lease intangibles $67,935 $115,550
Accumulated amortization (60,859 )(101,443 )
In-place lease intangibles, net $ 7,076 $14,107
2022 2021
Acquired above market lease intangibles $130,556 $133,224
Accumulated amortization (119,860 )(114,053 )
Acquired above market lease intangibles, net $10,696 $19,171

Derivative Financial Instruments
We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the
fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have designated a derivative as a
hedge and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. We may
use a variety of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to selectively manage or hedge a
portion of the risks associated with our indebtedness and interest payments. Our objectives in using interest rate
derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To
accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps and caps. We require that hedging derivative
instruments be highly effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. We generally formally
designate instruments that meets these hedging criteria as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract.  We
have no credit-risk-related hedging or derivative activities.
As of December 31, 2022, we had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives related to managing our
interest rate risk:
Number of Notional
Interest Rate Derivative     Instruments    Amount
Interest Rate Swaps  1 €128.0  million
Interest Rate Caps 5 €319.0  million
As of December 31, 2021, we had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives related to managing our
interest rate risk:
Number of Notional
Interest Rate Derivative     Instruments    Amount  
Interest Rate Swaps  2 $375.0  million
The carrying value of our interest rate cap and swap agreements, at fair value, as of December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 was a net asset balance of $1.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and is included in deferred
costs and other assets.
Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations.
We manage exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest
rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt.

105We may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of an anticipated debt issuance. Upon completion of the
debt issuance, the fair value of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.
The unamortized gain on our treasury locks and terminated hedges recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income was $10.9 million and $6.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Within
the next year, we expect to reclassify to earnings approximately $1.0 million of gains related to terminated interest
rate swaps from the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
We are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset
gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposers, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging
these exposers. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for
speculative purposes.
We are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on financial instruments which are denominated
in foreign currencies, primarily in Yen and Euro.   We use currency forward contracts, cross currency swap contracts,
and nonderivative instruments such as foreign currency denominated debt to manage our exposure to changes in
foreign exchange rates on certain Yen and Euro-denominated receivables and net investments.  Currency forward
contracts involve fixing the Yen:USD or Euro:USD exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign
currency on a specified date. The currency forward contracts are typically cash settled in U.S. dollars for their fair
value at or close to their settlement date.
We had the following Euro:USD forward contracts designated as net investment hedges at December 31,
2022 and 2021 (in millions):

Asset balances in the above table are included in deferred costs and other assets. Liability balances in the
above table are included in other liabilities.
We have designated certain derivative and nonderivative instruments as net investment hedges. Accordingly,
we report the changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (loss).  For the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021, and 2020 we recorded gains (losses) of $131.7 million, $176.0 million, and ($198.7 million), respectively, in the
cumulative translation adjustment section of the other comprehensive income (loss).  Changes in the value of these
instruments are offset by changes in the underlying hedged Euro investments.

106The total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to Simon’s derivative activities, including our
share of other comprehensive income (loss) from unconsolidated entities, was $36.5 million and ($10.0) million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the
Operating Partnership’s derivative activities, including our share of the other comprehensive income (loss) from
unconsolidated entities, was $41.8 million and ($11.4) million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Noncontrolling Interests
Simon
Details of the carrying amount of our noncontrolling interests are as follows as of December 31:
    2022     2021
Limited partners’  interests in the Operating Partnership $448,076 $477,292
Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in properties, net  25,052  14,241
Total noncontrolling interests reflected in equity $473,128 $491,533
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which includes nonredeemable and redeemable
noncontrolling interests in consolidated properties, limited partners’ interests in the Operating Partnership, and
preferred distributions payable by the Operating Partnership on its outstanding preferred units) is a component of
consolidated net income. In addition, the individual components of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented
in the aggregate for both controlling and noncontrolling interests, with the portion attributable to noncontrolling
interests deducted from comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders.
The Operating Partnership
Our evaluation of the appropriateness of classifying the Operating Partnership’s common units of partnership
interest, or units, held by Simon and the Operating Partnership's limited partners within permanent equity considered
several significant factors. First, as a limited partnership, all decisions relating to the Operating Partnership’s
operations and distributions are made by Simon, acting as the Operating Partnership’s sole general partner. The
decisions of the general partner are made by Simon's Board of Directors or management. The Operating Partnership
has no other governance structure. Secondly, the sole asset of Simon is its interest in the Operating Partnership. As a
result, a share of common stock of Simon, or common stock, if owned by the Operating Partnership, is best
characterized as being similar to a treasury share and thus not an asset of the Operating Partnership.
Limited partners of the Operating Partnership have the right under the Operating Partnership’s partnership
agreement to exchange their units for shares of common stock or cash, as selected by Simon as the sole general
partner. Accordingly, we classify units held by limited partners in permanent equity because Simon may elect to issue
shares of common stock to limited partners exercising their exchange rights rather than using cash. Under the
Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to redeem units held by Simon
only when Simon has repurchased shares of common stock. We classify units held by Simon in permanent equity
because the decision to redeem those units would be made by Simon.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which includes nonredeemable and redeemable
noncontrolling interests in consolidated properties) is a component of consolidated net income.

Revenue Recognition
We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and
account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of
the leases when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is
probable of collection. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales
over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize this variable lease consideration only when each
tenant’s sales exceed the

and where indicated as in millions or billions)
108applicable sales threshold. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of lease income utilizing the straight-
line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.
We structure our leases to allow us to recover a significant portion of our property operating, real estate taxes,
repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotion expenses from our tenants. A substantial portion of our
leases, other than those for anchor stores, require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of our operating
expenses, including common area maintenance, or CAM, real estate taxes and insurance.  Such property operating
expenses typically include utility, insurance, security, janitorial, landscaping, food court and other administrative
expenses. This significantly reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from
inflation or otherwise. For substantially all of our leases in the U.S. mall portfolio, we receive a fixed payment from the
tenant for the CAM component which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease beginning with the adoption of ASC 842. When not reimbursed by the fixed CAM component, CAM expense
reimbursements are based on the tenant’s proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses and CAM capital
expenditures for the property. We accrue all variable reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all of
these expenses as variable lease consideration in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. We recognize
differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the subsequent year. These differences
were not material in any period presented. Our advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.
 Provisions for credit losses that are not probable of collection are recognized as a reduction of lease income.  
In April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of
COVID-19 on the application of lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842,
“Leases.” The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842
when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration.  We have elected to generally account for rent
abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect
to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or
determine we expect to grant, an abatement.  We have agreed to deferral or abatement arrangements with a number
of our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, uncollected rent due from certain of our tenants is
subject to ongoing litigation, the outcome of which may affect our ability to collect in full the associated outstanding
receivable balances.
In connection with rent deferrals or other accruals of unpaid rent payments, if we determine that rent payments
are probable of collection, we will continue to recognize lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term
along with associated tenant receivables. However, if we determine that such deferred rent payments or other
accrued but unpaid rent payments are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on the cash basis,
with the corresponding tenant receivable and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct write-off against
lease income in the period of the change in our collectability determination.  Additionally, our assessment of
collectability incorporates information regarding a tenant’s financial condition that is obtained from available financial
data, the expected outcome of contractual disputes and other matters, and our communications and negotiations with
the tenant.
When a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability
of receivable balances. Our ongoing assessment incorporates, among other things, the timing of a tenant’s
bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumptions by the tenant in bankruptcy proceedings of leases at the
Company’s properties on substantially similar terms.  Refer to Note 9 for further disclosure of lease income.  
Management Fees and Other Revenues
Management fees and other revenues are generally received from our unconsolidated joint venture properties
as well as third parties. Management fee revenue is earned based on a contractual percentage of joint venture
property revenue. Development fee revenue is earned on a contractual percentage of hard costs to develop a
property. Leasing fee revenue is earned on a contractual per square foot charge based on the square footage of
current year leasing activity. We recognize revenue for these services provided when earned based on the
performance criteria.

109Revenues from insurance premiums charged to unconsolidated properties are recognized on a pro-rata basis
over the terms of the policies. Insurance losses on these policies and our self-insurance for our consolidated
properties are reflected in property operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income and include estimates for losses incurred but not reported as well as losses pending
settlement. Estimates for losses are based on evaluations by third-party actuaries and management’s estimates. Total
insurance reserves for our insurance subsidiaries and other self-insurance programs as of December 31, 2022 and
2021 approximated $85.7 million and $77.2 million, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. Information related to the securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive
insurance subsidiary is included within the “Equity Instruments and Debt Securities” section above.
Income Taxes
Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT
qualification. In order to maintain this REIT status, the regulations require the entity to distribute at least 90% of REIT
taxable income to its owners and meet certain other asset and income tests as well as other requirements. We intend
to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain Simon’s REIT status and that of the REIT subsidiaries. As
REITs, these entities will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not
less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Thus, we made no provision for U.S. federal income taxes for these
entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If Simon or any of the REIT subsidiaries fail to qualify
as a REIT, and if available relief provisions do not apply, Simon or that entity will be subject to tax at regular corporate
rates for the years in which it failed to qualify. If Simon or any of the REIT subsidiaries loses its REIT status it could
not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless the
failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied.
We have also elected taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, status for some of our subsidiaries. This enables us to
provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and participate in activities that do not
qualify as “rents from real property”. For these entities, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for
temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted
tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. An increase or
decrease in the valuation allowance that results from the change in circumstances that causes a change in our
judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in income.
As a partnership, the allocated share of the Operating Partnership’s income or loss for each year is included in
the income tax returns of the partners; accordingly, no accounting for income taxes is required in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements other than as discussed above for our TRSs.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net deferred tax liabilities of $278.3 million and $259.3 million,
respectively, which primarily relate to the temporary differences between the carrying value of balance sheet assets
and liabilities and their tax bases. These differences were primarily created through the consolidation of various
European assets in 2016. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets related to our TRSs, consisting of operating
losses and other carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes as well as the timing of the deductibility of losses
or reserves from insurance subsidiaries, though these amounts are not material to the financial statements. The
deferred tax asset in included in deferred costs and other assets and the deferred tax liability is included in other
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
We are also subject to certain other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, as well as income-
based and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments, which are included in income
and other taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Cash paid for taxes $ 53,241 $ 102,454 $ 20,046
Corporate Expenses
Home and regional office costs primarily include compensation and personnel related costs, travel, building
and office costs, and other expenses for our corporate home office and regional offices.  General and administrative
expense primarily includes executive compensation, benefits and travel expenses as well as costs of being a public
company, including certain legal costs, audit fees, regulatory fees, and certain other professional fees.
Simon Property Group Acquisition Holdings, Inc.
The Company sponsored, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, a special purpose acquisition corporation, or
SPAC, named Simon Property Group Acquisition Holdings, Inc.  On February 18, 2021, the SPAC announced the
pricing of its initial public offering, which was consummated on February 23, 2021, generating gross proceeds of
$345.0 million, which have been placed in a trust account and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet in Investments held in trust – special purpose acquisition company.  The SPAC is a consolidated VIE which was
formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination.  The Company accounts for the noncontrolling interest in
the SPAC as noncontrolling redeemable interests as these instruments are redeemable at the option of the holder
and are classified as temporary equity at their redemption value in Simon’s accompanying consolidated balance
sheet in Limited partners preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests and
in the Operating Partnership’s accompanying consolidated balance sheet in Preferred units, various series, at
liquidation value, and noncontrolling redeemable interests.
In December 2022, the SPAC was liquidated and dissolved, resulting in the recognition of a $10.2 million loss
recorded in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net in the consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive income, representing our investment in the SPAC.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform,” which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the US
GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the
expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. Additional
optional expedients, exceptions, and clarifications were created in ASU 2021-01. The guidance is effective upon
issuance and generally can be applied to any contract modifications or existing and new hedging relationships
through December 31, 2024. We elected the expedients in conjunction with transitioning certain debt instruments, as
discussed in Note 7, to alternative benchmark indexes.  There was no impact on our consolidated financial
statements at adoption.
4. Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions
We acquire interests in properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We
acquire interests in individual properties or portfolios of real estate companies that meet our investment criteria and
sell properties which no longer meet our strategic criteria. Unless otherwise noted below, gains and losses on these
transactions are included in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets
and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income. We capitalize asset acquisition costs and expense costs related to business
combinations, as well as disposition related costs as they are incurred. We incurred a minimal amount of transaction
expenses during 2022, 2021, and 2020. Refer to Note 6 for disclosure of unconsolidated joint venture acquisitions
and dispositions.

111Our acquisition and disposition activity for the periods presented are as follows:
2022 Acquisitions
On June 17, 2022, we acquired an additional interest in Gloucester Premium Outlets from a joint venture
partner for $14.0 million in cash consideration, including a pro-rata share of working capital, resulting in the
consolidation of this property. The property is subject to an $85.7 million 3.29% variable interest rate mortgage loan.
We accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and substantially all of our investment has been determined
to relate to investment property.
2022 Dispositions
During 2022, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. The proceeds from this
transaction were $59.0 million, resulting in a loss of $15.6 million.
2021 Dispositions
During 2021, we recorded net gains of $176.8 million primarily related to disposition activity which included the
foreclosure of three consolidated retail properties in satisfaction of their respective $180.0 million, $120.9 million and
$100.0 million non-recourse mortgage loans, and this non-cash investing and financing activity is excluded from our
consolidated statement of cash flows.
2020 Dispositions
On October 1, 2020, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. A portion of the gross
proceeds on this transaction of $33.4 million was used to partially repay a cross-collateralized mortgage. Our share of
the $12.3 million gain is included in (loss) gain on sale or disposed of, or recovery on, assets and interests in
unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operation and
comprehensive income.
5. Per Share and Per Unit Data
We determine basic earnings per share and basic earnings per unit based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock or units, as applicable, outstanding during the period and we consider any participating
securities for purposes of applying the two-class method. We determine diluted earnings per share and diluted
earnings per unit based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock or units, as applicable,
outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average number of shares or units, as applicable, that would
have been outstanding assuming all potentially dilutive securities were converted into shares of common stock or
units, as applicable, at the earliest date possible. The following tables set forth the components of basic and diluted
earnings per share and basic and diluted earnings per unit.

6. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and International Investments
Real Estate Joint Ventures and Investments
Joint ventures are common in the real estate industry. We use joint ventures to finance properties, develop
new properties and diversify our risk in a particular property or portfolio of properties.  As discussed in Note 2, we held
joint venture interests in 82 properties as of December 31, 2022 and 84 properties as of December 31, 2021.
Certain of our joint venture properties are subject to various rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, put and
call rights, or other sale or marketing rights for partners which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements
and the industry. We and our partners in these joint ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable
lock up or similar restrictions), which may result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or
borrowings, or the use of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, to acquire the joint venture
interest from our partner.
We may provide financing to joint ventures primarily in the form of interest bearing construction loans. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had construction loans and other advances to these related parties totaling
$112.0 million and $88.4 million, respectively, which are included in deferred costs and other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
On December 19, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a 50% noncontrolling legal ownership interest in
Jamestown, a global real estate investment and asset management company, as well as separate interests in certain
real estate and working capital, for total cash consideration of $173.4 million.  Given the timing of the transaction,
there was no impact on our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022.  In addition, allocation of the
excess investment to the underlying assets and liabilities acquired at the venture level is preliminary at December 31,
2022.
During 2022, we recorded a non-cash gain of $19.9 million related to the disposition and foreclosure of two
unconsolidated properties in satisfaction of the respective $99.6 million and $83.1 million non-recourse mortgage
loans,

interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
and comprehensive income. This non-cash investing and financing activity is excluded from our consolidated

During the fourth quarter of 2021, we disposed of our interest in an unconsolidated property resulting in a gain
of $3.4 million which is included in (gain) loss on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on,
assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income. Our share of the proceeds from this transaction was $3.0 million.

the gross proceeds from this transaction was $27.1 million. The gain of $14.9 million on the sale is included in other
income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
In the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $55.2 million,
representing our equity method investment balance in three joint venture properties, which is included in (loss) gain
on sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Additionally, in the third quarter of
2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $36.1 million and
$47.2 million, respectively, related to an investment, which is included in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling
interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Taubman Realty Group
On December 29, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an 80% noncontrolling ownership interest in TRG,
which has an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Under the terms of the
transaction, we, through the Operating Partnership, acquired all of Taubman Centers, Inc., or Taubman, common
stock for $43.00 per share in cash. Total consideration for the acquisition, including the redemption of Taubman’s
$192.5 million 6.5% Series J Cumulative Preferred Shares and its $170.0 million 6.25% Series K Cumulative
Preferred Shares, and the issuance of 955,705 Operating Partnership units, was approximately $3.5 billion. Our
investment includes the 6.38% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for $362.5 million issued to us. In
connection with the finalization of the purchase price allocation, we recorded additional amortization of our excess
investment of $52.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 as a revision to the preliminary amortization previously
recorded.  Substantially all of our investment has been allocated to investment property based upon fair values
determined at the acquisition date using Level 2 and 3 inputs.

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded net gains of $1.3 million and $1.2 million,
respectively, related to the disposition of certain assets of Klépierre. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we
recorded a 4.3 million net loss related to the impairment and disposition of certain assets of Klépierre. These
transactions are included in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets
and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, Klépierre elected to step-up the tax basis of certain assets in Italy,
which triggered a one-time payment at a significantly reduced tax rate. As a result of the step-up in tax basis, a
previously established deferred tax liability was reversed resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was $118.4
million.
We have an interest in a European investee that had interests in 11 Designer Outlet properties as of
December 31, 2022, 11 Designer Outlet properties as of December 31, 2021, and ten Designer Outlet properties as
of December 31, 2020. Seven of these Designer Outlets are consolidated by us as of December 31, 2022. As of
December 31, 2022, our legal percentage ownership interests in these properties ranged from 23% to 94%. Due to
certain redemption rights held by our venture partner, which will require us to purchase their interests under certain
circumstances, the noncontrolling interest is presented (i) in the accompanying Simon consolidated balance sheets
outside of equity in limited partners’ preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable
interests in properties and (ii) in the accompanying Operating Partnership consolidated balance sheets within
preferred units, various series, at liquidation value, and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties.
On January 1, 2021 our European investee gained control of Ochtrup Designer Outlets as a result of the
expiration of certain participating rights held by a venture partner. This resulted in the consolidation of the property
and related mortgage of $47.1 million, requiring a remeasurement of our previously held equity interest, which had a
carrying value of $48.7 million, to fair value and the recognition of a non-cash gain of $3.7 million in earnings during
the first quarter of 2021, which includes amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
related to the currency translation adjustment previously recorded on our investment. The non-cash gain is included
in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in
unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income, and this non-cash investing and financing activity is excluded from our consolidated
statement of cash flows. The determination of the fair value consisted of Level 2 and 3 inputs and was predominately
allocated to investment property.
In addition, we have a 50.0% noncontrolling interest in a European property management and development
company that provides services to the Designer Outlet properties.
We also have minority interests in Value Retail PLC and affiliated entities, which own or have interests in and
operate nine luxury outlets located throughout Europe and we also have a direct minority ownership in three of those
outlets. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of these equity instruments without readily determinable
fair values was $140.8 million and is included in deferred costs and other assets.

At December 31, 2022, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 38 non-recourse mortgage
notes secured by mortgages on 41 properties and other assets, including two separate pools of cross-defaulted and
cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default
under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool
and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt
instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as
collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply
with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At December
31, 2022, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants
where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Unsecured Debt
At December 31, 2022, our unsecured debt consisted of $18.6 billion of senior unsecured notes of the
Operating Partnership, $125.0 million outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s $4.0 billion unsecured revolving
credit facility, or Credit Facility, and $802.8 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of Euro-denominated borrowings
outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility.

121The Credit Facility also included an additional single, delayed-draw $2.0 billion term loan facility, or Term
Facility, or together with the Credit Facility and the Supplemental Facility, the Credit Facilities, which the Operating
Partnership drew on December 15, 2020, and repaid in 2021.
The Credit Facility can be increased in the form of additional commitments in an aggregate not to exceed $1.0
billion, for a total aggregate size of $5.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying
certain customary conditions precedent.  Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Pounds,
Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to
95% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Credit Facility is June 30,
2024. The Credit Facility can be extended for two additional six-month periods to June 30, 2025, at our sole option,
subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans,
the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate,
(y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in Dollars,
Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily
SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of
between 0.650% and 1.400% or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to
the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one
month plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000%
and 0.400%. The Credit Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.100%
and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility.  Based upon our current credit ratings,
the interest rate on the Credit Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the
transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
The Supplemental Facility’s borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion may be increased to $4.5 billion during its term
and provides for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Pounds, Sterling, Canadian dollars and
Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to 100% of the maximum revolving
credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Supplemental Facility is January 31, 2026 and can be
extended for an additional year to January 31, 2027 at our sole option, subject to satisfying certain customary
conditions precedent.
Borrowings under the Supplemental Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark
Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted
TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated
in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating
Overnight Daily SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our

(which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term
SOFR Rate for one month plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of
between 0.000% and 0.400%. The Supplemental Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit
rating of between 0.100% and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Supplemental Facility.
 Based upon our current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is SOFR plus 72.5 basis points,
plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
On December 31, 2022 we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $6.6 billion under the Credit
Facilities. The maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Facilities during the year ended December 31,
2022 was $1.2 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $260.7 million. Letters of credit of
$10.0 million were outstanding under the Facilities as of December 31, 2022.
The Operating Partnership also has available a Commercial Paper program of $2.0 billion, or the non-U.S.
dollar equivalent thereof. The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in
U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more
subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  Notes will be sold under
customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result
of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the Operating Partnership's other unsecured senior indebtedness.
 The Commercial Paper program is supported

Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program. On December 31, 2022,
we had no outstanding balance under the Commercial Paper program.  Borrowings under the Commercial Paper
program reduce amounts otherwise available under the Credit Facilities.

8. Equity
Simon’s Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify excess common stock into one or more additional
classes and series of capital stock, to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to fix the
preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, and qualifications
and terms and conditions of redemption of such class or series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders.
The issuance of additional classes or series of capital stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change in control of us without further action of the stockholders. The ability to issue additional classes or series of
capital stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could
have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a
majority of Simon’s outstanding voting stock.
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a
vote of stockholders, other than for the election of directors. The holders of Simon’s Class B common stock have the
right to elect up to four members of Simon’s Board of Directors. All 8,000 outstanding shares of the Class B common
stock are subject to two voting trusts as to which Herbert Simon and David Simon are the trustees. Shares of Class B
common stock convert automatically into an equal number of shares of common stock upon the occurrence of certain
events and can be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the holders.
Common Stock and Unit Issuances and Repurchases
In 2022, Simon issued 2,680 shares of common stock to two limited partners of the Operating Partnership in
exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership redeemed 14,740 units from three limited partners for
$1.9 million.  In 2021, Simon issued 58,571 shares of common stock to seven limited partners of the Operating
Partnership in exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating
Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Operating Partnership redeemed 15,705 units from
seven limited partners for $2.2 million.  These transactions increased Simon’s ownership interest in the Operating
Partnership.
On December 29, 2020, the Operating Partnership issued 955,705 units in connection with the acquisition of
an 80% ownership interest in TRG, as discussed in Note 6.
On November 18, 2020, we issued 22,137,500 shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of
$72.50 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions.  The Operating Partnership issued an equal
number of units to Simon.  A portion of the $1.6 billion proceeds from the offering, net of issue costs, were used to
fund the Operating Partnership’s acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in TRG.
On May 9, 2022, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan.  Under the plan,
Simon may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period commencing on May 16,
2022 and ending

year ended December 31, 2022, Simon purchased 1,830,022 shares at an average price of $98.57 per share.  As
Simon repurchases shares under this program, the Operating Partnership repurchases an equal number of units from
Simon.
On February 11, 2019, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase plan.  Under the
plan, Simon was authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period ending
February 11, 2021.  Simon repurchased the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as
market conditions warranted.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, Simon purchased 1,245,654 shares at an
average price of $122.50 per share.  As Simon repurchased shares under this program, the Operating Partnership
repurchased an equal number of units from Simon.
Temporary Equity
Simon
Simon classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that Simon could be
required to redeem the security for cash irrespective of the probability of such a possibility. As a result, Simon
classifies one series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in
properties in temporary equity. Each of these securities is discussed further below.
Limited Partners’ Preferred Interest in the Operating Partnership and Noncontrolling Redeemable
Interests in Properties.  The redemption features of the preferred units in the Operating Partnership contain
provisions which could require the Operating Partnership to settle the redemption in cash. As a result, this series of
preferred units in the Operating Partnership remains classified outside permanent equity.
The remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties which are redeemable at the
option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside Simon’s control, are accounted for as temporary equity.
The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to the redemption amount assuming the instrument is
redeemable at the balance sheet date. Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are
recorded and presented within accumulated deficit in the consolidated statements of equity in the line issuance of unit
equivalents and other. There were no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021.  The following table summarizes the preferred units in the Operating Partnership and
the amount of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.

redeemable interests in properties $212,239 $547,740
Refer to Note 3 for discussion of the noncontrolling redeemable interest related to the SPAC.
7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.  This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly
distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually. The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the
death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than
the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value
($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of
common stock at our election. In the event of the death of a holder of the preferred units, the occurrence of certain
tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating
Partnership to redeem the preferred units at the same redemption price payable at the option of the Operating
Partnership in either cash or shares of common stock.

the Operating Partnership in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The Operating Partnership
The Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that
the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a
possibility.  As a result, the Operating Partnership classifies one series of preferred units and noncontrolling
redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.  Each of these securities is discussed further below.
Noncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties   Redeemable instruments, which typically represent
the remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties, and which are redeemable at the option
of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside our control, are accounted for as temporary equity.  The
carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to the redemption amount assuming the instrument is
redeemable at the balance sheet date.  Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are
recorded within equity and are presented in the consolidated statements of equity in the line issuance of unit
equivalents and other.  There are no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021.  The following table summarizes the preferred units and the amount of the
noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.

Refer to Note 3 for discussion of the noncontrolling redeemable interest related to the SPAC.
7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units   The 7.50% preferred units accrue cumulative quarterly
distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually.  We may redeem the preferred units upon the death of the survivor of the
original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled
to the benefits of the original holder.  The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus
accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of common stock of Simon at our
election.  In the event of the death of a holder of the 7.5% preferred units, the occurrence of certain tax triggering
events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating Partnership
to redeem the preferred units at the same redemption price payable at the Operating Partnership’s option in either
cash or fully registered shares of common stock of Simon.  These preferred units have a carrying value of $25.5
million and are included in preferred units, at liquidation value in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2022 and 2021.
Permanent Equity
Simon
Preferred Stock.  Dividends on all series of preferred stock are calculated based upon the preferred stock’s
preferred return multiplied by the preferred stock’s corresponding liquidation value. The Operating Partnership pays
preferred distributions to Simon equal to the dividends Simon pays on the preferred stock issued.
Series J 83/8% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.  Dividends accrue quarterly at an annual rate of
83/8% per share. Simon can redeem this series, in whole or in part, on or after October 15, 2027 at a redemption
price of $50.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. This preferred stock was issued at a premium of
$7.5 million. The

The Operating Partnership
Series J 83/8% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.     Distributions accrue quarterly at an annual rate
of 83/8% per unit on the Series J 83/8% preferred units, or Series J preferred units.  Simon owns all of the Series J
preferred units which have the same economic rights and preferences of an outstanding series of Simon preferred
stock.  The Operating Partnership can redeem this series, in whole or in part, when Simon can redeem the related
preferred stock, on and after October 15, 2027 at a redemption price of $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid
distributions. The Series J preferred units were issued at a premium of $7.5 million.  The unamortized premium
included in the carrying value of the preferred units at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.6 million and $1.9

Other Equity Activity
The Simon Property Group, L.P. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan.  This plan, or the 2019 Plan, provides for the
grant of equity-based awards with respect to the equity of Simon in the form of incentive and nonqualified stock
options to purchase shares, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants and performance-based awards.
 Options may be granted which are qualified as “incentive stock options” within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code and options which are not so qualified.  An aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of common stock
have been reserved under the 2019 plan.
The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee.  The Compensation and
Human Capital Committee determines which eligible individuals may participate and the type, extent and terms of the
awards to be granted to them.  In addition, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee interprets the 2019 Plan
and makes all other determinations deemed advisable for its administration.  Options granted to employees become
exercisable over the period determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee.  The exercise price of
an employee option may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.  Employee options
generally vest over a three-year period and expire ten years from the date of grant.
Directors who are not also our employees or employees of our affiliates are eligible to receive awards under
the 2019 plan. Each independent director receives an annual cash retainer of $110,000, and an annual restricted
stock award with a grant date value of $175,000. Committee chairs receive annual retainers for the Company’s Audit,
Compensation and Human Capital, and Governance and Nominating Committee of $35,000, $35,000 and $25,000,
respectively.  Directors receive fixed annual retainers for service on the Audit, Compensation and Human Capital, and
Governance and Nominating Committees, of $15,000, $15,000, and $10,000, respectively. The Lead Director
receives an annual retainer of $50,000.  These retainers are paid 50% in cash and 50% in restricted stock.
Restricted stock awards vest in full after one year.  Once vested, the delivery of the shares of restricted stock
(including reinvested dividends) is deferred under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the director retires,
dies or becomes disabled or otherwise no longer serves as a director. The directors may vote and are entitled to
receive dividends on the underlying shares; however, any dividends on the shares of restricted stock must be
reinvested in shares of common stock and held in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the shares of
restricted stock are delivered to the former director.
Stock Based Compensation
Our long-term incentive compensation awards under our stock-based compensation plans primarily take the
form of LTIP units, restricted stock units, and restricted stock.  The substantial majority of these awards are market
condition or performance-based, and are based on various market, corporate and business unit performance
measures as further described below. The expense related to these programs, net of amounts capitalized, is included
within home and regional office costs and general and administrative costs in the accompanying statements of
operations and comprehensive

to the participant maintaining employment with us through certain dates and other conditions as described in the
applicable award agreements. Awarded LTIP units not earned in accordance with the conditions set forth in the
applicable award agreements are forfeited. Earned and fully vested LTIP units are equivalent to units of the Operating
Partnership. Participants are entitled to receive distributions on the awarded LTIP units, as defined, equal to 10% of
the regular quarterly distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership. As a result, we account for these LTIP
units as participating securities under the two class method of computing earnings per share. These are granted
under The Simon Property Group, L.P. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan.
The grant date fair values of any LTIP units that are market-based awards are estimated using a Monte Carlo
model, and the resulting fixed expense is recorded regardless of whether the market condition criteria are achieved if
the participant performs the required service period. The grant date fair values of the market-based awards are being
amortized into expense over the performance period, which is the grant date through the date at which the awards, if
earned, become vested.  The expense of the performance-based award is recorded over the performance period,
which is the grant date through the date at which the awards, if earned, become vested, based on our assessment as
to whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved during the applicable performance periods.
 The grant date fair values of any restricted stock unit awards are recognized as expense over the vesting period.
2019 LTIP Program.  In 2019, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee established and granted
awards under the 2019 LTIP Program.  Awards under the 2019 LTIP Program will be considered earned if the
respective performance conditions (based upon Funds From Operations, or FFO, per share, and Objective Criteria
Goals) and market condition (based on Relative TSR performance), as defined in the applicable award agreements,
are achieved during the applicable three-year measurement period.  All of the earned LTIP units under the 2019 LTIP
Program will vest on January 1, 2023.  The 2019 LTIP Program provides that the amount earned of the performance-
based portion of the awards is dependent on Simon’s performance compared to certain criteria and in March 2022,
the Compensation and Human Capital Committee determined 72,442 performance based LTIP units under this
program were earned as noted in the table below.
2020 LTI Program.  In 2020, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee established and granted
awards under the 2020 LTI Program, which consisted of a one-time grant of 312,263 time-based restricted stock units
under the 2019 Plan at a grant date fair market value of $84.37 per share.  One-third of these awards vested on
January 1, 2022 and the remaining awards will vest ratably on January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024.  The grant date
fair value of the awards of $26.3 million is being recognized as expense over the three-year vesting period.
2021 LTI Program.  In 2021, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee established and granted
awards under  the 2021 LTI Program.  Awards under the 2021 LTI Program took the form of LTIP units and restricted
stock units.  Awards of LTIP units under this program will be considered earned if the respective performance
conditions (based on FFO and Objective Criteria Goals) and market conditions (based on Absolute TSR
performance), as defined in the applicable award agreements, are achieved during the applicable three-year
measurement period.  Any units determined to be earned LTIP units under the 2021 LTI Program will vest on January
1, 2025.  The 2021 LTI Program provides that the amount earned related to the performance-based portion of the
awards is dependent on the Compensation and Human Capital Committee’s determination that Simon’s FFO
performance and achievement of certain objective criteria goals and has a maximum potential fair value at grant date
of $18.4 million.  As part of the 2021 LTI Program, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee also established
a grant of 37,976 time-based restricted stock units under the 2019 Plan at a grant date fair market value of $112.92
per share.  These awards will vest, subject to the grantee's continued service, on March 1, 2024.  The $4.3 million
grant date fair value of these restricted stock unit awards is being recognized as expense over the three-year vesting
period.  
2022 LTI Program.  In the first quarter of 2022, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee established
and granted awards under a 2022 Long-Term Incentive Program, or 2022 LTI Program.  Awards under the 2022 LTI
Program, took the form of LTIP units and restricted stock units.  Awards of LTIP units under this program will be
considered earned if the respective performance conditions (based on FFO and Objective Criteria Goals), subject to
adjustment based upon a TSR modifier, with respect to the FFO performance condition, as defined in the applicable
award agreements, are

129achieved during the applicable three-year measurement period.  Any units determined to be earned LTIP units under
the 2022 LTI Program will vest on January 1, 2026.  The 2022 LTI Program provides that the amount earned related
to the performance-based portion of the awards is dependent on the Compensation and Human Capital Committee’s
determination that Simon’s FFO performance and achievement of certain objective criteria goals and has a maximum
potential fair value at grant date of $20.6 million.  As part of the 2022 LTI Program, on March 11, 2022 and March 18,
2022, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee also established grants of 52,673 time-based restricted
stock units under the 2019 Plan at a grant date fair market value of $130.05 and $130.84 per share.  These awards
will vest on March 11, 2025 and March 18, 2025.  The $6.9 million grant date fair value of these restricted stock unit
awards is being recognized as expense over the three-year vesting period.  
The Compensation and Human Capital Committee approved LTIP unit grants as shown in the table below. The
extent to which LTIP units were determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee to have been
earned, and the aggregate grant date fair value, are as follows:
LTIP Program     LTIP Units Earned     Grant Date Fair Value

2019 L TIP program 72,442  $9.5 million  $14.7 million
2021 L TIP program To be determined in 2024  $5.7 million  $12.2 million
2022 L TIP program To be determined in 2025  —  $13.7 million
We recorded compensation expense, net of capitalization and forfeitures, related to LTIP programs of
approximately $24.7 million, $24.8 million, and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.  The 2019 plan also provides for shares of restricted stock to
be granted to certain employees at no cost to those employees, subject to achievement of individual performance
and certain financial and return-based performance measures established by the Compensation and Human Capital
Committee related to the most recent year’s performance. Once granted, the shares of restricted stock then vest
annually over a three-year or a four-year period (as defined in the award). The cost of restricted stock grants, which is
based upon the stock’s fair market value on the grant date, is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period.
Through December 31, 2022 a total of 5,858,453 shares of restricted stock, net of forfeitures, have been awarded
under the 1998 plan, and 769,912 shares of restricted stock and RSUs have been awarded under the 2019 plan.
Information regarding restricted stock awards is summarized in the following table for each of the years
presented:

Exchange Rights
Simon
Limited partners in the Operating Partnership have the right to exchange all or any portion of their units for
shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash, as determined by Simon’s Board of Directors. The amount
of cash to be paid if the exchange right is exercised and the cash option is selected will be based on the trading price
of Simon’s common

130stock at that time. At December 31, 2022, Simon had reserved 54,305,552 shares of common stock for possible
issuance upon the exchange of units, stock options and Class B common stock.
The Operating Partnership
Limited partners have the right under the partnership agreement to exchange all or any portion of their units
for shares of Simon common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash, as determined by Simon in its sole discretion. If
Simon selects cash, Simon cannot cause the Operating Partnership to redeem the exchanged units for cash without
contributing cash to the Operating Partnership as partners’ equity sufficient to effect the redemption.  If sufficient cash
is not contributed, Simon will be deemed to have elected to exchange the units for shares of Simon common stock.
 The amount of cash to be paid if the exchange right is exercised and the cash option is selected will be based on the
trading price of Simon’s common stock at that time. The number of shares of Simon’s common stock issued pursuant
to the exercise of the exchange right will be the same as the number of units exchanged.
9. Lease Income
Fixed lease income under our operating leases includes fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM

Litigation
We are involved from time-to-time in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course
of our business, including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, environmental matters, and litigation in connection
with transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that current proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is
considered probable

Lease Commitments
As of December 31, 2022, we are subject to ground leases that cover all or a portion of 23 of our consolidated
properties with termination dates extending through 2090, including periods for which exercising an extension option
is reasonably assured. These ground leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments, or a fixed
annual rental payment plus a percentage rent component based upon the revenues or total sales of the property. In
addition, we have several regional office locations that are subject to leases with termination dates ranging from 2023
to 2025. These office leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments plus pay our share of
common area, real estate, and utility expenses. Some of our ground and office leases include escalation clauses.  All
of our lease arrangements are classified as operating leases.  We incurred ground lease expense and office lease
expense, which are included in other expense and home office and regional expense, respectively, as follows:

132Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage with third-party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific
layers of potential losses, including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss
insurance on all of our properties in the United States as well as cyber coverage. The initial portion of coverage not
provided by third-party carriers may be insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance company, or other
financial arrangements controlled by us. If required, a third-party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence of
coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier’s insurance policy with us. A similar
insurance policy written either through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by
us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks.
We currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States
on an “all risk” basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any
threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could adversely affect our property values, revenues,
consumer traffic and tenant sales.
Hurricane Impacts
During the third quarter of 2017, two of our wholly-owned properties located in Puerto Rico sustained
significant property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Maria.  Since the date of the loss, we
have received $84.0 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers related to the two properties located in
Puerto Rico, of which $48.3 million was used for property restoration and remediation and to reduce the insurance
recovery receivable.  During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $2.1 million and $5.2
million, respectively, as business interruption income, which was recorded in other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Texas experienced property damage and
business interruption as a result of Hurricane Hanna.  We wrote-off assets of approximately $9.6 million, and
recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $14.0 million of insurance proceeds from third-party
carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery
receivable.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $3.5 million gain related to property insurance
recovery of previously depreciated assets.  This amount was recorded in gain (loss) on acquisition of controlling
interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net.
During the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Louisiana experienced property damage and
business interruption as a result of Hurricane Laura.   We wrote-off assets of approximately $11.1 million and
recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $27.5 million of insurance proceeds from third-party
carriers.  The proceeds were used for property restoration and remediation and reduced the insurance recovery
receivable.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $17.5 million gain related to property
insurance recovery of previously depreciated assets.  This amount was recorded in gain (loss) on acquisition of
controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and
impairment, net.
Guarantees of Indebtedness
Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the joint venture property, which
is non-recourse to us. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture
related mortgage indebtedness of $128.0 million and $209.9 million, respectively. Mortgages guaranteed by the
Operating Partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the
outstanding obligation and which have estimated fair values in excess of the guaranteed amount.

133Concentration of Credit Risk
Our U.S. Malls, Premium Outlets, and The Mills rely upon anchor tenants to attract customers; however,
anchors do not contribute materially to our financial results as many anchors own their spaces. All material operations
are within the United States and no customer or tenant accounts for 5% or more of our consolidated revenues.
COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a
global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic had
a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world. The impact of the COVID-19
pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities, including where we own or hold interests in
properties, have at times imposed measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of
movement, group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures,
quarantines, stay-at-home, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures.  As a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic and these measures, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience
material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to changes in our assessment of the
probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated
by our properties and investments.  
11. Related Party Transactions
Transactions with Affiliates
Our management company provides office space and legal, human resource administration, property specific
financing and other support services to Melvin Simon & Associates, Inc., or MSA, a related party, for which we
received a fee of $0.6 million in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020.  In addition, pursuant to management agreements that
provide for our receipt of a management fee and reimbursement of our direct and indirect costs, we have managed
since 1993 two shopping centers owned by entities in which David Simon and Herbert Simon have ownership
interests, for which we received a fee of $3.8 million, $3.5 million, and $3.3 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020,
respectively.  
Transactions with Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
As described in Note 2, our management company provides management, insurance, and other services to
certain unconsolidated joint ventures.  Amounts received for such services were $112.1 million, $102.1 million, and
$92.7 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  During 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recorded development, royalty,
and other fee income, net of elimination, related to our unconsolidated international joint ventures of $12.1 million,
$12.4 million, and $13.1 million, respectively.  The fees related to our international investments are included in other
income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  Neither MSA, David
Simon, or Herb Simon have an ownership interest in any of our unconsolidated joint ventures, except through their
ownership interests in the Company or the Operating Partnership.
We have investments in retailers including J.C. Penney and SPARC Group, and these retailers are lessees at
certain of our operating properties.  Lease income from the date of our investments in our consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income related to these retailers was $83.8 million, $82.5 million, and $54.1 million for
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, net of elimination.

Simon
Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Simon maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to Simon’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent
limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Our management, with the participation of Simon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Simon’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, Simon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, Simon’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance
level.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Simon is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, Simon’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by Simon’s Board
of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our
transactions and disposition of assets;
● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors; and
● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
We assessed the effectiveness of Simon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In
making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment and
criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, Simon’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
The audit report of Ernst & Young LLP on their assessment of Simon's internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022 is set forth within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in Simon's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-
15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Simon's internal control over financial reporting.

reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the

Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Operating Partnership is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, Simon’s principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by Simon’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our
transactions and disposition of assets;
● Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors; and
● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
We assessed the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that
assessment and criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
The audit report of Ernst & Young LLP on their assessment of the Operating Partnership’s internal control over

There have not been any changes in the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Operating Partnership’s internal control over
financial reporting.
