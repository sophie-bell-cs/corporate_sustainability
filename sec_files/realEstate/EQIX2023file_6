ITEM 1.     Business
Overview: Powering the World’s Digital Leaders
Equinix is the world's digital infrastructure company. Digital leaders harness our trusted platform to bring together and
interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. We enable our customers to access all the right places,
partners and possibilities they need to accelerate their advantage. Platform Equinix combines a global footprint of International
Business Exchange™ ("IBX") and xScale data centers in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa
("EMEA") regions, interconnection solutions, digital offerings, unique business and digital ecosystems and expert consulting and
support. Equinix was incorporated on June 22, 1998, as a Delaware corporation and operates as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes.
Al Avery and Jay Adelson founded Equinix as a network-neutral, multi-tenant data center ("MTDC") provider, where competing
networks could connect and share data traffic to help scale the rapid growth of the early internet. The company’s name, Equinix
(composed from the words "equality", "neutrality" and "internet exchange"), reflects that vision. The founders also believed they not
only had the opportunity but also the responsibility to create a company that would be the steward of some of the most important
digital infrastructure assets in the world. Nearly two and a half decades later, we have expanded upon that vision to build Platform
Equinix, which we believe is unmatched in scale and reach.
Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to bring together and interconnect the infrastructure
they need to fast-track their digital advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, speed the launch of digital offerings, deliver
world-class experiences and multiply their value. We enable them to differentiate by distributing infrastructure and removing the
distance between clouds, users and applications in order to reduce latency and deliver a superior customer, partner and employee
experience. The Equinix global platform, and the quality of our IBX and xScale data centers, interconnection offerings and edge
solutions, have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth
cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers and connect
directly with each other. This adjacency creates a network effect that attracts new customers, continuously compounds our existing
customers' value and enables them to capture further economic and performance benefits from our offerings.

In 2022, we opened or acquired 13 new IBX data centers, opened three new xScale data centers via our joint ventures, and
entered three new markets resulting in an increase in our total number of IBX and xScale data center facilities to 248. 2022
highlights include:
•New data center openings included 13 new IBX sites in the following metros: Abidjan, Accra, Genoa, Lagos, Lima, Munich,
Manchester, Paris and Santiago.
•Three additional xScale sites opened in 2022 in Frankfurt, Dublin and Sydney, bringing our total number of xScale data
centers to 11. xScale data centers serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's
largest cloud service providers, and are engineered to meet the technical and operational requirements and price points of
core hyperscale workload deployments. xScale data centers also offer access to our comprehensive suite of
interconnection and edge offerings that tie into the hyperscale companies' existing access points at Equinix, thereby
increasing the speed of connectivity to their existing and future enterprise customers. In xScale sites, hyperscale
companies can consolidate core and access point deployments into one global provider to streamline and simplify their
growth.
•In December, we announced plans to enter the South Africa market with a $160 million IBX data center investment in
Johannesburg that augments our current footprint on the African continent. With our South Africa expansion, Equinix is
entering one of the largest and most digitally developed nations on the African continent. The new data center is expected
to open in the middle of 2024.
•In November, we announced plans to enter the Malaysia market with a $40 million IBX data center investment. Equinix's
expansion in Malaysia will offer opportunities for Malaysian businesses expanding internationally and for multinational
corporations pursuing growth and innovation in the Malaysian market. Located in Johor, the new data center is expected to
open in the first half of 2024.
•In October, we announced our plans for expansion into Indonesia, with an approximately $74 million IBX data center
investment in the heart of Jakarta. Driven by rapid business digitalization and a substantial digital-savvy population,
Indonesia has emerged as Southeast Asia's largest digital economy in value, and is expected to be a key hub of
interconnection in the region.
•We also announced in October a $45 million investment in a new facility in Bogota, Colombia, scheduled to open in the first
half of 2023. This will be our second data center in Colombia and further reinforces Equinix’s commitment to strengthening
the digital economy across Latin America.
•In September, we opened a new IBX data center in Paris, France. Part of Equinix's Saint-Denis campus, the new site
("PA10") represents the tenth data center opened by Equinix in Paris. The new $163 million facility will incorporate multiple
sustainability best practices, including heat recovery technology directly connected to Paris’s Saint-Denis urban heating
network.
•In August, we completed our acquisition of a data center in Lima, Peru, from Empresa Nacional De Telecomunicaciones
S.A. ("Entel"), a leading Chilean telecommunications provider, for a total purchase consideration of $80.3 million at the
exchange rate in effect on the date of signing.
•In June, Equinix and PGIM Real Estate, the real estate investment and financing arm of PGIM, Prudential Financial's
global asset management business, opened the first xScale data center in Sydney ("SY9x"). This milestone followed the
closing of the $575 million joint venture between the parties in March of 2022.
•Extending our presence deeper into Latin America in May, we completed the acquisition of four data centers in Chile, from
Entel, for a total purchase consideration of $638.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on the date of signing.
•In April, we entered Africa, closing on our $278.4 million acquisition of MainOne, a leading West African data center and
connectivity solutions provider, with presence in Nigeria, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. The completion of the acquisition
augmented Equinix's long-term strategy to become a leading African carrier-neutral digital infrastructure company by being
able to bring a full range of transformative technologies and connectivity to Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire.
•Our new IBX data center in Aschheim, near Munich, Germany (“MU4”), opened in February to support the growing digital
needs of local companies—particularly from the automotive, industrial, financial and healthcare sectors—providing them
with direct, secure and fast connectivity to a multitude of cloud providers, services and partners. Like other new Equinix
builds in Germany, it was designed in line with Equinix’s global sustainability strategy, featuring a green façade and partially
planted roof. Additionally, the data center is expected to be powered by 100% renewable energy—purchased through a
green power certificate from local supplier, Mainova.

•In January, we signed a joint venture agreement with GIC in Singapore to develop and operate two xScale data centers in
Seoul, Korea. The joint venture will bring our global xScale data center portfolio to more than $8 billion across 36 facilities.
Industry Trends: Large-scale global trends are driving a digital-first strategy
Digital transformation is changing where and how businesses deploy and deliver IT services to employees and is creating new
digital business models for partners and customers. The convergence of these global trends has created additional pressure for
many companies to transform. The collective influence of these trends is driving complexity and risk that must be addressed in
multiple locations for companies to effectively compete in the global digital economy. These trends include:
•The digital presence trend underpins businesses’ prioritization of transformation to engage and deliver value
electronically. To compete in the digital economy, organizations are shifting to digital solutions. Digital transformation
investment levels for 2022–2024 are expected to be $6.3 trillion and 55% of all Information and Communication Technology
("ICT") investment by the end of 2024. This forces the need for a digital infrastructure optimized for proximity to, and
interconnection with, networks and clouds. This in turn enables digital development with elastic scale. IT becomes a
revenue-generating function and the basis of competitive advantage for developing connected product bundles.
•The digital participation trend is digitizing trade and accessing digital marketplaces (digital B2B commerce) where goods
and services are exchanged in the digital economy. Leveraging ecosystem and network effects optimizes collaboration and
compounds business value. By 2023, it is expected that one in two companies will generate more than 40% of their
revenues from digital products and services. The Global Interconnection Index 2023 ("GXI 2023"), a market study
published by Equinix, shows that this forces the need to interconnect digital infrastructure with research communities,
supply chains and marketplaces, enabling composable business models. IT becomes a business technology broker across
an ecosystem of digital solutions and facilitates collaboration with network effects.
•The digital proximity trend means digitizing the front office for localized and personalized delivery—to customers,
employees and operations where business happens, as well as digitizing the physical world for the physical infrastructure
and operations intelligence needed to optimize commercial and environmental impact. By 2028, the global infrastructure
edge footprint is expected to be 40 gigawatts, with 63% supporting healthcare, manufacturing, energy, retail and
transportation. IT becomes fully integrated with operational technology ("OT") to balance transparency, efficiency and
sustainability with greater mobility, security and control.
•The sustainability trend means that companies are now being held accountable by investors, employees and customers
to demonstrate progress on Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") commitments. Sustainability is believed to be
important by 90% of executives, but only 60% of organizations have sustainability strategies. These strategies include
setting and measuring sustainability goals through science-based targets and key initiatives. IT must subscribe to the most
efficient commodity solutions from sustainability leaders.
These trends are accelerating the need for companies like Equinix that can provide a secure, agile global business platform
that leverages digital interconnection—or private data exchange—to deliver real-time interactions around the world.
As part of their digital transformation, businesses in most industries are shifting their centralized IT infrastructures to the edge
to bring digital solutions closer to users for better performance, which has become a significant driver of digital business value. To
realize the full potential of the edge, IT organizations require greater interconnection bandwidth. Interconnection bandwidth is
defined as the total capacity provisioned to privately and directly exchange traffic, with a diverse set of partners and providers, at
distributed IT exchange points inside carrier-neutral colocation data centers. Private interconnection capacity between businesses,
as reported in GXI 2023, is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 40% by 2025, reaching 27,762 terabits per
second of data exchanged annually.

data center and digital solutions and products to over 10,000 enterprise and service provider customers worldwide.
The following are the leading revenue-generating product and other offerings that collectively make up Platform Equinix:    
Data Center Offerings
Our global, state-of-the-art data centers meet strict standards of security, reliability, certification and sustainability. Offerings in
these data centers are typically billed based on the space and power a customer consumes, are delivered under a fixed duration
contract and generate monthly recurring revenue ("MRR"). Our footprint consists of 248 data centers:
•International Business ExchangeData Centers are our vendor-neutral colocation data centers worldwide, providing our
customers with secure, reliable and robust environments (including space and power) that are necessary to aggregate and
distribute information and connect digital and business

ecosystems globally. IBX data centers provide access to vital ecosystems where enterprises, network, cloud and SaaS
providers, and business partners, can directly and securely interconnect to each other.
•xScale Data Centers are designed to serve the unique core workload deployment needs of a targeted group of hyperscale
companies, which include the world's largest cloud service providers. With xScale data centers, hyperscale customers add
to their core hyperscale data center deployments and existing customer access points at Equinix, allowing streamlined
expansion with a single global vendor.
Equinix colocation offerings include a suite of comprehensive solutions that provide all the components required by a customer
to house its IT infrastructure (or equipment). These offerings are designed to speed and streamline digital transformation and data
center deployments for our customers.
•Private Cages are typically designed and built to order for a single customer, with space assigned based on purchased
power allocations and planned cabinet quantity. A cage typically includes steel mesh walls with a locking door,
interconnection provision such as a demarcation rack with patch panels, and cabling systems such as a ladder rack and
fiber raceway. Available security accessories include dedicated cameras, biometric hand scanners and more.
•Secure Cabinets are steel-framed cabinets sized to industry standards, with lockable, fully ventilated doors, and are
typically configured to order. Secure Cabinets provide a private, secure, smaller-footprint alternative to a Private Cage.
Each cabinet includes an integrated, interconnection-ready demarcation panel and power circuitry sufficient to support
planned utilization requirements. Secure cabinets are typically housed in a shared, secured cage within the data center
facility.
•Secure Cabinet Express are ready-for-service Secure Cabinets which are pre-configured to an Equinix recommended,
and most common, cabinet configuration. This configuration fits the majority of modern IT deployment requirements,
providing a simplified and globally consistent colocation module for cabinet-sized deployments.
Equinix offers a variety of enabling solutions which support a customer's need to implement, operate and maintain their
colocated deployments. These solutions include both on-consumption and subscription services which may generate monthly
recurring revenue ("MRR") as well as non-recurring revenue ("NRR").
•IBX SmartView is a fully integrated monitoring software which provides customers visibility into the operating data
relevant to their specific Equinix footprint as if they were in-house. The software provides online access to real-time
environmental and operating data through the Equinix Customer Portal or via either REST (APIs that provide customers
the ability to retrieve information about their assets from every IBX location) or streaming API integrations. With real-time
alerts and configurable reporting, IBX SmartView allows customers to maintain their IBX operations and plan for future
growth.

Digital Offerings
Our edge solutions help businesses rapidly deploy as a service networking, security and hardware across our global data
center footprint as an alternative to buying, owning and managing the physical infrastructure. Our edge solutions are typically billed
based on the number of instances and the capacity used by a customer and generate MRR.
•Network Edge allows customers to modernize networks within minutes, by deploying network functions virtualization
("NFV") from multiple vendors across Equinix metros. Companies can select, deploy and connect virtual network solutions
at the edge quickly, with no additional hardware requirements.
•Equinix Metal allows enterprises, SaaS companies and digital service providers to provision interconnected bare metal
resources in minutes instead of months, while reducing the capital expenditures and operational requirements of owning
hardware. They can also reduce cloud costs while retaining the flexibility and operational expenditures of cloud solutions
via on-demand, reserved or spot market capacity in Equinix’s global data centers using the Equinix Metal portal or
DevOps-friendly APIs and integrations. DevOps, a combination of "development" and "operations", aligns collaboration
between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) skills and experiences to build, test and deploy APIs and
other functionalities quickly.
•Equinix Precision Time provides secure Precision Time Protocol ("PTP") and Network Time Protocol ("NTP") Time as a
Service for distributed enterprise applications on Platform Equinix. The solution uses redundant and strategically located
equipment and the high-performance network backbone of Equinix Fabric to deliver secure, reliable and precise time
synchronization. Customers gain access to the product portal, allowing them to provision, manage and monitor their
service.
Competition
While a large number of enterprises and service providers, such as hyperscale cloud service providers, own their own data
centers, we believe the industry is shifting away from single-tenant solutions to outsourcing some or all of their IT housing and
interconnection requirements to third party facilities, such as those operated by us. This shift is being accelerated by the increasing
adoption of hybrid multicloud architectures.
Historically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers who bundled their products and services
with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral MTDC
providers, public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems integrators. It
is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC
market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and
network offerings, outsourced IT infrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has®

accelerated and is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business and
the use of multiple cloud service providers.
Equinix is differentiated in this market by being able to offer customers a global platform that reaches over 30 countries and
contains the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, including access to a leading share of cloud on-
ramps, and an increasingly diverse ecosystem of networks and cloud and IT service providers. This ecosystem creates a “network
effect” which improves performance and lowers cost for our customers, enabling them to become digital leaders, and is a
significant source of competitive advantage for Equinix. Additionally, our digital solutions portfolio enables customers to bring
together physical and programmable technologies like compute, storage, network and applications, to build a foundation for their
company's digital operations.
Customers
Our customers include telecommunications carriers, mobile and other network services providers, cloud and IT services
providers, digital media and content providers, financial services companies, and global enterprise ecosystems in various

Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 12,097 employees worldwide with 5,493 based in the Americas, 3,936 based in EMEA and
2,668 based in Asia-Pacific. Of those employees, 5,130 employees were in engineering and operations, 1,985 employees were in
sales and marketing and 4,982 employees were in management, finance and administration. As of December 31, 2022,
approximately 73% of our workforce identified as men and approximately 26% identified as women. Women's representation in
leadership (defined as VP and above) remained constant at 31% year-over-year.
At Equinix, we strive to build a culture where every employee, every day, can say “I’m Safe, I Belong and I Matter” and where
our workforce, at all levels, reflects and represents the communities in which we operate. Our objective is to continue to make our
culture a critical competitive advantage, engaging every leader and every employee in the process. To ensure we are upholding our
core corporate values and making progress towards our aspirational goals, we monitor employee satisfaction through a quarterly
pulse survey, which is one of our listening mechanisms. In 2022, employee satisfaction scores remained steady between 81-82 out
of 100 each quarter, resulting in a score for Equinix three points higher than the benchmark score of the top 20th percentile of other
companies. Managers use their quarterly pulse survey results to engage in dialogue with their teams about what is top of mind for
our employees and how we can do better.
Attracting, developing and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success and we offer industry competitive
compensation and benefits, along with development opportunities to help every employee achieve their full potential. We continue
to benefit from talent sourcing programs such as our global new-to-career programs as well as pathways programs for veterans
and women returning to the workforce. In 2022, we continued to enhance our portfolio of development programs for our employees
and gained full adoption of a system-enabled approach to goal setting, development planning and performance assessment to
support objectivity and accountability in our talent management process. We offer development tools and opportunities to our
employees such as online learning, manager training, professional coaching and 360-degree assessments for eligible employees
as well as our leadership program specifically designed for high potential employees at the Director level and above.
We believe in equitable pay and equitable opportunity at every level of the organization. Equinix remains committed to
attracting more women and other historically underrepresented groups to join the company, and to ensuring we have fair and
consistent practices in place to recognize, reward and promote all employees, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or
other protected classes. Equinix operates a rigorous governance framework to manage pay and other compensation elements to
ensure that all reward decisions are made fairly and without discrimination or bias. All roles are mapped and graded to one
consistent global organizational framework. Each grade has a specific pay range created by benchmarking against the external
market in the country in which the role is located. This global framework is also used to determine target levels for annual bonuses
and long-term incentives. We strive to annually update our market data globally where information is available.
We are integrating diversity, inclusion and belonging ("DIB") into every aspect of how we run our business. In 2020, we
embarked on a multi-year DIB strategy with governance through a DIB Council chaired by our CEO and CHRO, and in partnership
with our Sustainability Program Office, that oversees our progress on environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters. Our
DIB strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, global workforce; building leadership capability and
accountability; and empowering our people to bring DIB to life. We have built multiple pathways to reach new talent from diverse
communities. In 2022, we continued to forge partnerships and invest in tools and systems to grow and support our inclusive hiring
practices and made updates to our recruitment marketing to reach a wider candidate pool more effectively. In 2022, our Talent
Acquisition Team partnered with members of two of our Equinix Employee-led Connection Networks ("EECNs"), BlackConnect and
GenteConnect, to build new avenues for recruiting Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx talent to Equinix in the U.S. We also
embedded diversity and inclusive behavior competencies in our leadership profiles and added coaching tools as well as manager
training on leading inclusive teams to our development program.
Our EECNs are integral to our DIB strategy and play an important role in creating belonging and advocating for the needs and
goals of communities with common identities, cultures or backgrounds. Each of our nine EECNs represents an identity/community
that has faced historical discrimination or shares unique challenges. We recognize that creating the best workplace and culture we
can requires a global effort with localized awareness and approaches. In 2020, we launched WeAreEquinix employee teams
empowered to create, localize and promote purpose, inclusion and belonging for their locations across the world. Through live and
virtual events, campaigns, and collaboration with the business, these volunteer leaders bring local opportunities to engage in the
following

areas: Wellbeing, Green and Sustainability, Community Impact, Fun and Creativity, DIB, and Employee Networks. We currently
have WeAreEquinix teams in 35 locations.
Equinix representatives have joined the G100 Talent Consortium Task Force on Racial Inequity in Business to consider core
inequity issues, including anti-racism, bias, and hiring and promotability practices, in order to develop tangible best practices that
companies can use as guide rails to increase representation and career mobility for black, indigenous and people of color
("BIPOC") employees. In 2022, we hosted a Days of Understanding event as part of an initiative of CEO ACT!ON, a pledge Equinix
has taken along with hundreds of other companies to embrace difference in our organizations, educate our people and build more
inclusive cultures inside and outside of our workplaces. As part of this partnership, three Equinix employees completed ACT!ON’s
inaugural two-year fellowship program focused on identifying, developing, and promoting scalable and sustainable policies and
corporate best practices that address systemic racism and social injustice to improve societal wellbeing, and two new fellows
joined. Equinix also completed its first year as a member of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, a coalition of global organizations
working together to bring inclusivity and full equity to the workplace. This past year, Equinix worked with the Alliance to address
inclusive language, leadership representation, and STEM readiness in under-resourced communities. Finally, in 2022 Equinix
continued and expanded its programs with McKinsey to provide leadership development not only to our Black/African American
leaders, but also to include individuals who identify as part of the Asian and Latinx communities through the Leadership Academy.
Our Community Impact program promotes connection and belonging, and enables employees to give back, with the support of
Equinix, to the communities in which we work and live. In 2022, employees volunteered 22,759 service hours and over $2 million
was donated through employee giving, corporate matching funds and grants. Additionally, in 2022, The Equinix Foundation was
launched with a focus on the advancement of digital inclusion—from access to technology and connectivity to the skills needed to
thrive in today's digitally driven world.
We believe our commitment to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and ethical behavior differentiates our business as
much as our technology. We promote these high standards through a number of policies including the Equinix Code of Business
Conduct. All employees are required to complete trainings on ethics and the company’s anti-bribery and corruption policies. In
addition, we maintain a confidential ethics helpline where employees are encouraged to speak up if they have any questions or
concerns that our code is being violated. We have a zero-tolerance, non-retaliation policy that protects our employees when they
speak up.
We have continued a number of precautionary measures in line with our business continuity and pandemic plans to minimize
the risk of operational impacts and to protect the health and safety of employees, customers, partners and our communities. In
2022, we took a careful approach to the opening of our offices based on guidance from health experts and other leaders from
around the world. As we look forward to the future of work, and more importantly amplifying Equinix’s vibrant culture, we are
providing flexible, hybrid work opportunities in many roles, enhanced collaboration technologies for everyone, and activity-based
workspaces at home or onsite. We recognize that the new normal will require changing behaviors. As such, we are providing
learning opportunities and best practices to ensure our meetings, events and work sessions are inclusive and equitable for virtual
and in-person participation. Employee well-being has been central to these efforts, driven globally through offerings such as health
programs, ergonomic support, technology reimbursements, and wellness days.
We believe that all of these programs and initiatives support our human capital goals, align with our company culture, and
increase employee satisfaction.

Sustainability
At Equinix, our Future First sustainability strategy rallies our people and partners to envision a better future and then do what it
takes to make it happen. As the world’s digital infrastructure leader, we believe we have the responsibility to harness the power of
technology to create a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future. The ESG initiatives comprising our Future First strategy
focus on the issues that have the greatest impact on our stakeholders and our business. We continue to work to progress on our
sustainability goals and look to build a business and world that reflects our purpose to bring the world together on our platform to
create the innovations that will enrich our work, life and planet. We document our ESG progress in our Annual Report as well as in
the annual Corporate Sustainability Report.
In 2021, we committed to becoming climate neutral across our global operations by 2030 and set a validated near-term
science-based target (“SBT”) for emissions reduction across our global operations and supply chain. Our climate commitments are
a critical step to ensure that we continue to advance investments and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions
and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement.
As a part of our Future First sustainability strategy, we published an Environmental Sustainability and Global Climate Change
Policy in 2021 to detail our approach and practices related to the environment, climate change, resource efficiency and reporting. In
alignment with our strategy and policy, we are also evaluating our material climate change risks and opportunities based on the
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). In 2022, we undertook a qualitative and
quantitative climate-related scenario analysis across eight climate scenarios in line with TCFD recommendations. This included
scenario analysis modeling for the highest priority physical risks. We are continuing our work to embed climate change risk
management into our business where relevant.
Environmental Performance
Equinix was the first data center company to commit to a long-term goal of 100% renewable energy across our global portfolio.
We use local renewable energy sources where possible, seek new or recently built renewable sources and advocate for favorable
renewable energy policies. In the U.S., we purchase nearly 2.5 million megawatt-hours ("MWh") of green power annually from a
portfolio of renewable energy projects, including 225 MW of wind power under long-term virtual power purchase agreements
("VPPAs") located in Texas and Oklahoma. We have also recently executed 3 VPPAs in Europe which will bring 129 MW of new
wind capacity to Finland when the projects are operational in 2024, 2025 and 2026. In 2021, 95% of our global electricity
consumption, and 100% of U.S. electricity consumption, was covered by renewable energy sources.
We are committed to transparently measuring and reporting our global carbon footprint across direct (Scope 1), indirect energy
(Scope 2) and indirect value chain (Scope 3) emissions. Since 2019, we have achieved a 12% reduction in GHG emissions on an
absolute basis (Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (mtCO2e)), even as the company
doubled its footprint in both energy consumption and number of sites. In 2022, CDP, a global non-governmental organization
dedicated to helping investors and companies measure and manage their climate risks, recognized our commitments, actions and
progress on climate change.
14
Table of Contents
We received an 'A' CDP leadership score for climate action and annual disclosures within the CDP Climate Change survey.
We are leveraging technology and innovation to encourage commercialization of solutions that will enable the “Data Center of
the Future”. To support our ongoing sustainability initiatives and commitment to innovation, we issued green bonds approximating
$3.7 billion from 2020 to 2021, with an additional $1.2 billion in 2022. Our Green Finance Framework aligns our sustainability
commitments with our long-term financing needs and highlights our pipeline of green projects and data center innovations. As of
December 31, 2022, we have allocated $3.7 billion in net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, ongoing and new
projects in categories of green buildings, renewable energy and energy efficiency.
We are committed to advancing environmental progress across other areas of our operations. While energy usage, specifically
electricity, is our largest environmental impact, to address the growing importance of water within our operations, we launched a
Sustainable Water Management Program in 2021. This program drove the implementation of tools to aid in the tracking of water
usage at our data centers, helping create a 2021 baseline of our Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to inform future actions. We
consider the consumption of water in the design and operation of our facilities and are developing a coordinated global approach to
water measurement and management. Through our efforts to establish the European Climate-Neutral Data Centre Operator Pact in
2021, Equinix and the EU data center industry have also committed to advancing initiatives beyond renewable energy and energy
efficiency, including water efficiency, waste reduction, and circular economy principles.
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") Disclosures
SASB published the Sustainability Accounting Standard ("Standard") for the Real Estate Industry in October 2018. We have
aligned our SASB disclosures with the Real Estate Standard to enhance corporate disclosure around ESG performance. In our
comprehensive disclosures in our annual Corporate Sustainability Report, we also document our progress against metrics as
outlined in other frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI"), UN Sustainable Development Goals ("SDGs") and
TCFD. The following tables detail our energy metrics, aligned with the SASB Real Estate Standard. We intend to expand our
reporting around the Real Estate Standard in the coming years.
The following metrics represent our colocation facilities performance in the calendar years specified. Energy, renewable energy
and GHG emissions are independently assured to ISO 14064-3:2006 Standards for the quantification and reporting of GHG
emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3). Calendar year data for 2022 will become available in Q2 2023 and will be published in our annual
Corporate Sustainability Report.

Energy Management: Green Building Ratings
Our environmental efforts aim to deliver meaningful and measurable progress against sustainability goals that positively impact
our customers, partners, investors and employees. Our data centers are designed with high operational standards and energy
efficiency in mind. Our data centers are planned holistically to incorporate the needs of our communities and we aim to minimize
the use of all resources in our operations. We evaluate cost-efficient opportunities to enhance energy efficiency and buy renewable
energy for existing or acquired sites.
We are working to protect our planet's resources by pioneering green data center innovations and building and operating
energy-efficient data centers around the world. Our Energy Efficiency Center of Excellence is driving a global approach to cooling
our existing data centers more efficiently. The program engages customers to manage their implementations more sustainably at
our facilities, leading to overall improved site efficiencies.
We certify our data centers to numerous green buildings and energy management certifications and schemes. These include
USGBC LEED green buildings certifications, ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Standard, ISO 50001:2011 Energy
Management Standard, BCA Green Mark, U.S. EPA Energy Star for Data Centers and others. In 2021, Equinix became a U.S.
Green Building Council (USGBC) Gold member, aligning with the developer of the LEED rating system and furthering our
commitment to green buildings. To increase the scalability of certification within our portfolio, we developed a global LEED
Scorecard that will help us ensure every new build is prioritizing the design and community guidelines developed by USGBC.
Data centers receiving green building ratings in 2021 and 2022 covered 1.6 million gross sq. ft. While we have additional

ITEM 1A.     Risk Factors
In addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in
evaluating our business:
Risk Factors
Risks Related to the Macro Environment
Inflation in the global economy, increased interest rates and adverse global economic conditions, like the ones we are
currently experiencing, could negatively affect our business and financial condition.
Inflation in the United States, Europe and other geographies has risen to levels not experienced in recent decades and we are
seeing its impact on various aspects of our business. We are also experiencing an increase in our costs to procure power and
supply chain issues globally. Rising prices for materials related to our IBX data center construction and our data center offerings,
energy and gas prices, as well as rising wages and benefits costs negatively impact our business by increasing our operating
costs. The levels of inflation we are currently experiencing may cause a decrease in sales as some customers may need to take
cost cutting measures or scale back their operations. This could result in churn in our customer base, reductions in revenues from
our offerings, adverse effects to our DSO, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price
competition, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Customers and vendors filing for bankruptcy could also lead to costly and
time-intensive actions with adverse effects, including greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection. The uncertain
economic environment could also have an impact on our foreign exchange forward contracts if our counterparties' credit
deteriorates or if they are otherwise unable to perform their obligations. Finally, volatility in the financial markets like we are
currently experiencing could affect our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we desire, or need, to do so which could
have an impact on our flexibility to pursue additional expansion opportunities and maintain our desired level of revenue growth in
the future.
Our efforts to mitigate the risks associated with these adverse conditions may not be successful and our business and growth
could be adversely affected.
We are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been the result
of many global macro-economic factors including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. These
macro-economic and other factors could negatively affect our business and financial condition.
The war in Ukraine has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets,
an increase in cyber security incidents as well as supply chain disruptions.
Additionally, various of Russia’s actions have led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the U.S., the European
Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries, as well as other public and private actors and companies, against Russia and
certain other geographic areas, including agreement to remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide
Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system and restrictions on imports of Russian oil, liquified natural gas and coal.
We do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine and historically we have had a limited number of Russian and Ukrainian
customers, which we continue to screen against applicable sanctions lists per our standard processes. Although we continue to
devote resources to this screening effort, including the use of software solutions, the sanctions screening process remains partially
manual, and the sanctions lists continue to evolve and vary by country. We continue to address necessary changes in global
sanctions laws and modify our processes as necessary in light of these evolving laws. A material failure to comply with global
sanctions laws could have a negative effect on our reputation, business and financial condition.
In addition to compliance with applicable sanctions laws, we are currently limiting the ability of Russian customers to place
orders for our offerings unless, after reviewing these orders, we believe they are aligned with our stated objectives in support of
Ukraine. We have suspended all activities and purchasing with and through Russian partners and suppliers and have committed to
not make any direct or indirect investment in Russia absent an end to this conflict. In addition, for our customers located in Ukraine,
we are currently providing offerings free of charge and may continue to do so in the future.

Table of Contents
The associated disruptions in the oil and gas markets have caused, and could continue to cause, significant increases in
energy prices, which could have a material effect on our business. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been
proposed and/or threatened. Some of our IBX data centers in EMEA partially rely on energy produced in-part from fossil fuels
originating from Russia, which Russia has reduced. If Russia further reduces or turns off energy supplies to Europe, our EMEA
operations could be adversely affected. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could further affect the global economy
and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain
additional debt or equity financing on attractive terms in the future.
Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainty as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any of the foregoing may also magnify the impact of
other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our business could be harmed by increased costs to procure power, prolonged power outages, shortages or capacity
constraints as well as restrictions on access to power.
Any power outages, shortages, capacity constraints or significant increases in the cost of power may have an adverse effect on
our business and our results of operations.
In each of our markets, we rely on third parties, third party infrastructure, governments, and global suppliers to provide a
sufficient amount of power to maintain our IBX data centers and meet the needs of our current and future customers. Any limitation
on the delivered energy supply could limit our ability to operate our IBX data centers. These limitations could have a negative
impact on a given IBX data center(s) or limit our ability to grow our business which could negatively affect our financial performance
and results of operations.
Our IBX data centers are affected by problems accessing electricity sources, such as planned or unplanned power outages
and limitations on transmission or distribution of power. Unplanned power outages, including, but not limited to those relating to
large storms, earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, cyberattacks, war, and any failures of electrical power grids more generally, and
planned power outages by public utilities, such as those related to Pacific Gas and Electric Company's planned outages in
California to minimize fire risks, could harm our customers and our business. Employees working from home could be subjected to
planned power outages at home which could be difficult to track and could affect the day to day operations of our non-IBX data
center employees. Our international operations are sometimes located outside of developed, reliable electricity markets, where we
are exposed to some insecurity in supply associated with technical and regulatory problems, as well as transmission constraints.
Some of our IBX data centers are located in leased buildings where, depending upon the lease requirements and number of
tenants involved, we may or may not control some or all of the infrastructure including generators and fuel tanks. As a result, in the
event of a power outage, we could be dependent upon the landlord, as well as the utility company, to restore the power. We
attempt to limit our exposure to system downtime by using backup generators, which are in turn supported by onsite fuel storage
and through contracts with fuel suppliers, but these measures may not always prevent downtime or solve for long-term or large-
scale outages. Any outage or supply disruption could adversely affect our business, customer experience and revenues.
We are currently experiencing inflation and volatility pressures in the energy market globally. In particular, current dislocation in
the Singapore power market has resulted in Equinix having to buy power at extremely elevated spot and future rates and this
ongoing price volatility impacted elements of our 2022 financial results and long-term models. Various macroeconomic factors are
contributing to the instability and global power shortage including the Russia and Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic, severe
weather events, governmental regulations, government relations and inflation. The price for power in many of the countries in which
we operate has seen significant increases in recent months, and it is unclear when the markets will stabilize. While we have aimed
to minimize our risk exposure related to power procurement in Singapore and globally via hedging, conservation, and other
efficiencies, we expect the cost for power to continue to be volatile and unpredictable and subject to inflationary pressures. We
believe we have made appropriate estimates for these costs in our forecasting but the current unpredictable energy market could
materially affect our financial forecasting, results of operations and financial condition.
Each new facility requires access to significant quantities of electricity. Limitations on generation, transmission and distribution
may limit our ability to obtain sufficient power capacity for potential expansion sites in new or
19
Table of Contents
existing markets. We may experience significant delays and substantial increased costs demanded by the utilities to provide the
level of electrical service required by our current IBX data center designs.
Risks Related to our Operations
We experienced an information technology security breach in the past and may be vulnerable to future security
breaches, which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation
and financial condition.
Despite our efforts to protect against cyber-attacks, we are not fully insulated from these types of security breaches, and such
an attack could adversely impact our competitiveness and results of operations. For example, in September 2020, we discovered
ransomware on certain of our internal systems. While the incident was resolved and did not cause a material disruption to our
systems nor result in any material costs to us, we expect we will continue to face risks associated with unauthorized access to our
computer systems, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or
other malicious activities. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure, fraud or malice on the part of employees,
vendors or third parties. As techniques used to breach security change frequently and are generally not recognized until launched
against a target, we may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred, or implement security measures in a
timely manner or, if and when implemented, we may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be
circumvented. Our adaptation to a hybrid working model that includes both work from home and in an office could continue to
expose us to new security risks. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our networks or the security of our
infrastructure could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers or our
employees, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers' operations. As we provide assurances to our
customers that we provide a high level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation.
We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by
breaches in security. Any breaches that may occur in the future could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties,
loss of existing or potential customers, damage relating to loss of proprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in
our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. We maintain
insurance coverage for cyber risks, but such coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.
We offer professional solutions to our customers where we consult on data center solutions and assist with implementations.
We also offer managed services in certain of our foreign jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where we manage the data center
infrastructure for our customers. The access to our clients' networks and data, which is gained from these solutions, creates some
risk that our clients' networks or data could be improperly accessed. We may also design our clients' cloud storage systems in such
a way that exposes our clients to increased risk of data breach. If we were held responsible for any such breach, it could result in a
significant loss to us, including damage to our client relationships, harm to our brand and reputation, and legal liability.
Any failure of our physical infrastructure or negative impact on our ability to meet our obligations to our customers, or
damage to customer infrastructure within our IBX data centers, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could
reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial condition.
Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable solutions. We must safeguard our customers' infrastructure
and equipment located in our IBX data centers and ensure our IBX data centers and non-IBX offices remain operational at all
times. We own certain of our IBX data centers, but others are leased by us, and we rely on the landlord for basic maintenance of
our leased IBX data centers and office buildings. If such landlord has not maintained a leased property sufficiently, we may be
forced into an early exit from the center which could be disruptive to our business. Furthermore, we continue to acquire IBX data
centers not built by us. If we discover that these buildings and their infrastructure assets are not in the condition we expected when
they were acquired, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs to repair or upgrade the IBX data centers. Newly
acquired data centers also may not have the same power infrastructure and design in place as our own IBX data centers. These
legacy designs could require upgrades in order to meet our standards and our customers’ expectations. Until the legacy systems
are brought up to our standards, customers in these legacy IBX data centers could be exposed to higher risks of unexpected power
outages. We have experienced power outages because of these legacy design issues in the past and we could experience these in
the future.

Problems at one or more of our IBX data centers or corporate offices, whether or not within our control, could result in service
interruptions or significant infrastructure or equipment damage. These could result from numerous factors, including but not limited
to:
•human error;
•equipment failure;
•physical, electronic and cyber security breaches;
•fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters;
•extreme temperatures;
•water damage;
•fiber cuts;
•power loss;
•terrorist acts;
•sabotage and vandalism;
•global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic;
•inability of our operations employees to access our IBX data centers for any reason; and
•failure of business partners who provide our resale products.
We have service level commitment obligations to certain customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment
damage in our IBX data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential
claims related to such failures. Because our IBX data centers are critical to many of our customers' businesses, service
interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or
consequential damages to our customers. We cannot guarantee that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our
liability in the event that one of our customers brings a lawsuit against us as a result of a problem at one of our IBX data centers
and we may decide to reach settlements with affected customers irrespective of any such contractual limitations. Any such
settlement may result in a reduction of revenue under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In addition, any loss
of service, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our
customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to
generate revenues and our results of operations.
Furthermore, we are dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and other website operators in
the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions and elsewhere, some of which have experienced significant system failures and
electrical outages in the past. Our customers may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our
systems and offerings. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.
Our IBX data center employees are critical to our ability to maintain our business operations and reach our service level
commitments. Although we have redundancies built into our workforce, if our IBX employees are unable to access our IBX data
centers for any reason, we could experience operational issues at the affected site. Pandemics, weather and climate related crises
or any other social, political, or economic disruption in the U.S. or abroad could prevent sufficient staffing at our IBX data centers
and have a material adverse impact on our operations.
We are currently making significant investments in our back-office information technology systems and processes.
Difficulties from or disruptions to these efforts may interrupt our normal operations and adversely affect our business
and results of operations.
We have been investing heavily in our back-office information technology systems and processes for a number of years and
expect such investment to continue for the foreseeable future in support of our pursuit of global, scalable solutions across all
geographies and functions that we operate in. These continuing investments include: 1) ongoing improvements to the customer
experience from initial quote to customer billing and our revenue recognition process; 2) integration of recently-acquired operations
onto our various information technology systems; and 3) implementation of new tools and technologies to either further streamline
and automate processes, or to support our compliance with evolving U.S. GAAP. Our finance team is also working on a multi-year
project to move the
21
Table of Contents
backbone of our finance systems to the cloud. As a result of our continued work on these projects, we may experience difficulties
with our systems, management distraction and significant business disruptions. For example, difficulties with our systems may
interrupt our ability to accept and deliver customer orders and may adversely impact our overall financial operations, including our
accounts payable, accounts receivables, general ledger, fixed assets, revenue recognition, close processes, internal financial
controls and our ability to otherwise run and track our business. We may need to expend significant attention, time and resources
to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions. All of these changes to our financial systems also
create an increased risk of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting until such systems are stabilized. Such
significant investments in our back-office systems may take longer to complete and cost more than originally planned. In addition,
we may not realize the full benefits we hoped to achieve and there is a risk of an impairment charge if we decide that portions of
these projects will not ultimately benefit us or are de-scoped. Finally, the collective impact of these changes to our business has
placed significant demands on impacted employees across multiple functions, increasing the risk of errors and control deficiencies
in our financial statements, distraction from the effective operation of our business and difficulty in attracting and retaining
employees. Any such difficulties or disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
The level of insurance coverage that we purchase may prove to be inadequate.
We carry liability, property, business interruption and other insurance policies to cover insurable risks to our company. We
select the types of insurance, the limits and the deductibles based on our specific risk profile, the cost of the insurance coverage
versus its perceived benefit and general industry standards. Our insurance policies contain industry standard exclusions for events
such as war and nuclear reaction. We purchase earthquake insurance for certain of our IBX data centers, but for our IBX data
centers in high-risk zones, including those in California and Japan, we have elected to self-insure. The earthquake and flood
insurance that we do purchase would be subject to high deductibles. Any of the limits of insurance that we purchase, including
those for flood or cyber risks, could prove to be inadequate, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to implement our evolving organizational structure or if we are unable to recruit or retain key executives
and qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.
In connection with the evolving needs of our customers and our business, we continue to review our organizational architecture
and have made, and will continue to make, changes as appropriate, including recently announced leadership and organizational
changes to our digital and data center solutions teams. We must also continue to identify, hire, train and retain key personnel who
maintain relationships with our customers and who can provide the technical, strategic and marketing skills required for our
company's growth. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields, made more acute in the current tight labor market, and
we compete with other companies for the limited pool of talent.
The failure to recruit and retain necessary key executives and personnel could cause disruption, harm our business and
hamper our ability to grow our company.
The failure to obtain favorable terms when we renew our IBX data center leases, or the failure to renew such leases, could
harm our business and results of operations.
While we own certain of our IBX data centers, others are leased under long-term arrangements. These leased IBX data centers
have all been subject to significant development by us in order to convert them from, in most cases, vacant buildings or
warehouses into IBX data centers. Most of our IBX data center leases have renewal options available to us. However, many of
these renewal options provide for the rent to be set at then-prevailing market rates. To the extent that then-prevailing market rates
or negotiated rates are higher than present rates, these higher costs may adversely impact our business and results of operations,
or we may decide against renewing the lease. There may also be changes in shared operating costs in connection with our leases,
which are commonly referred to as common area maintenance expenses. In the event that an IBX data center lease does not have
a renewal option, or we fail to exercise a renewal option in a timely fashion and lose our right to renew the lease, we may not be
successful in negotiating a renewal of the lease with the landlord. A failure to renew a lease or termination by a landlord of any
lease could force us to exit a building prematurely, which could disrupt our business, harm our customer relationships, impact and
harm our joint venture relationships, expose us to liability

under our customer contracts or joint venture agreements, cause us to take impairment charges and affect our results of operations
negatively.
We depend on a number of third parties to provide internet connectivity to our IBX data centers; if connectivity is
interrupted or terminated, our results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.
The presence of diverse telecommunications carriers' fiber networks in our IBX data centers is critical to our ability to retain and
attract new customers. We are not a telecommunications carrier, and as such, we rely on third parties to provide our customers
with carrier services. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results.
We rely primarily on revenue opportunities from the telecommunications carriers' customers to encourage them to invest the capital
and operating resources required to connect from their data centers to our IBX data centers. Carriers will likely evaluate the
revenue opportunity of an IBX data center based on the assumption that the environment will be highly competitive. We cannot
provide assurance that each and every carrier will elect to offer its services within our IBX data centers or that once a carrier has
decided to provide internet connectivity to our IBX data centers that it will continue to do so for any period of time.
Our new IBX data centers require construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network. The construction
required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our IBX data centers is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including
regulatory processes and the availability of construction resources. Any hardware or fiber failures on this network may result in
significant loss of connectivity to our new IBX data center expansions. This could affect our ability to attract new customers to these
IBX data centers or retain existing customers.
To date, the network neutrality of our IBX data centers and the variety of networks available to our customers has often been a
competitive advantage for us. In certain of our acquired IBX data centers in the Asia-Pacific region, the limited number of carriers
available reduces that advantage. As a result, we may need to adapt our key revenue-generating offerings and pricing to be
competitive in those markets.
If the establishment of highly diverse internet connectivity to our IBX data centers does not occur, is materially delayed or is
discontinued, or is subject to failure, our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.
The use of high power density equipment may limit our ability to fully utilize our older IBX data centers.
Server technologies continue to evolve and in some instances these changes can result in customers increasing their use of
high power density equipment in our IBX data centers which can increase the demand for power on a per cabinet basis. Because
many of our IBX data centers were built a number of years ago, the current demand for power may exceed the designed electrical
capacity in these IBX data centers. As power, not space, is a limiting factor in many of our IBX data centers, our ability to fully utilize
those IBX data centers may be impacted. The ability to increase the power capacity of an IBX data center, should we decide to, is
dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the local utility's ability to provide additional power; the length of time
required to provide such power; and/or whether it is feasible to upgrade the electrical infrastructure of an IBX data center to deliver
additional power to customers. Although we are currently designing and building to a higher power specification than that of many
of our older IBX data centers, there is a risk that demand will continue to increase and our IBX data centers could become
underutilized sooner than expected.
Our offerings have a long sales cycle that may harm our revenue and results of operations.
A customer's decision to purchase our offerings typically involves a significant commitment of resources. In addition, some
customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our IBX data centers until they are confident that the IBX data center has
adequate carrier connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Furthermore, we may devote significant time and resources
to pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenues.
Delays due to the length of our sales cycle may materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations, which
could harm our ability to meet our forecasts and cause volatility in our stock price.

We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.
The global multi-tenant data center market is highly fragmented. It is estimated that we are one of more than 2,200 companies
that provide these offerings around the world. We compete with these firms which vary in terms of their data center offerings and
the geographies in which they operate. We must continue to evolve our product strategy and be able to differentiate our IBX data
centers and product offerings from those of our competitors.
Some of our competitors may adopt aggressive pricing policies, especially if they are not highly leveraged or have lower return
thresholds than we do. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate
revenues. Some of these competitors may also provide our target customers with additional benefits, including bundled
communication services or cloud services, and may do so in a manner that is more attractive to our potential customers than
obtaining space in our IBX data centers. Similarly, with growing acceptance of cloud-based technologies, we are at risk of losing
customers that may decide to fully leverage cloud infrastructure offerings instead of managing their own. Competitors could also
operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share. Regional competitors may also consolidate to
become a global competitor. Consolidation of our customers and/or our competitors may present a risk to our business model and
have a negative impact on our revenues.
Failure to compete successfully may materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and provide new offerings or enhancements to existing offerings that
meet customer requirements and differentiate us from our competitors, our results of operations could suffer.
As our customers evolve their IT strategies, we must remain flexible and evolve along with new technologies and industry and
market shifts. Ineffective planning and execution in our cloud and product development strategies may cause difficulty in sustaining
our competitive advantages.
The process of developing and acquiring new offerings and enhancing existing offerings is complex. If we fail to anticipate
customers’ evolving needs and expectations or do not adapt to technological and IT trends, our results of operations could suffer. In
order to adapt effectively, we sometimes must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain certain intellectual property
and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for the new
offerings. Additionally, any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or launch of a new offering could result in customer
dissatisfaction or attrition. If we cannot continue adapting our products, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly
than us, our business could be harmed.
We have invested in joint ventures in order to develop capacity to serve the large footprint needs of a targeted set of
hyperscale customers by leveraging existing capacity and dedicated hyperscale builds. We have announced our intention to seek
additional joint ventures for certain of our hyperscale builds. There can be no assurances that our joint ventures will be successful
or that we find appropriate partners, or that we will be able to successfully meet the needs of these customers.
In 2020, we acquired Packet Host, Inc. ("Packet"), a bare metal automation company to facilitate a new hardware product
offering for us. We expect to continue to consider other new product offerings for our customers. Hardware solutions are a relatively
new market area for us which can bring challenges and could harm our business if not executed in the time or manner that we
expect. Hardware solutions can also require additional capital and may have lower margins than our data center offerings, thus
adversely impacting our results. While we believe this product offering and others we may implement in the future will be desirable
to our customers and will complement our other offerings on Platform Equinix, we cannot guarantee the success of this product or
any other new product offering.
Failure to successfully execute on our product strategy could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations.
We have government customers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions
and penalties.
24
Table of Contents
We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments and foreign governments. Some of
these customers may terminate all or part of their contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure for
governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Some of our federal government
contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these
contracts. Similarly, some of our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations.
Government contracts often have unique terms and conditions, such as most favored customer obligations, and are generally
subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or
debarment from future government business.
Because we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, including key magnet customers,
failure to attract, grow and retain this base of customers could harm our business and results of operations.
Our ability to maximize revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety
of companies, including enterprises, cloud, digital content and financial companies, and network service providers. We consider
certain of these customers to be key magnets in that they draw in other customers. The more balanced the customer base within
each IBX data center, the better we will be able to generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall
revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our IBX data centers will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of
multiple carriers, the mix of our offerings, the overall mix of customers, the presence of key customers attracting business through
vertical market ecosystems, the IBX data center's operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market our offerings.
However, some of our customers may face competitive pressures and may ultimately not be successful or may be consolidated
through merger or acquisition. If these customers do not continue to use our IBX data centers it may be disruptive to our business.
If customers combine businesses, they may require less colocation space, which could lead to churn in our customer base. Finally,
any uncertain global economic climate, including the one we are currently experiencing, could harm our ability to attract and retain
customers if customers slow spending, or delay decision-making on our offerings, or if customers begin to have difficulty paying us
or seek bankruptcy protection and we experience increased churn in our customer base. Any of these factors may hinder the
development, growth and retention of a balanced customer base and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.
Risks Related to our Financial Results
Our results of operations may fluctuate.
We have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. The fluctuations in our results of
operations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile. We may experience significant fluctuations in our
results of operations in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, many of which are listed in the Risk Factors section.
Additional factors could include, but are not limited to:
•the timing and magnitude of depreciation and interest expense or other expenses related to the acquisition, purchase or
construction of additional IBX data centers or the upgrade of existing IBX data centers;
•demand for space, power and solutions at our IBX data centers;
•changes in general economic conditions, such as those stemming from pandemics or other economic downturns, or
specific market conditions in the telecommunications and internet industries, any of which could have a material impact on
us or on our customer base;
•additions and changes in product offerings and our ability to ramp up and integrate new products within the time period we
have forecasted;
•restructuring charges or reversals of restructuring charges, which may be necessary due to revised sublease assumptions,
changes in strategy or otherwise;
•the financial condition and credit risk of our customers;
25
Table of Contents
•the provision of customer discounts and credits;
•the mix of current and proposed products and offerings and the gross margins associated with our products and offerings;
•increasing repair and maintenance expenses in connection with aging IBX data centers;
•lack of available capacity in our existing IBX data centers to generate new revenue or delays in opening new or acquired
IBX data centers that delay our ability to generate new revenue in markets which have otherwise reached capacity;
•changes in employee stock-based compensation;
•changes in our tax planning strategies or failure to realize anticipated benefits from such strategies;
•changes in income tax benefit or expense; and
•changes in or new GAAP as periodically released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB").
Any of the foregoing factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters, this
growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. It is possible that we may not be able to generate net
income on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term,
particularly with respect to lease and personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization and interest expenses. Therefore, our
results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. As such, comparisons to prior reporting periods should
not be relied upon as indications of our future performance. In addition, our results of operations in one or more future quarters may
fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
We may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, or impairment charges to our property, plant and
equipment, which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or more frequently
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment, such as changing market conditions or any changes
in key assumptions. If the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable, we are required to record a non-cash
impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value
of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made.
We also periodically monitor the remaining net book values of our property, plant and equipment, including at the individual IBX
data center level. Although each individual IBX data center is currently performing in accordance with our expectations, the
possibility that one or more IBX data centers could begin to under-perform relative to our expectations is possible and may also
result in non-cash impairment charges.
These charges could be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.
We have incurred substantial losses in the past and may incur additional losses in the future.
As of December 31, 2022, our retained earnings were $3.0 billion. We are currently investing heavily in our future growth
through the build out of multiple additional IBX data centers, expansions of IBX data centers and acquisitions of complementary
businesses. As a result, we will incur higher depreciation and other operating expenses, as well as transaction costs and interest
expense, that may negatively impact our ability to sustain profitability in future periods unless and until these new IBX data centers
generate enough revenue to exceed their operating costs and cover the additional overhead needed to scale our business for this
anticipated growth. The current global financial uncertainty may also impact our ability to sustain profitability if we cannot generate
sufficient revenue to offset the increased costs of our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data centers currently under
construction. In addition, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of any acquired companies, as well as the additional
interest expense associated with debt financing, we have undertaken to fund our growth initiatives,
26
Table of Contents
may also negatively impact our ability to sustain profitability. Finally, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in
which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
Risks Related to Our Expansion Plans
Our construction of new IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions could involve significant risks to our business.
In order to sustain our growth in certain of our existing and new markets, we may have to expand an existing data center, lease
a new facility or acquire suitable land, with or without structures, to build new IBX data centers from the ground up. Expansions or
new builds are currently underway, or being contemplated, in many of our markets. These construction projects expose us to many
risks which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The current global supply chain and
inflation issues have exacerbated many of these construction risks and created additional risks for our business. Some of the risks
associated with construction projects include:
•construction delays;
•lack of availability and delays for data center equipment, including items such as generators and switchgear;
•unexpected budget changes;
•increased prices for and delays in obtaining building supplies, raw materials and data center equipment;
•labor availability, labor disputes and work stoppages with contractors, subcontractors and other third parties, including
interruptions in work due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•unanticipated environmental issues and geological problems;
•delays related to permitting and approvals to open from public agencies and utility companies;
•unexpected lack of power access;
•power and power grid constraints;
•delays in site readiness leading to our failure to meet commitments made to customers planning to expand into a new
build; and
•unanticipated customer requirements that would necessitate alternative data center design, making our sites less desirable
or leading to increased costs in order to make necessary modifications or retrofits.
We are currently experiencing rising construction costs which reflect the increase in cost of labor and raw materials, supply
chain and logistic challenges, and high demand in our sector. While we have invested in creating a reserve of materials to mitigate
supply chain issues and inflation, it may not be sufficient and ongoing delays, difficulty finding replacement products and continued
high inflation could affect our business and growth and could have a material effect on our business. Additional or unexpected
disruptions to our supply chain or inflationary pressures could significantly affect the cost of our planned expansion projects and
interfere with our ability to meet commitments to customers who have contracted for space in new IBX data centers under
construction.
Construction projects are dependent on permitting from public agencies and utility companies. Any delay in permitting could
affect our growth. We are currently experiencing permitting delays in most metros due to reduced production from labor availability
and from other COVID-19 pandemic related permitting restrictions or stoppages. While we don't currently anticipate any material
long-term negative impact to our business because of these construction delays, these types of delays and stoppages related to
permitting from public agencies and utility companies could worsen and have an adverse effect on our bookings, revenue or
growth.
Additionally, all construction related projects require us to carefully select and rely on the experience of one or more designers,
general contractors, and associated subcontractors during the design and construction process. Should a designer, general
contractor, significant subcontractor or key supplier experience financial problems or other problems during the design or
construction process, we could experience significant delays, increased costs to complete the project and/or other negative
impacts to our expected returns.
Site selection is also a critical factor in our expansion plans. There may not be suitable properties available in our markets with
the necessary combination of high-power capacity and fiber connectivity, or selection may be
27
Table of Contents
limited. We expect that we will continue to experience limited availability of power and grid constraints in many markets as well as
shortages of associated equipment because of the current high demands and finite nature of these resources. These shortages
could result in site selection challenges, construction delays or increased costs. Thus, while we may prefer to locate new IBX data
centers adjacent to our existing locations, it may not always be possible. In the event we decide to build new IBX data centers
separate from our existing IBX data centers, we may provide metro connect solutions to connect these two IBX data centers.
Should these solutions not provide the necessary reliability to sustain connection, or if they do not meet the needs of our
customers, this could result in lower interconnection revenue and lower margins and could have a negative impact on customer
retention over time.
Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial or strategic goals that were contemplated at the
time of any transaction.
Over the last several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions, including most recently that of five data centers in Peru
and Chile from Entel in 2022, MainOne in West Africa in 2022, and GPX Global System's, Inc.'s India operations in 2021. We
expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, which may include (i) acquisitions of businesses, products, solutions or
technologies that we believe to be complementary, (ii) acquisitions of new IBX data centers or real estate for development of new
IBX data centers; (iii) acquisitions through investments in local data center operators; or (iv) acquisitions in new markets with higher
risk profiles. We may pay for future acquisitions by using our existing cash resources (which may limit other potential uses of our
cash), incurring additional debt (which may increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements) and/or issuing
shares (which may dilute our existing stockholders and have a negative effect on our earnings per share). Acquisitions expose us
to potential risks, including:
•the possible disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention by acquisition, transition and
integration activities, particularly when multiple acquisitions and integrations are occurring at the same time or when we are
entering an emerging market with a higher risk profile;
•our potential inability to successfully pursue or realize some or all of the anticipated revenue opportunities associated with
an acquisition or investment;
•the possibility that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, or businesses in which we invest, or
achieve anticipated operating efficiencies or cost savings;
•the possibility that announced acquisitions may not be completed, due to failure to satisfy the conditions to closing as a
result of:
•an injunction, law or order that makes unlawful the consummation of the acquisition;
•inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties of, or the non-compliance with covenants by, either
party;
•the nonreceipt of closing documents; or
•for other reasons;
•the possibility that there could be a delay in the completion of an acquisition, which could, among other things, result in
additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other adverse effects resulting from such uncertainty;
•the possibility that our projections about the success of an acquisition could be inaccurate and any such inaccuracies could
have a material adverse effect on our financial projections;
•the dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of our issuing stock as consideration in a transaction or selling stock in
order to fund the transaction;
•the possibility of customer dissatisfaction if we are unable to achieve levels of quality and stability on par with past
practices;
•the possibility that we will be unable to retain relationships with key customers, landlords and/or suppliers of the acquired
businesses, some of which may terminate their contracts with the acquired business as a result of the acquisition or which
may attempt to negotiate changes in their current or future business relationships with us;
•the possibility that we could lose key employees from the acquired businesses;
•the possibility that we may be unable to integrate certain IT systems that do not meet Equinix's standard requirements with
respect to security, privacy or any other standard;
•the potential deterioration in our ability to access credit markets due to increased leverage;
•the possibility that our customers may not accept either the existing equipment infrastructure or the "look-and-feel" of a new
or different IBX data center;

Table of Contents
•the possibility that additional capital expenditures may be required or that transaction expenses associated with
acquisitions may be higher than anticipated;
•the possibility that required financing to fund an acquisition may not be available on acceptable terms or at all;
•the possibility that we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under antitrust and
competition laws on a timely basis or at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing an
acquisition, limit our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of an acquisition or have other adverse
effects on our current business and operations;
•the possible loss or reduction in value of acquired businesses;
•the possibility that future acquisitions may present new complexities in deal structure, related complex accounting and
coordination with new partners, particularly in light of our desire to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT;
•the possibility that we may not be able to prepare and issue our financial statements and other public filings in a timely and
accurate manner, and/or maintain an effective control environment, due to the strain on the finance organization when
multiple acquisitions and integrations are occurring at the same time;
•the possibility that future acquisitions may trigger property tax reassessments resulting in a substantial increase to our
property taxes beyond that which we anticipated;
•the possibility that future acquisitions may be in geographies and regulatory environments to which we are unaccustomed
and we may become subject to complex requirements and risks with which we have limited experience;
•the possibility that future acquisitions may appear less attractive due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates;
•the possibility that carriers may find it cost-prohibitive or impractical to bring fiber and networks into a new IBX data center;
•the possibility of litigation or other claims in connection with, or as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from
terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;
•the possibility that asset divestments may be required in order to obtain regulatory clearance for a transaction;
•the possibility of pre-existing undisclosed liabilities, including, but not limited to, lease or landlord related liability, tax liability,
environmental liability or asbestos liability, for which insurance coverage may be insufficient or unavailable, or other issues
not discovered in the diligence process;
•the possibility that we receive limited or incorrect information about the acquired business in the diligence process; and
•the possibility that we do not have full visibility into customer agreements and customer termination rights during the
diligence process which could expose us to additional liabilities after completing the acquisition.
The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows. If an acquisition does not proceed or is materially delayed for any reason, the price of our common stock
may be adversely impacted, and we will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.
We cannot assure that the price of any future acquisitions of IBX data centers will be similar to prior IBX data center
acquisitions. In fact, we expect costs required to build or render new IBX data centers operational to increase in the future. If our
revenue does not keep pace with these potential acquisition and expansion costs, we may not be able to maintain our current or
expected margins as we absorb these additional expenses. There is no assurance we would successfully overcome these risks, or
any other problems encountered with these acquisitions.
The anticipated benefits of our joint ventures may not be fully realized, or take longer to realize than expected.
We have entered into joint ventures to develop and operate xScale™ data centers (together, the “Joint Ventures”). Equinix
owns a 20% interest and our JV partners own an 80% interest in each joint venture, and Equinix operates all facilities.
Certain sites that are intended to be utilized in Joint Ventures require investment for development. The success of these Joint
Ventures will depend, in part, on the successful development of the data center sites, and we may not realize all of the anticipated
benefits. Such development may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected and could result in increased costs,
decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of
29
Table of Contents
management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, if it is determined these sites are no longer desirable for the Joint Ventures, we would need to adapt such sites for
other purposes.
We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our Joint Ventures. The success of these Joint Ventures will depend, in
part, on the successful partnership between Equinix and our JV partners. Such a partnership is subject to risks as outlined below in
our risk factor related to Joint Ventures, and more generally, to the same types of business risks as would impact our IBX data
center business. A failure to successfully partner, or a failure to realize our expectations for the Joint Ventures, including any
contemplated exit strategy from a Joint Venture, could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
These Joint Ventures could also be negatively impacted by inflation, supply chain issues, an inability to obtain financing on
favorable terms or at all, an inability to fill the xScale sites with customers as planned, and development and construction delays,
including those we are currently experiencing in many markets globally.
Joint venture investments could expose us to risks and liabilities in connection with the formation of the new joint
ventures, the operation of such joint ventures without sole decision-making authority, and our reliance on joint venture
partners who may have economic and business interests that are inconsistent with our business interests.
In addition to our current and proposed Joint Ventures, we may co-invest with other third parties through partnerships, joint
ventures or other entities in the future. These joint ventures could result in our acquisition of non-controlling interests in, or shared
responsibility for, managing the affairs of a property or portfolio of properties, partnership, joint venture or other entity. We may be
subject to additional risks, including:
•we may not have the right to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties, partnership, joint venture or
other entity;
•if our partners become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, we may choose to or be
required to contribute such capital;
•our partners may have economic, tax or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests
or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives;
•our joint venture partners may take actions that are not within our control, which could require us to dispose of the joint
venture asset, transfer it to a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") in order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT,
or purchase the partner's interests or assets at an above-market price;
•our joint venture partners may take actions unrelated to our business agreement but which reflect poorly on us because of
our joint venture;
•disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent
our management from focusing their time and effort on our day-to-day business;
•we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or guarantee all or a portion of the joint
venture's liabilities, which may require us to pay an amount greater than its investment in the joint venture; and
•a joint venture partner's decision to exit the joint venture may not be at an opportune time for us or in our business
interests.
Each of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses, and our financial and
results of operations may be adversely affected.
If we cannot effectively manage our international operations, and successfully implement our international expansion
plans, or comply with evolving laws and regulations, our revenues may not increase, and our business and results of
operations would be harmed.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately 61%, 61% and 59%, respectively, of
our revenues outside the U.S. We currently operate outside of the U.S. in Canada, Mexico, South America, the Asia-Pacific region
and, the EMEA region.
30
Table of Contents
In addition, we are currently undergoing expansions or evaluating expansion opportunities outside of the U.S. Undertaking and
managing expansions in foreign jurisdictions may present unanticipated challenges to us.
Our international operations are generally subject to a number of additional risks, including:
•the costs of customizing IBX data centers for foreign countries;
•protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition;
•greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection;
•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including negotiating with foreign labor unions or workers' councils;
•difficulties in managing across cultures and in foreign languages;
•political and economic instability;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•difficulties in repatriating funds from certain countries;
•our ability to obtain, transfer or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to our business;
•unexpected changes in regulatory, tax and political environments such as the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the
European Union ("Brexit"), the Hong Kong national security law, and the current trade war between the U.S. and China;
•our ability to secure and maintain the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure;
•compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws;
•compliance with economic and trade sanctions enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of
Treasury and other enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions around the world including those related to the Russian and
Ukrainian war;
•compliance with changing laws, policies and requirements related to sustainability;
•compliance with evolving governmental regulation with which we have little experience; and
•compliance with evolving and varied regulations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Geo-political events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, the Hong Kong national security law, the trade war between the
U.S. and China and the war between Russia and Ukraine, may increase the likelihood of the listed risks to occur and could have a
negative effect on our business domestically or internationally. With respect to Brexit, it is possible that the level of economic
activity in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and
legal complexities in these regions which could have an adverse impact on our business and employees in EMEA and could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with international and U.S. laws and
regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and
regulations include the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and other data privacy laws and requirements, labor relations
laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, economic and trade sanctions, U.S.
laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials. With
respect to the current trade war between the U.S. and China, we have several customers in China named in restrictive executive
orders by the previous U.S. administration that are currently covered by a freeze issued by the current U.S. administration or
currently enjoined from enforcement subject to pending litigation. If Equinix is required to cease business with these companies, or
additional companies in the future, our revenues could be adversely affected. Violations of any of these domestic or international
laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the
conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to provide our offerings in one or more
countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our
international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and results of operations. Our success
depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and address these risks and manage these difficulties.
31
Table of Contents
We continue to invest in our expansion efforts but may not have sufficient customer demand in the future to realize
expected returns on these investments.
We are considering the acquisition or lease of additional properties and the construction of new IBX data centers beyond those
expansion projects already announced. We will be required to commit substantial operational and financial resources to these IBX
data centers, generally 12 to 18 months in advance of securing customer contracts, and we may not have sufficient customer
demand in those markets to support these IBX data centers once they are built. In addition, unanticipated technological changes
could affect customer requirements for data centers, and we may not have built such requirements into our new IBX data centers.
Either of these contingencies, if they were to occur, could make it difficult for us to realize expected or reasonable returns on these
investments.
Risks Related to Our Capital Needs and Capital Strategy
Our substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flows and limit our flexibility to raise additional capital.
We have a significant amount of debt and may need to incur additional debt to support our growth. Additional debt may also be
incurred to fund future acquisitions, any future special distributions, regular distributions or the other cash outlays associated with
maintaining our qualification for taxation as a REIT. As of December 31, 2022, our total indebtedness (gross of debt issuance cost,
debt discount, and debt premium) was approximately $15.2 billion, our stockholders' equity was $11.5 billion and our cash and
cash equivalents totaled $1.9 billion. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $3.9 billion of additional liquidity
available to us from our $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. In addition to our substantial debt, we lease many of our IBX data
centers and certain equipment under lease agreements, some of which are accounted for as operating leases. As of December 31,
2022, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $1.4 billion, which represents our obligation to make lease payments under those
lease arrangements.
Our substantial amount of debt and related covenants, and our off-balance sheet commitments, could have important
consequences. For example, they could:
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our
debt and in respect of other off-balance sheet arrangements, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital
expenditures, working capital, execution of our expansion strategy and other general corporate requirements;
•increase the likelihood of negative outlook from our credit rating agencies, or of a downgrade to our current rating;
•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our various debt instruments;
•increase our cost of borrowing and even limit our ability to access additional debt to fund future growth;
•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and adverse changes in governmental
regulations;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, which may place us at a competitive
disadvantage compared with our competitors;
•limit our operating flexibility through covenants with which we must comply;
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, which would also limit our
ability to further expand our business; and
•make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to
the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to
refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore,
if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher
32
Table of Contents
interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. These risks
could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Sales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our
common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay
debt. In November 2022, we established a successor "at the market" equity offering program (the "2022 ATM Program") in the
amount of $1.5 billion under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock to or through sales
agents up to established limits. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.4 billion available for sale under the 2022 ATM Program. We
expect to refresh our ATM program periodically, which could lead to additional dilution for our stockholders in the future. We may
also seek authorization to sell additional shares of common stock through other means which could lead to additional dilution for
our stockholders. Please see Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for sales of
our common stock under our ATM programs.
If we are not able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or obtain external financing, our ability to fund incremental
expansion plans may be limited.
Our capital expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, obligations to service our debt and the cash outlays
associated with our REIT distribution requirements, are, and will continue to be, a substantial burden on our cash flow and may
decrease our cash balances. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be
available on satisfactory terms. Our inability to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from
operations may require us to prioritize projects or curtail capital expenditures which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.
Our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract.
Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty's liquidity, which could make them unable to
perform under the terms of their derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract.
Risks Related to Environmental Laws and Climate Change Impacts
Environmental regulations may impose upon us new or unexpected costs.
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the United
States and at our non-U.S. locations, including those relating to the generation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous
substances and wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations also impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for
investigation and cleanup costs on current and former owners and operators of real property and persons who have disposed of or
released hazardous substances into the environment. Our operations involve the use of hazardous substances and materials such
as petroleum fuel for emergency generators, as well as batteries, cleaning solutions and other materials. At some of our locations,
hazardous substances or regulated materials are known to be present in soil or groundwater, and there may be additional unknown
hazardous substances or regulated materials present at sites we own, operate or lease. At some of our locations, there are land
use restrictions in place relating to earlier environmental cleanups that do not materially limit our use of the sites. To the extent any
hazardous substances or any other substance or material must be cleaned up or removed from our property, we may be
responsible under applicable laws, permits or leases for the removal or cleanup of such substances or materials, the cost of which
could be substantial.
33
Table of Contents
We purchase significant amounts of electricity from generating facilities and utility companies that are subject to environmental
laws, regulations and permit requirements. These environmental requirements are subject to material change, which could result in
increases in our electricity suppliers' compliance costs that may be passed through to us. Regulations promulgated by the U.S.
EPA or state agencies, or by regulators in other countries, could limit air emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, restrict
discharges of cooling water, and otherwise impose new operational restraints on power plants that could increase costs of
electricity. Regulatory programs intended to promote increased generation of electricity from renewable sources may also increase
our costs of procuring electricity. In addition, we are directly subject to environmental, health and safety laws regulating air
emissions, storm water management and other issues arising in our business. For example, our emergency generators are subject
to state and federal regulations governing air pollutants, which could limit the operation of those generators or require the
installation of new pollution control technologies. While environmental regulations do not normally impose material costs upon our
operations, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or regulations, among other factors, can
lead to additional capital requirements, limitations upon our operations and unexpected increased costs.
Regulation of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions could increase our costs of doing business, for example by increasing the
cost of electricity by reducing amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels, by requiring the use of more expensive generating
methods, by requiring capture, management or reduction of GHG emissions, or by imposing taxes or fees upon electricity or GHG
emissions. In recent years, there has been interest in the U.S. and in countries where we operate abroad in regulating GHG
emissions and otherwise addressing risks related to climate change. For example, in the U.S., new regulations and legislation have
been proposed or enacted during the Biden Administration that limit or otherwise seeks to discourage carbon dioxide emissions
and the use of fossil fuels. Such regulations and legislation have included or may in the future include measures ranging from direct
regulation of GHG emissions to "carbon taxes," and tax incentives to promote the development and use of renewable energy and
otherwise lower GHG emissions. Other countries in which we operate may also impose requirements and restrictions on GHG
emissions.
In the U.S., state regulations also have the potential to increase our costs of obtaining electricity. Certain U.S. states in which
we operate have issued or are considering and may enact environmental regulations that could materially affect our facilities and
electricity costs. For example, California has limited GHG emissions from new and existing conventional power plants by imposing
regulatory caps and by auctioning the rights to emission allowances. Multiple other states have issued regulations (or are
considering regulations) to implement carbon cap and trade programs, carbon pricing programs and other mechanisms designed to
limit GHG emissions.
To date, regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions have not had a material adverse effect on our electricity costs, but
potential new regulatory requirements and the market-driven nature of some of the programs could have a material adverse effect
on electricity costs in the future. U.S. and global environmental regulations are expected to continue to change and evolve and may
impose upon us new or unexpected costs. Concern about climate change and sustainability in various jurisdictions may result in
more stringent laws and regulatory requirements regarding emissions of carbon dioxide or other GHGs. Restrictions on carbon
dioxide or other GHG emissions could result in significant increases in operating or capital costs, including higher energy costs
generally, and increased costs from carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards that are
imposed upon our electricity suppliers. These higher energy costs, and the cost of complying across our global platform or of failing
to comply with these and any other climate change regulations, may have an adverse effect on our business and our results of
operations. The course of future legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad remains difficult to predict and the potential
increased costs associated with national or supra-national GHG regulation and other government policies cannot be estimated at
this time.
Our business may be adversely affected by physical risks related to climate change and responses to it.
Severe weather events, such as droughts, fires, flooding, heat waves, hurricanes, typhoons and winter storms, pose a threat to
our IBX data centers and our customers' IT infrastructure through physical damage to facilities or equipment, power supply
disruption, and long-term effects on the cost of electricity. The frequency and intensity of severe weather events are reportedly
increasing as part of broader climate changes. Changes in global weather patterns may also pose long-term risks of physical
impacts to our business.
We maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that would be implemented in the event of severe weather events
that interrupt our business or affect our customers' IT infrastructure housed in our IBX data centers. While these plans are designed
to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt our
34
Table of Contents
business, we cannot be certain that our plans will work as intended, to mitigate the impacts of such disasters or events. Failure to
prevent impact to customers from such events could adversely affect our business.
We may fail to achieve our ESG and sustainability goals, or may encounter objections to them, either of which may
adversely affect public perception of our business and affect our relationship with our customers, our stockholders
and/or other stakeholders.
We have prioritized sustainability and ESG objectives, including long term goals of procuring 100% clean and renewable
energy coverage and reducing our GHG emissions from our operations and supply chain. We also face pressure from our
customers, stockholders and other stakeholders, such as the communities in which we operate, who are increasingly focused on
climate change, to prioritize renewable energy procurement, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices. To
address these goals and concerns, where possible, we plan to continue to scale our renewable energy strategy, seek low-carbon
alternatives for traditional fuel sources, use refrigerants that pose fewer risks of environmental impact, and pursue opportunities to
improve energy and water efficiency. As a result of these and other initiatives, we intend to make progress towards reducing our
environmental impact and global carbon footprint, as well as ensuring that our business remains viable in a low-carbon economy.
Pursing these objectives involves additional costs for conducting our business. For example, developing and acting on ESG
initiatives, including collecting, measuring, and reporting information, goals and other metrics can be costly, difficult and time
consuming. We have separately undertaken efforts to procure coverage from renewable energy projects in order to support
availability in new renewables development. These efforts to support and enhance renewable electricity generation may increase
our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred through procurement of conventional electricity from existing sources or
through conventional grids. Reducing our carbon footprint may require physical or operational modifications that may be costly.
These initiatives could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
There is also a risk that our ESG and sustainability objectives will not be successful. It is possible that we may fail to reach our
stated environmental goals in a timely manner or that our customers, stockholders or members of our communities might not be
satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. Our customers, shareholders or others may object to our ESG
and sustainability objectives or the manner in which we seek to achieve such objectives. A failure to meet our environmental goals,
or significant controversy regarding these goals, could adversely affect public perception of our business, employee morale or
customer, stockholder or community support. If we do not meet our customers' or stockholders' expectations regarding those
initiatives, or lose support in our communities, our business and/or our share price could be harmed.
There is some indication that ESG and sustainability goals are becoming more controversial, as some governmental entities in
the U.S. and certain investor constituencies question the appropriateness of or object to ESG and sustainability initiatives. Some
investors may use ESG-related factors to guide their investment strategies and may choose not to invest in us, a factor that would
tend to reduce demand for our shares and possibly affect our share price adversely. We also may face potential governmental
enforcement actions or private litigation challenging our ESG and sustainability goals, or our disclosure of those goals and our
metrics for measuring achievement of them. New or changing regulation or public opinion regarding our ESG and sustainability
goals or our actions to achieve them may result in adverse effects on our financial performance, reputation or demand for our
services and products, or may otherwise result in obligations and liabilities that cannot predicted or estimated at this time.
Risks Related to Certain Regulations and Laws, Including Tax Laws
Changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, including changes to tax rates, may adversely
affect our financial statements and cash taxes.
We are a U.S. company with global subsidiaries and are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. (although currently
limited due to our taxation as a REIT) and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
provision for income and other taxes. Although we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our potential tax
liabilities, and that our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no certainty that additional taxes will not be due upon audit of our
tax returns or as a result of changes to the tax laws
35
Table of Contents
and interpretations thereof. For example, we are currently undergoing audits in a number of jurisdictions where we operate. The
final results of these audits are uncertain and may not be resolved in our favor.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") is an international association made up of over 30
countries including the U.S. The OECD has proposed and made numerous changes to long-standing tax principles, which, if
adopted by the member countries, could have a materially adverse effect on our tax liabilities. For example, various foreign
jurisdictions are starting to explore the taxation of digital services and the mechanism of levying a top-up tax through the adoption
of OECD tax principles which could have a negative effect on our tax liability.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased spending by many governments. Because of this, there could be
pressure to increase taxes in the future to pay back debts and generate revenues. The nature and timing of any future changes to
each jurisdiction's tax laws and the impact on our future tax liabilities because of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reason
cannot be predicted with any accuracy but could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position or
cash flows.
Government regulation or failure to comply with laws and regulations may adversely affect our business.
Various laws and governmental regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, governing internet-related services, related
communications services and information technologies remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some
legislative action. For example, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") recently overturned network neutrality rules,
which may result in material changes in the regulations and contribution regime affecting us and our customers. Furthermore, the
U.S. Congress and state legislatures are reviewing and considering changes to the new FCC rules making the future of network
neutrality uncertain. Changes to these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us and our customers. There
may also be forthcoming regulation in the U.S. on a federal or state level in the areas of cybersecurity, data privacy, sustainability,
taxation and data security, any of which could impact us and our customers. Similarly, data privacy regulations continue to evolve
and must be addressed by Equinix as a global company.
Additionally, laws and regulations related to economic sanctions, export controls, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and other
international activities may restrict or limit our ability to engage in transactions or dealings with certain counterparties, in or with
certain countries or territories, or in certain activities. We cannot guarantee compliance with all such laws and regulations, and
failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us to fines, penalties, or costly and expensive investigations.
We remain focused on whether and how existing and changing laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy,
libel, telecommunications services, data flows/data localization, carbon emissions impact, competition and antitrust, and taxation
apply to our business and those which might have a material effect on our customers’ decisions to purchase our solutions.
Substantial resources may be required to comply with regulations or bring any non-compliant business practices into compliance
with such regulations. In addition, the continuing development of the market for online commerce and the displacement of
traditional telephony service by the internet and related communications services may prompt an increased call for more stringent
consumer protection laws or other regulation both in the U.S. and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies
conducting business online and their service providers.
Our business was designated "critical infrastructure" or "essential services" which allowed our data centers to remain open in
many jurisdictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any regulations restricting our ability to operate our business due to the COVID-
19 pandemic or for any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, these "essential services"
and "critical infrastructure" designations could lead countries or local regulators to impose additional regulations on the data center
industry in order to have better visibility and control over our industry for future events and crises.
We strive to comply with all laws and regulations that apply to our business. However, as these laws evolve, they can be
subject to varying interpretations and regulatory discretion. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of
these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to
civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect our business operations. The adoption, or modification of laws or regulations
relating to the internet and our business, or
36
Table of Contents
interpretations of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our complex global legal entity structure.
We maintain a complex global organizational structure, containing numerous legal entities of varied types and serving various
purposes, in each country in which we operate. For example, in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, a large portion of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from real estate. To facilitate
meeting this REIT compliance requirement, we use TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries ("QRSs") in order to segregate our
income between net income from real estate and net income from TRSs. This results in almost double the number of entities we
would typically need if we were not maintaining qualification as a REIT.
Additionally, we maintain certain other region-specific organizational structures for various tax, legal and other business
purposes. The organization, maintenance and reporting requirements for our entity structure are complex and require coordination
amongst many teams within Equinix and the use of outside service providers. While we use automation tools and software where
possible to manage this process, some work continues to be manual. We believe we have adequate controls in place to manage
these complex structures, but if our controls fail, there could be significant legal and tax implications to our business and our
operations including but not limited to material tax and legal liabilities.
Risks Related to Our REIT Status in the US
We may not remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. We believe that
our organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), such that we will continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that
we have qualified for taxation as a REIT or that we will remain so qualified. Qualification for taxation as a REIT involves the
application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code to our operations as well as various factual determinations
concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of
applicable REIT provisions of the Code.
If, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:
•we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•we will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; and
•we would not be eligible to elect REIT status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we
failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT.
Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. If we
fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any
additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced.
As a REIT, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax.
We paid quarterly distributions in each quarter of 2022 and have declared a quarterly distribution to be paid on March 22, 2023.
The amount, timing and form of any future distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our Board of
Directors. To remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited
circumstances, the following year, to our stockholders. Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable
income. If our cash available for distribution falls
37
Table of Contents
short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our REIT taxable income and may fail to
remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions
as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of
income and expenses for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures,
payments of compensation for which Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction, interest expense deductions limited by
Section 163(j) of the Code, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments.
To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will
be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4%
nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a
calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the Code.
Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.
To remain qualified for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other
things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders.
For example, under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or
more TRSs. Similar rules apply to other nonqualifying assets. These limitations may affect our ability to make large investments in
other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets. In addition, in order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we must
distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any
net capital gains. Even if we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at
regular corporate income tax rates for our undistributed REIT taxable income, as well as U.S. federal income tax at regular
corporate income tax rates for income recognized by our TRSs; we also pay taxes in the foreign jurisdictions in which our
international assets and operations are held and conducted regardless of our qualification for taxation as a REIT. Because of these
distribution requirements, we will likely not be able to fund future capital needs and investments from operating cash flow. As such,
compliance with REIT tests may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of significant
nonqualifying assets and the material expansion of non-real estate activities.
Our use of TRSs, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation
as a REIT in the U.S.
Our operations include using TRSs to facilitate meeting the REIT compliance requirements. The net income of our TRSs is not
fully included in our QRS, and income that is not included in our QRSs generally is not subject to the REIT income distribution
requirement. Our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our
qualification for taxation as a REIT. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived
from real estate. Consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other
nonqualifying types of income. Thus, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited and may impact our ability to
fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our TRSs.
Further, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of
significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes
(1) the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market
value of our securities in our TRSs and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we
will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. Further, a substantial portion of our TRSs are overseas, and a material change in
foreign currency rates could also negatively impact our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
The Code imposes limitations on the ability of our TRSs to utilize specified income tax deductions, including limits on the use of
net operating losses and limits on the deductibility of interest expense.
Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income
tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax
liabilities.
38
Table of Contents
Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes, including
taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could
in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in respect of dealer
property income or in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a
REIT.
A portion of our business is conducted through wholly-owned TRSs because certain of our business activities could generate
nonqualifying REIT income as currently structured and operated. The income of our U.S. TRSs will continue to be subject to federal
and state corporate income taxes. In addition, our international assets and operations will continue to be subject to taxation in the
foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. Any of these taxes would decrease our
earnings and our available cash.
We will also be subject to a U.S. federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax rate on gain
recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the
hands of a C corporation (such as an asset that we or our QRSs hold following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS).
This tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the
asset as a REIT asset, to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the
asset as a REIT asset.
Our certificate of incorporation contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock, though they may not be
successful in preserving our qualification for taxation as a REIT.
In order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may
be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year. In addition,
rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying REIT income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer,
whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the Code. Subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation
prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all
classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any
class or series of our capital stock. We refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our
certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with REIT tax rules. The constructive ownership rules under the Code are
complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively
owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the
outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another
individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our
common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically
transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. Even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can
be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a REIT from being jeopardized,
including under the affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the
ownership limits. If the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and, as a result, we fail to satisfy the REIT tax
rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
In addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might
involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, the overall effect of the
ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition
may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders.
General Risk Factors
The effects of the COVID-19 or any other pandemic could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.
We have continuously monitored our global operations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented procedures
focusing on the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and
39
Table of Contents
communities, the continuity of our business offerings and compliance with governmental regulations and local public health
guidance and ordinances. While our business operations have continued without interruption and our IBX data centers have
remained fully operational to date, we cannot guarantee our business operations or our IBX data centers will not be negatively
impacted in the future because of the COVID-19 or any other pandemic.
The market price of our stock may continue to be highly volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock
may decline.
The market price of the shares of our common stock has recently been and may continue to be highly volatile. General
economic and market conditions, like the ones we are currently experiencing, and market conditions for telecommunications, data
center and REIT stocks in general, may affect the market price of our common stock.
Announcements by us or others, or speculations about our future plans, may also have a significant impact on the market price
of our common stock. These may relate to:
•news or regulations regarding the ongoing COVID-19 or any other pandemic;
•our results of operations or forecasts;
•new issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt by us, including issuances through any existing ATM Program;
•increases in market interest rates and changes in other general market and economic conditions, including inflationary
concerns;
•changes to our capital allocation, tax planning or business strategy;
•our qualification for taxation as a REIT and our declaration of distributions to our stockholders;
•changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws;
•changes in management or key personnel;
•developments in our relationships with customers;
•announcements by our customers or competitors;
•changes in regulatory policy or interpretation;
•governmental investigations;
•changes in the ratings of our debt or stock by rating agencies or securities analysts;
•our purchase or development of real estate and/or additional IBX data centers;
•our acquisitions of complementary businesses; or
•the operational performance of our IBX data centers.
The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected
the market prices for telecommunications companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These
broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. One of the factors that investors may
consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative to
market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek
alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in the capital
markets may affect the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, companies that have experienced volatility in the market
price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future.
Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and/or damages, and divert management's attention from other
business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.
Inadequate or inaccurate external and internal information, including budget and planning data, could lead to inaccurate
financial forecasts and inappropriate financial decisions.
Our financial forecasts are dependent on estimates and assumptions regarding budget and planning data, market growth,
foreign exchange rates, our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to
reinvest in the business, fund internal growth, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet our debt obligations. Our financial
projections are based on historical experience and on various other
40
Table of Contents
assumptions that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made.
We continue to evolve our forecasting models as necessary and appropriate but if our predictions are inaccurate and our
results differ materially from our forecasts, we could make inappropriate financial decisions. Additionally, inaccuracies in our models
could adversely impact our compliance with REIT asset tests, future profitability, stock price and/or stockholder confidence.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strength of the U.S. dollar, in the markets in which we
operate internationally could harm our results of operations.
We have experienced and may continue to experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. To date, the majority of revenues and costs in our international operations are denominated in foreign currencies.
As we experienced in 2022, where our prices are denominated in U.S. Dollars, our sales and revenues could be adversely affected
by declines in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, thereby making our offerings more expensive in local currencies. We
are also exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our international
operations. To the extent we are paying contractors in foreign currencies, our operations could cost more than anticipated as a
result of declines in the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies. In addition, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates have a
direct impact on how our international results of operations translate into U.S. Dollars.
Although we currently undertake, and may decide in the future to further undertake, foreign exchange hedging transactions to
reduce foreign currency transaction exposure, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. In
addition, REIT compliance rules may restrict our ability to enter into hedging transactions. Therefore, any weakness of the U.S.
Dollar may have a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations because the currencies in the foreign countries in
which we operate may translate into more U.S. Dollars. However, as we have experienced more recently, if the U.S. Dollar
strengthens relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate, our consolidated financial position and results of
operations may be negatively impacted as amounts in foreign currencies will generally translate into fewer U.S. Dollars. For
additional information on foreign currency risks, refer to our discussion of foreign currency risk in "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk" included in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected.
Our most recent evaluation of our controls resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2022, in compliance with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective. Our ability to manage
our operations and growth through, for example, the integration of recently acquired businesses, the adoption of new accounting
principles and tax laws, and our overhaul of our back office systems that, for example, support the customer experience from initial
quote to customer billing and our revenue recognition process, will require us to further develop our controls and reporting systems
and implement or amend new or existing controls and reporting systems in those areas where the implementation and integration
is still ongoing. All of these changes to our financial systems and the implementation and integration of acquisitions create an
increased risk of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. If, in the future, our internal control over financial
reporting is found to be ineffective, or if a material weakness is identified in our controls over financial reporting, our financial results
may be adversely affected. Investors may also lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could adversely
affect our stock price.
Terrorist activity, or other acts of violence, including violence stemming from the current climate of political and
economic uncertainty, could adversely impact our business.
The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility both domestically and abroad by terrorist
organizations, organized crime organizations, or other criminals along with violence stemming from political unrest, contribute to a
climate of political and economic uncertainty in many of the regions in which we operate. Due to existing or developing
circumstances, we may need to incur additional costs in the future to provide enhanced security, including cyber security and
physical security, which could have a material adverse effect on our business
41
Table of Contents
and results of operations. These circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and
employees, our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our IBX data centers.
We may be subject to securities class action and other litigation, which may harm our business and results of operations.
We may be subject to securities class action or other litigation. For example, securities class action litigation has often been
brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive,
and divert management's attention and resources. Results cannot be predicted with certainty and an adverse outcome in litigation
could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief. Further, any payments made in settlement may directly reduce our revenue
under U.S. GAAP and could negatively impact our results of operations for the period. For all of these reasons, litigation could
seriously harm our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.
We cannot make assurances that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter
misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce
our intellectual property rights. We also are subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property
rights. Any such claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual
property or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the alleged infringement.
We have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts.
Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring
control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a stockholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include:
•ownership limitations and transfer restrictions relating to our stock that are intended to facilitate our compliance with certain
REIT rules relating to share ownership;
•authorization for the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock;
•the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors;
•limits on the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;
•limits on stockholder action by written consent; and
•advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by
stockholders at stockholder meetings.
In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts certain business combinations with
interested stockholders in certain situations, may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.

recent IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScale data center investments, have expanded our total global
footprint to 248 data centers, including 11 xScale data centers and the MC1 data center that are held in unconsolidated joint
ventures, across 71 markets around the world. We offer the following solutions:
•premium data center colocation;
•interconnection and data exchange solutions;
•edge solutions for deploying networking, security and hardware; and
•remote expert support and professional services.
Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery
performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly
reducing costs. Our global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, interconnection offerings and edge solutions have
enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and
performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers. This adjacency creates
a “network effect” that enables our customers to capture the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These
partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "marketplace" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable,
reliable and cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility.
Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and the resulting
"marketplace" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, has continued to drive new customer growth
and bookings.
Historically, our market was served by large telecommunications carriers who bundled their products and services with their
colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral multi-tenant data center
("MTDC") providers, hyperscale cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems
integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. Each
of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT
infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 32 countries with the industry’s largest
and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly
scalable set of offerings.
Our cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to
measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our
IBX data centers across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 82% and
79%, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected
markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We
perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and
cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing
amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits,
we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption
has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers.
We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available
within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our
financial performance, results of operations and cash flows.
To serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers, we
have entered into joint ventures to develop and operate xScale data centers. In the past two years, we have closed multiple joint
ventures in the form of limited liability partnerships with GIC Private Limited, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund ("GIC") and an
additional joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with PGIM Real Estate ("PGIM").TM

Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint
and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number
of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to
networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment
required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow
basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive
to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash
payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to our standards. Property expansion
may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or
acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be
significant.
Revenue:
Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed
infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring
basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length, and thereafter automatically
renews in one-year increments. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three
years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 90% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing
customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our recurring
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 39% of our recurring revenues for the years ended 2021 and 2020.
Our non-recurring revenues are primarily derived from fees charged from installations related to a customer's initial deployment
and professional services we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once,
upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are
typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from
installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract
settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and
recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring
revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future.
Operating Expenses:
Cost of Revenues. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX
data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-
based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment, and security. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in
nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire
new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies
that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the
summer months, as compared to other times of the year. Our costs of electricity may also increase as a result of the physical
52
Table of Contents
effects of climate change, global energy supply constraints, increased regulations driving alternative electricity generation due to
environmental considerations or as a result of our election to use renewable energy sources. To the extent we incur increased utility
costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and
marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations,
promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.
General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses,
including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees; and other general corporate expenses,
such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense on back office systems.
Taxation as a REIT
We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT") beginning with our 2015
taxable year. As of December 31, 2022, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico,
Chile, Japan, Singapore and the majority of our data centers in EMEA. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are
operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). We included our share of the assets in xScale joint ventures (with the exception of
Korea) in our REIT structure.
As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our
stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed,
if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT
compliant is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes, as applicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to
be subject to local income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or
conducted through TRSs or through qualified REIT subsidiaries ("QRSs"). We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate
income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis
of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a
former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the
date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the
date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. In addition, should we recognize any net gain from "prohibited transactions," we will be
subject to tax on this net gain at a 100% rate. "Prohibited transactions," for this purpose, are defined as dispositions, at a gain, of
inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of
foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal
income taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if we remain
qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our
income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes
often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not
follow them at all.
We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT.
For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT
structure in future periods.
On each of March 23, June 15, September 21, and December 14, 2022 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $3.10 per share.
We expect the amount of all our applicable quarterly dividend distributions and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed our
REIT taxable income that we recognized in 2022.
The Impact of the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Results and Operations
We have continued to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our people and business. As of the time of this
filing, our offices are open to employees and we have also resumed in-person events as local travel restrictions allow.

Revenues
(dollars in thousands)
Americas Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas revenue increased by $327.5 million or 11% (and
also 11% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to:
•approximately $30.3 million of incremental revenues generated from the Entel Chile and Entel Peru acquisitions;
•$44.6 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions; and
•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.
EMEA Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA revenue increased by $188.0 million or 9% (12% on a
constant currency basis). Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to:
•$59.6 million of incremental revenues generated from the MainOne acquisition;
•approximately $32.0 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions;
•$9.3 million of incremental revenues from services provided to our joint ventures; and
•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.
Asia-Pacific Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific revenue increased by $112.1 million or 8%
(16% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Asia-Pacific revenues was primarily due to:
•approximately $60.2 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions;
•$14.3 million incremental revenues generated from the GPX India acquisition; and
•incremental revenues generated from power price increases in Singapore in response to the increased cost of utilities as
noted below.

Americas Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas cost of revenues increased by
$102.1 million or 7% (and also 7% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due
to:
•$48.5 million of higher utilities, primarily driven by comparatively lower costs in 2021 resulting from gains recognized from
wind farm settlements in Texas and Oklahoma due to extreme weather conditions, current period increases in power costs,
higher utility usage and IBX data center expansions;
•$20.1 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to
headcount growth;
•$15.2 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Entel Chile and Entel Peru acquisitions; and
•$10.9 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions.
EMEA Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA cost of revenues increased by $64.0 million or 5%
(11% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to:
•$35.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the MainOne Acquisition; and
•after accounting for changes in foreign currency rates and hedge loss allocations:
◦approximately $13 million in utilities costs, primarily driven by increases in power costs and higher utility usage in
France and the United Kingdom;
◦approximately $11 million in depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions; and
◦approximately $7 million in compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation,
primarily due to headcount growth.

Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased by
$112.9 million or 14% (24% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to:
•$99.5 million of higher utilities primarily driven by increases in power cost and higher utility usage in Singapore;
•$11.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the GPX India acquisition;
•$10.3 million of higher rent and facilities costs, primarily in Hong Kong; and
•$8.1 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions in Singapore.
This increase was partially offset by $13.6 million of lower other cost of revenue, primarily due to decreased customer installations.
We expect Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase in line with the growth of our business, including
from the impacts of acquisitions.
Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were

Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas sales and marketing expenses
increased by $31.0 million or 7% (and also 7% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas sales and marketing
expenses was primarily due to:
•$18.0 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation,
partially due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and headcount growth; and
•$8.0 million of higher travel and entertainment expenses due to the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions.

EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA sales and marketing increased by
$10.8 million or 6% (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily
due to higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation, partially due to
additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and headcount growth.
Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense did not materially change during
the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
We anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives across our three regions in line with the growth of
our business. We expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than those of our
other regions since certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the U.S.
General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022

(dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)
Americas General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas general and
administrative expenses increased by $78.6 million or 9% (and also 9% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our
Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:
•$46.8 million of higher depreciation expense associated with back-office systems to support the growth of our business;
•$40.7 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to
additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and headcount growth;
•$24.0 million of higher office expenses primarily due to additional software and support services; and
•$10.4 million of higher travel and entertainment expenses due to the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions.
59
Table of Contents
This increase was partially offset by $40.9 million of lower consulting costs driven by an increase in the conversion of contingent
workers to full time employees.
EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA general and administrative
expenses increased by $53.0 million or 21% (27% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to:
•$34.0 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to
headcount growth; and
•$10.0 million higher travel and entertainment expenses due to the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions.
Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific general and
administrative expenses increased by $65.3 million or 43% (51% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific
general and administrative expense was primarily due to:
•$39.5 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to
headcount growth; and
•$28.5 million of higher consulting costs in support of our business growth and location strategy.
Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our general and administrative expenses to
increase across all three regions as we continue to invest in our operations to support our growth, including investments to
enhance our technology platform, and to integrate recent acquisitions. Additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located
in the U.S., we expect the Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than that of
other regions.
Transaction Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded transaction costs totaling $21.8 million, primarily
related to costs incurred in connection with the recent acquisitions and formation of the new joint ventures, see Notes 3, 5, and 6
within the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded transaction costs totaling
$22.8 million, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of the new joint ventures and the GPX India
Acquisition.
Gain or Loss on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not record a significant amount of loss on
asset sales. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain of $10.8 million primarily related to the sale of the
Dublin 5 ("DB5") data center.

$118.6 million or 72% (71% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center
expansion activity, the recent acquisitions and organic growth, as described above.
EMEA Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA income from operations increased by $44.4
million or 8% (3% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion
activity, the recent acquisition and organic growth, as described above.
Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific income from operations
decreased by $70.7 million or 17% (10% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher operating

expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included higher utility costs, primarily driven by increases in power prices and higher
utility usage, as described above.
Interest Income. Interest income was $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was not significant for the year
ended December 31, 2021. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1.74% versus 0.17% for the year ended
December 31, 2021.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $356.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $336.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the issuance of the 3.900% Senior Notes due 2032. During the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, we capitalized $18.2 million and $24.5 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in
progress. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Expense. We recorded net other expense of $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, including
$49.0 million in stock-based charitable contributions and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, we recorded net other expense of $50.6 million, primarily due to an approximately $32.0 million impairment
charge resulting from the settlement of a pre-acquisition uncertain tax position, refer to the "Income Taxes" section below for further
information, as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
Gain or Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We did not record a significant amount of gain on debt extinguishment during the
year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $115.1 million of net loss on debt
extinguishment primarily due to the redemption of 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2026 and the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027.
Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S.
federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire
taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. As such, other than state income taxes and foreign income and withholding taxes, no provision for income taxes has
been included for our REIT and QRSs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021.
We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that
would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that may not be REIT compliant.
U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of
whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $124.8 million and $109.2 million of income tax expenses,
respectively. Our effective tax rates were 15.0% and 17.9%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The
lower effective tax rate in 2022 as compared to 2021 is primarily driven by the higher U.S. QRS income that is not subject to U.S.
corporate income taxes, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances in the Americas region.
In the current period, we had a favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of approximately $40.0 million resulting from the
settlement of tax audits in the EMEA region. In the prior period, we had a favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of
approximately $70.0 million resulting from the settlement of various tax audits in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Of the
unrecognized tax benefits realized in the prior period, approximately $32.0 million was related to the uncertain tax position inherited
from the acquisition of Metronode in 2018. The uncertain tax position was covered by an indemnification agreement with the Seller.
The realization of the unrecognized tax benefits resulted in an impairment of the indemnification asset for the same amount, which
was included in Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop
regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding
income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment,
depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction
costs, and gain or loss on asset sales. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA
and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to

Americas Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased by $195.3
million or 15% (and also 15% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center
expansion activity, the recent acquisitions and organic growth, as described above.
EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by $76.2 million or
7% (10% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, the
recent acquisition and organic growth, as described above.
Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA decreased by $46.2
million or 6% (2% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher utility costs, as described above.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing results of operations
may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to
evaluate our operations.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate
our results of operations in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We
believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and
provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We
believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze
us effectively.
Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures,
and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when
comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies.
Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO"), exclude
depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect
our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an
economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center,
although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital
expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also
based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are
based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital
expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our results of operations when evaluating our operations.
62
Table of Contents
In addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets.
Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in
amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating
performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations
as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in
evaluating our current operations. We also exclude restructuring charges. Restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit
leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse
such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges generally related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment
charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in
evaluating the current or future operating performance. Additionally, we exclude transaction costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA
to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs we
incur in connection with business combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation,
and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing our long-term performance. In
addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions.
Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and transaction costs
are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods. Finally, we exclude stock-based
compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, and the timing, size and nature of
equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our results
of operations with those of other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or
expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense,
restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset sales as presented below (in thousands):

Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,369,700 $ 3,144,384 $ 2,852,898 
Our adjusted EBITDA results have increased each year in total dollars due to the increase in our operating results, as
discussed in "Results of Operations", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a
cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature, as also discussed in "Overview".

Funds from Operations ("FFO") and AFFO
We use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in
accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net
income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets
and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.
In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating
performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-
based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an
installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred
financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment,
recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for
unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-
line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results
in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and
premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future
cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in
connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or
future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to
changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We
deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets
that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which
represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.

Constant Currency Presentation
Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative
expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total
revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to
be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2022 as
compared to the same period in 2021, the U.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Australian dollar, British Pound, Euro, Japanese
yen and Singapore dollar, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted
EBITDA, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared
to the same period in 2021, the U.S. dollar was weaker relative to the Brazilian real, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency
impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. In
order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant
currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our
foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure
and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this
non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations. To present this
information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the
respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2021 are used as exchange rates for the year
ended December 31, 2022 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash
Customer collections are our primary source of cash. We believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to
experience relatively strong collections. As of December 31, 2022, our principle sources of liquidity were $1.9 billion of cash and
cash equivalents. In addition to our cash balance, we had $3.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $4.0
billion revolving facility and general access to both public and private debt and the equity capital markets. We also have additional
liquidity available to us from our 2022 ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time our common stock in "at
the market" transactions on either a spot or forward basis. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.4 billion available for sale under
the 2022 ATM Program.
We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and external financing
sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, distribution
of dividends, completion of our publicly-announced acquisitions, ordinary costs to operate the business, and expansion projects.
As we continue to grow, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in
certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint
ventures. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support
this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures provided that we have or can access
sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities. We may elect to access the equity or debt markets from time to time
opportunistically, particularly if financing is available on attractive terms. We will continue to evaluate our operating requirements
and financial resources in light of future developments.

Net cash provided by financing activities 856,766 413,765 443,001 
Operating Activities
Our cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues.
Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general
corporate expenditures and taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $416.0 million during the year ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily driven by improved results of operations partially offset by
increases in cash paid for costs and operating expenses.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $356.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of $805.5 million spent on the Entel Chile and Peru data center acquisitions and
the MainOne acquisition, an increase of $46.4 million spent on real estate acquisitions and a $37.1 million increase in purchases of
investments. This increase was partially offset by a $473.5 million decrease in capital expenditures, a $41.3 million increase in the
proceeds from the sale of assets to our xScale Joint Ventures and an $18.0 million increase in proceeds from the sale of
investments.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $443.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a $2.0 billion decrease in the repayment of senior notes, a $676.9 million increase in
proceeds from term loan facilities, a $298.1 million increase in proceeds from the ATM program, a $129.1 million decrease in the
repayment of mortgage and loans payable, a $99.2 million decrease in debt extinguishment costs, a $31.3 million decrease in
repayments of finance lease liabilities, a $7.4 million decrease in debt issuance costs and a $3.9 million increase in proceeds from
employee awards. This increase is partially offset by a $2.7 billion decrease in proceeds from senior notes and a $108.6 million
increase in dividend distributions.
Material Cash Commitments
As of December 31, 2022, our principle commitments were primarily comprised of:
•approximately $12.2 billion of principal from our senior notes (gross of debt issuance cost and debt discount);
•approximately $3.0 billion of interest on mortgage payable, loans payable, senior notes and term loans, based on their
respective interest rates and recognized over the life of these instruments, and the credit facility fee for the revolving credit
facility;
•$653.6 million of principal from our term loans, mortgage and loans payable (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount,
plus mortgage premium);
•approximately $5.4 billion of total lease payments, which represents lease payments under finance and operating lease
arrangements, including renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised;
•approximately $1.6 billion of unaccrued capital expenditure contractual commitments, primarily for IBX equipment not yet
delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open IBX data
center expansion projects prior to making them available to customers for installation, the majority of which is payable
within the next 12 months; and
•approximately $1.8 billion of other non-capital purchase commitments, such as commitments to purchase power in select
locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services
67
Table of Contents
or arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2023 and beyond, the majority of which is payable within the next two
years.
We believe that our sources of liquidity, including our expected future operating cash flows, are sized to adequately meet both
the near and long term material cash commitments for the foreseeable future. For further information on maturities of lease
liabilities and debt instruments, see Notes 10 and 11, respectively, within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Contractual Obligations
We have additional future equity contributions and commitments to the joint ventures with GIC and PGIM. For additional
information, see the "Equity Method Investments" footnote within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which
have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2022. For additional information, see “Maturities of Lease Liabilities” in Note 10
within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies,
assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance
with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events
and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such
differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need
to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:
•    Accounting for income taxes;
•    Accounting for business combinations;
•    Accounting for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;
•    Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and
•    Accounting for leases.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Accounting for Income T axes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the future tax
consequences attributable to temporary
differences that exist between the
financial statement carrying value of
assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases, as well as tax attributes such
as operating loss, capital loss and tax
credit carryforwards on a taxing
jurisdiction basis. W e measure deferred
tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates that will apply in the years in which
we expect the temporary dif ferences to be
recovered or settled.
 
The accounting standard for income taxes
requires a reduction of the carrying
amounts of deferred tax assets by
recording a valuation allowance if, based
on the available evidence, it is more likely
than not (defined by the accounting
standard as a likelihood of more than
50%) that such assets will not be realized.
A tax benefit from an uncertain income
tax position may be recognized in the
financial statements only if it is more likely
than not that the position is sustainable,
based solely on its technical merits and
consideration of the relevant taxing
authority's widely understood
administrative practices and precedents.
We recognize interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits
within income tax benefit (expense) in the
consolidated statements of operations.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires
judgment in assessing the likely future tax
consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements or tax
returns. Our accounting for deferred tax
consequences represents our best estimate of
those future tax consequences.
In assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, we consider both positive and
negative evidence related to the likelihood of
realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based
on the weight of that available evidence, it is
more likely than not the deferred tax assets will
not be realized, we record a valuation
allowance. The weight given to the positive
and negative evidence is commensurate with
the extent to which the evidence may be
objectively verified.
This assessment, which is completed on a
taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a
number of types of evidence, including the
following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity
of current and cumulative financial reporting
losses, 2) sources of future taxable income, 3)
taxable income in carryback years permitted
by the tax law , and 4) tax planning strategies.
In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain
income tax position, the tax position that meets
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
is initially and subsequently measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that
has full knowledge of all relevant information.
For purposes of the quarterly REIT  asset tests,
we estimate the fair market value of assets
within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted
cash flow approach, by calculating the present
value of forecasted future cash flows. W e
apply discount rates based on industry
benchmarks relative to the market and
forecasting risks. Other significant
assumptions used to estimate the fair market
value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include
projected revenue growth, projected operating
margins and projected capital expenditure. W e
revisit significant assumptions periodically to
reflect any changes due to business or
economic environment.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net total
deferred tax liabilities of $338.7 million and $280.5
million, respectively . As of December 31, 2022 and
2021, we had a total valuation allowance of $166.6
million and $100.7 million, respectively . If and when
we increase or reduce our valuation allowances, it
may have an unfavorable or favorable impact,
respectively , to our financial position and results of
operations in the periods when such determinations
are made. W e will continue to assess the need for our
valuation allowances, by jurisdiction, in the future.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we
established full valuation allowances against certain
deferred tax assets in the Americas and EMEA
regions, either as the assessment of the realization of
such deferred tax assets or as part of the purchase
accounting determination for the businesses we
acquired during the year . We do not expect these
deferred tax assets to be realizable in the foreseeable
future.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we
established full valuation allowances against certain
deferred tax assets in the Americas and Asia-Pacific
regions, as these deferred tax assets are not
expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had
unrecognized tax benefits of $89.2 million and $148.3
million, respectively , exclusive of interest and
penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
the unrecognized tax benefit decreased by $59.1
million primarily due to the settlements of tax audits in
the EMEA  region. During the year ended December
31, 2021, the unrecognized tax benefit decreased by
$59.5 million primarily due to the settlements of
various tax audits in the EMEA  and Asia-Pacific
regions. The unrecognized tax benefits of $89.2
million as of December 31, 2022, if subsequently
recognized, will af fect our ef fective tax rate favorably
at the time when such a benefit is recognized.

Accounting for Business
Combinations
In accordance with the accounting
standard for business combinations, we
allocate the purchase price of an acquired
business to its identifiable assets and
liabilities based on estimated fair values.
The excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, if any , is recorded as
goodwill.
 
We use all available information to
estimate fair values. W e typically engage
outside appraisal firms to assist in
determining the fair value of identifiable
intangible assets such as customer
contracts, leases and any other significant
assets or liabilities and contingent
consideration, as well as the estimated
useful life of intangible assets. W e adjust
the preliminary purchase price allocation,
as necessary , up to one year after the
acquisition closing date if we obtain more
information regarding asset valuations
and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology
contains uncertainties because it requires
assumptions and management's judgment to
estimate the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key
judgments used to estimate the fair value of
intangible assets include projected revenue
growth and operating margins, discount rates,
customer attrition rates, as well as the
estimated useful life of intangible assets.
Management estimates the fair value of assets
and liabilities based upon quoted market
prices, the carrying value of the acquired
assets and widely accepted valuation
techniques, including discounted cash flows
and market multiple analyses. Our estimates
are inherently uncertain and subject to
refinement. Unanticipated events or
circumstances may occur which could af fect
the accuracy of our fair value estimates,
including assumptions regarding industry
economic factors and business strategies.During the last three years, we have completed a
number of business combinations, including the
acquisition of Entel Peru data centers in the third
quarter of 2022, MainOne in W est Africa and Entel
Chile data centers, both in the second quarter of
2022, GPX in India in the third quarter of 2021, Bell
data centers in Canada in the fourth quarter of 2020,
Packet in March 2020 and Axtel in Mexico in January
2020. The purchase price allocation for these
acquisitions has been finalized, except for the
MainOne, Entel Peru and Entel Chile acquisitions.
As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net
intangible assets of $1.9 billion, respectively . We
recorded amortization expense for intangible assets
of $204.8 million, $205.5 million and $199.0 million for
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively .
 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood
that there will be a material change in the estimates
or assumptions we used to complete the purchase
price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. However , if actual results are
not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we
may be exposed to losses or gains that could be
material, which would be recorded in our consolidated
statements of operations in 2022 or beyond.

Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets
In accordance with the accounting
standard for goodwill and other intangible
assets, we perform goodwill and other
intangible assets impairment reviews
annually , or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of an asset may not be recoverable.
 
We complete the annual goodwill
impairment assessment for the Americas,
EMEA  and Asia-Pacific reporting units to
determine if the fair values of the
reporting units exceeded their carrying
values.
 
We perform a review of other intangible
assets for impairment by assessing
events or changes in circumstances that
indicate the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable.To perform annual goodwill impairment
assessment, we elected to assess qualitative
factors to determine whether it is more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying value. This analysis
requires assumptions and estimates before
performing the quantitative goodwill
impairment test, where the assessment
requires assumptions and estimates derived
from a review of our actual and forecasted
operating results, approved business plans,
future economic conditions and other market
data. Additionally , we periodically review our
assessment of our reporting units to determine
if changes in facts and circumstances warrant
changes to our conclusions. There were no
specific factors present in 2022 or 2021 that
indicated a potential goodwill impairment.
We performed our annual review of other
intangible assets by assessing if there were
events or changes in circumstances indicating
that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable, such as a significant decrease
in market price of an asset, a significant
adverse change in the extent or manner in
which an asset is being used, a significant
adverse change in legal factors or business
climate that could af fect the value of an asset
or a continuous deterioration of our financial
condition. This assessment requires
assumptions and estimates derived from a
review of our actual and forecasted operating
results, approved business plans, future
economic conditions and other market data.
There were no specific events in 2022 or 2021
that indicated a potential impairment.As of December 31, 2022, goodwill attributable to the
Americas, the EMEA  and the Asia-Pacific reporting
units was $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $0.6 billion,
respectively .
Future events, changing market conditions and any
changes in key assumptions may result in an
impairment charge. While we have not recorded an
impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the
development of adverse business conditions in our
Americas, EMEA  or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such
as higher than anticipated customer churn
or significantly increased operating costs, or
significant deterioration of our market comparables
that we use in the market approach, could result in an
impairment charge in future periods.
The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for
both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
$1.9 billion. While we have not recorded an
impairment charge against our other intangible assets
to date, future events or changes in circumstances,
such as a significant decrease in market price of an
asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or
manner in which an asset is being used, a significant
adverse change in legal factors or business climate,
may result in an impairment charge in future periods.

Accounting for Property , Plant and
Equipment
We have a substantial amount of
property , plant and equipment recorded
on our consolidated balance sheet. The
vast majority of our property , plant and
equipment represent the costs incurred to
build out or acquire our IBX data centers.
Our IBX data centers are long-lived
assets. W e depreciate our property , plant
and equipment using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets (subject to the term
of the lease in the case of leased assets
or leasehold improvements and integral
equipment located in leased properties).
Accounting for property , plant and
equipment includes determining the
appropriate period in which to depreciate
such assets, assessing such assets for
potential impairment, capitalizing interest
during periods of construction and
assessing the asset retirement obligations
required for certain leased properties that
require us to return the leased properties
back to their original condition at the time
we decide to exit a leased property .Judgments are required in arriving at the
estimated useful life of an asset and changes
to these estimates would have significant
impact on our financial position and results of
operations. When we lease a property for our
IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-
term arrangements with renewal options
generally available to us. In the next several
years, a number of leases for our IBX data
centers will come up for renewal. As we start
approaching the end of these initial lease
terms, we will need to reassess the estimated
useful lives of our property , plant and
equipment. In addition, we may find that our
estimates for the useful lives of non-leased
assets may also need to be revised
periodically . We periodically review the
estimated useful lives of certain of our
property , plant and equipment and changes in
these estimates in the future are possible.
The assessment of long-lived assets for
impairment requires assumptions and
estimates of undiscounted and discounted
future cash flows. These assumptions and
estimates require significant judgment and are
inherently uncertain.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had property ,
plant and equipment of $16.6 billion and $15.4 billion,
respectively . During the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded depreciation
expense of $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.2 billion,
respectively . While we evaluated the appropriateness,
we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our
property , plant and equipment during the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Further changes
in our estimated useful lives of our property , plant and
equipment could have a significant impact on our
results of operations.
Accounting for Leases
A significant portion of our data center
spaces, of fice spaces and equipment are
leased. Each time we enter into a new
lease or lease amendments, we analyze
each lease or lease amendment for the
proper accounting, including determining
if an arrangement is or contains a lease at
inception and making assessment of the
leased properties to determine if they are
operating or finance leases.Determination of accounting treatment,
including the result of the lease classification
test for each new lease or lease amendment,
is dependent on a variety of judgments, such
as identification of lease and non-lease
components, allocation of total consideration
between lease and non-lease components,
determination of lease term, including
assessing the likelihood of lease renewals,
valuation of leased property , and establishing
the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the
present value of the minimum lease payment
for the lease test. The judgments used in the
accounting for leases are inherently subjective;
different assumptions or estimates could result
in dif ferent accounting treatment for a lease.Lease assumptions and estimates are determined
and applied at the inception of the leases or at the
lease modification date. As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, operating right-of-use ("ROU") lease
assets were at $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion,
respectively , and operating lease liabilities were at
$1.4 billion and $1.3 billion respectively . As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, finance ROU assets
were $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively , and
finance lease liabilities were $2.3 billion and
$2.1 billion, respectively . For the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded the
finance lease cost of $273.6 million, $275.0 million
and $233.9 million , respectively , and recorded rent
expense of approximately $213.6 million, $221.8
million and $217.3 million, respectively .

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market Risk
The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.
We employ foreign currency forward and option contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate locks for the
purpose of hedging certain specifically identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of
the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Investment Portfolio Risk
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset
requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair
values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge
for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent
and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will
recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with
credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market
funds. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $764.6 million.
Interest Rate Risk 
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate increase or decrease in current interest
rates from their position as of December 31, 2022 would not have a material impact on our interest expense due to the fixed
coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and
term loans that bear interest at variable rates could be affected. For every 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates,
our annual interest expense could increase by approximately $6.1 million or decrease by approximately $6.1 million based on the
total balance of our term loan borrowings as of December 31, 2022.
We periodically enter into interest rate locks to hedge the interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed rate debt
issuances, which are designated as cash flow hedges. When interest rate locks are settled, any accumulated gain or loss included
as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the forecasted hedged
transaction which is equivalent to the term of the interest rate locks. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge our interest rate
risk in our variable rate debt obligations by changing the benchmark rate for a portion of the variable rate debt obligations from
SONIA to SOFR. As of December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of such cross-currency interest rate swaps was
$280.3 million.
The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest
rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value
of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable, which
are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same
remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The fair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based
on quoted market prices. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans
payable and senior notes as of (in thousands):

The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount and debt premium.
Foreign Currency Risk
To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging
programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region as
well as our debt denominated in foreign-currencies, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the re-measurement of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net investment hedging program to hedge the long
term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency
exchange rate movements and their impact on the consolidated statements of operations.
We have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the total principal amount of foreign
currency debt obligations was $1.8 billion, including $1.2 billion denominated in Euro and $603.9 million denominated in British
Pound. As of December 31, 2022, we have designated $1.5 billion of the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations
as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value
of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income
(loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar
will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the
U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, we
estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt obligations in U.S. Dollars would have increased
or decreased by approximately $197.9 million and $161.9 million, respectively.
We are also party to cross-currency interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amounts of
cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, which have been designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries,
were $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. If the U.S. Dollar weakened or strengthened
by 10% in comparison to foreign currencies, we estimate our obligation to cash settle these hedges would have increased or
decreased by approximately $375.6 million and $307.3 million, respectively.
The U.S. Dollar strengthened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate during the year
ended December 31, 2022. This has impacted our consolidated financial position and results of operations during this period,
including the amount of revenues that we reported. Continued strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar will continue to impact
us in future periods.
With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar during the year
ended December 31, 2022 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and a reduction of our operating expenses including
depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $222.1 million and $220.8 million, respectively.
With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar during the year ended
December 31, 2022 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and an increase of our operating expenses including
depreciation and amortization expenses, by approximately $284.3 million and $283.7 million, respectively.(1) (1)

Commodity Price Risk
Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices.
The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies
and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into
various power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the U.S.
In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building
materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure
certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the
construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase
the cost of these projects.
We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the
power contracts discussed above.
ITEM 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
The financial statements and supplementary data required by this Item 8 are listed in Item 15(a)(1) and begin at page F-1 of

ITEM 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
There is no disclosure to report pursuant to Item 9.
ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-
15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.
Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein
on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Table of Contents
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed and operated to be effective at the reasonable assurance
level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of
any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In the third quarter of 2022, as part of our multi-year project to move the backbone of our finance systems to the cloud, we
completed deployment of certain modules in our new cloud enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system to support the financial
close and our reporting requirements. As a result of the ERP system implementation, certain internal controls over financial
reporting have been automated, modified, or implemented to address the new control environment and processes associated with
the ERP system.
There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Equinix, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equinix, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income
(loss), of stockholders' equity and other comprehensive income (loss) and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Table of Contents
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Income taxes - Real estate investment trust asset tests
As described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded income tax expense of $124.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company has been operating as a real estate investment trust for federal
income tax purposes ("REIT") effective January 1, 2015. As a result, the Company may deduct the dividends made to its
stockholders from taxable income generated by the Company and its qualified REIT subsidiaries ("QRSs"). The Company’s
qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on its satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder
ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. The Company’s ability to satisfy quarterly asset tests depends upon its
analysis and the fair market values of its REIT and non-REIT assets. For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, management
estimates the fair market value of assets within its QRSs and taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) using a discounted cash flow
approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. Management applies discount rates based on industry
benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used by management to estimate the fair
market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins, and projected capital
expenditures. Management revisits significant assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to the business or economic
environment.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes - REIT asset tests is a
critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair market value of REIT and non-REIT
assets, which in turn led to a high degree of subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the REIT asset tests, (ii) the significant
audit effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the significant assumptions used in the REIT asset tests related to
the discount rates, projected revenue growth, projected operating margins, and projected capital expenditures, and (iii) the audit
effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion
on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the REIT asset
tests, including controls over management's determination of the fair market value of REIT and non-REIT assets. These
procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the fair market value of the REIT and non-
REIT assets; evaluating the appropriateness of the
F-2
Table of Contents
discounted cash flow approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating
the significant assumptions used by management related to the discount rates, projected revenue growth, projected operating
margins, and projected capital expenditures. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to projected revenue growth, projected
operating margins, and projected capital expenditures involved considering the current and past performance of the Company,
economic and industry trends, as well as whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the
audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash
flow approach and the discount rate assumptions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Business
Equinix, Inc. ("Equinix," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") was incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1998. Equinix provides
colocation space and related offerings. Global enterprises, content providers, financial companies and network service providers
rely upon Equinix's insight and expertise to safehouse and connect their most valued information assets. We operate International
Business Exchange ("IBX") data centers, or IBX data centers, across the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA")
and Asia-Pacific geographic regions where customers directly interconnect with a network ecosystem of partners and customers.
More than 2,000 network service providers offer access to the world's internet routes inside our IBX data centers. This access to
internet routes provides Equinix customers improved reliability and streamlined connectivity while significantly reducing costs by
reaching a critical mass of networks within a centralized physical location. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 236 IBX data
centers in 71 markets around the world.
We have been operating as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes ("REIT") effective January 1, 2015.
See "Income Taxes" in Note 14 below for additional information.
Basis of Presentation, Consolidation and Foreign Currency
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Equinix and its subsidiaries, including the
acquisitions of:
•Three data centers in Mexico acquired from Axtel S.A.B. de C.V ("Axtel") from January 8, 2020;
•Packet Host, Inc. (“Packet”), including its operations and technology, from March 2, 2020;
•12 data center sites across Canada from BCE Inc. ("Bell") from October 1, 2020 and one additional data center site from
November 2, 2020;
•Two data center sites in Mumbai, India from GPX India ("GPX India Acquisition") from September 1, 2021;
•Four data centers as well as a subsea cable and terrestrial fiber network in West Africa acquired from MainOne Cable
Company ("MainOne") from April 1, 2022; and
•Four data centers in Chile and a data center in Peru acquired from Empresa Nacional De Telecomunicaciones S.A.
("Entel") from May 2, 2022 and August 1, 2022, respectively.
We consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity but control,
including Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") for which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investment in consolidated VIEs have not
been material to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions,
including intercompany foreign currency transactions, that are anticipated to be repaid within the foreseeable future, are reported
within other income (expense) on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For additional information on the
impact of foreign currencies to our consolidated financial statements, see "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss" in Note 12.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair values
of financial and derivative instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, assets acquired and liabilities assumed from acquisitions,
useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, leases, asset retirement obligations, other accruals, and income
taxes.TM ®

EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
We consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market mutual funds and certificates of deposit with original maturities up to 90
days. Short-term investments generally consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities of between 90 days and 1 year.
Publicly traded equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in the fair values recognized within other income
(expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. We review our investment portfolio quarterly to determine if any securities
may be other-than-temporarily impaired due to increased credit risk, changes in industry or sector of a certain instrument or ratings
downgrades.
Equity Method Investments
We enter into joint venture or partnership arrangements to invest in certain entities for business development objectives. At the
inception of these arrangements and if a reconsideration event has occurred, we assess our interests with such entities to
determine whether any of the entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). A VIE is an entity that either (i) has
insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (ii) has equity
investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. We are required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of
VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that meets both of the
following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii)
has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. For
VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary, and other joint ventures or partnerships that are not VIEs, where we have the ability
to exercise significant influence over the entity, we account for those investments under the equity method of accounting.
Equity method investments are initially measured at cost, or at fair value when the investment represents a retained equity
interest in a deconsolidated business or derecognized distinct non-financial assets. Equity investments are subsequently adjusted
for cash contributions, distributions and our share of the income and losses of the investees. We record our equity method
investments in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Our proportionate shares of the income or loss from our equity
method investments are recorded in other income in the consolidated statement of operations.
We review our investments quarterly to determine if any investments may be impaired considering both qualitative and
quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investees' fair value. We did not record any impairment charges
related to our equity method investments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. For further information on our
Equity Method Investments, see Note 6.
Non-marketable Equity Investments
We also have investments in non-marketable equity securities, where we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over the investees. We elected the measurement alternative under which the securities are measured at cost minus
impairment, if any, and adjusted for changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. We record non-marketable equity
investment in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. We review our non-marketable equity investments quarterly to
determine if any investments may be impaired considering both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant
impact on the investees' fair value. We did not record any impairment charges related to our non-marketable equity investments for
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-
term investments and accounts receivable. Risks associated with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are
mitigated by our investment policy, which limits our investing to only those marketable securities rated at least A-1/P-1 Short Term
Rating or A-/A3 Long Term Rating, as determined by independent credit rating agencies.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at our original cost or initial fair value for property, plant and equipment acquired
through acquisitions, net of depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets. Buildings under finance leases, Leasehold improvements and integral equipment at leased locations are
amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement.
We capitalize certain internal and external costs associated with the development and purchase of internal-use software in
property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. This includes costs incurred in cloud computing
arrangements ("CCA"), where it is both feasible and contractually permissible without significant penalty for us to take possession
of the software. All other CCAs are considered service contracts, and the licensing and implementation costs incurred associated
with such contracts are capitalized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized internal-use software costs and
capitalized implementation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software or
arrangements.
Our estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are generally as follows:
Core systems 3-40 years
Buildings 12-60 years
Leasehold improvements 12-40 years
Personal Property, including capitalized internal-use software 3-10 years
Our construction in progress includes direct and indirect expenditures for the construction and expansion of IBX data centers
and is stated at original cost. We contracted out substantially all of the construction and expansion efforts of our IBX data centers to
independent contractors under construction contracts. Construction in progress includes costs incurred under construction
contracts including project management services, engineering and schematic design services, design development, construction
services and other construction-related fees and services. In addition, we capitalized interest costs during the construction phase.
Once an IBX data center or expansion project becomes operational, these capitalized costs are allocated to certain property, plant
and equipment categories and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets.
We review our property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset or an asset group may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset,
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or an asset group is being used or its physical condition, a
significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an asset group or a
continuous deterioration of our financial condition. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is assessed by
comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset or the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group exceeds its estimated
undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or the
asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset. We did not record any impairment charges related to our property, plant and
equipment during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

We enter into non-cancellable lease arrangements as the lessee primarily for our data center spaces, office spaces and
equipment. Assets acquired through finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance
sheets. In addition, a portion of our property, plant and equipment are used for revenue arrangements which are accounted for as
operating leases where we are the lessor.
Assets Held for Sale
Assets and liabilities to be disposed of that meet all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of
their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell. We recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million relating to assets held for
sale for the year ended December 31, 2020. Assets are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified as held for sale. For
further information on our assets held for sale, see Note 5.
Asset Retirement Costs and Asset Retirement Obligations
Our asset retirement obligations are primarily related to our IBX data centers, of which the majority are leased under long-term
arrangements and are required to be returned to the landlords in their original condition. The majority of our IBX data center leases
have been subject to significant development by us in order to convert them from, in most cases, vacant buildings or warehouses
into IBX data centers. The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred.
The associated retirement costs are capitalized and included as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset and amortized
over the useful life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement, we accrete the liability in relation to the asset retirement
obligations over time and the accretion expense is recorded as a cost of revenue. For further information on our asset retirement
obligations, see Note 7.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We have three reportable segments comprised of the 1) Americas, 2) EMEA and 3) Asia-Pacific geographic regions, which we
also determined are our reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or more often if and
when circumstances indicate that goodwill is not recoverable.
We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying value. Qualitative factors considered in the assessment include industry and market conditions, overall financial
performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, we
determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing a
quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform a quantitative
goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test, which is used to identify both the existence of impairment and the
amount of impairment loss, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value
of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is
recognized as an impairment loss.
As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we concluded that it was more likely than not that goodwill attributed to our
Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units was not impaired as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying
value of its respective reporting unit, including goodwill.
Substantially all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated period of benefit. We perform a review of intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in
circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We did not
record any impairment charges related to our other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
For further information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 3 and Note 7 below.

Debt Issuance Costs
Costs and fees incurred upon debt issuances are capitalized and are amortized over the life of the related debt based on the
effective interest method. Such amortization is included as a component of interest expense. Debt issuance costs related to
outstanding debt are presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt obligation and debt issuance costs related to the
revolving credit facility are presented as other assets. For further information on debt facilities, see Note 11 below.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
We utilize foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy. Foreign currency
derivatives help to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on (i) our expected revenues and expenses in the
EMEA region, (ii) investments in our foreign operations and (iii) certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. Interest rate derivatives, on the other hand, are used to manage the interest rate risk associated with anticipated fixed-
rate debt issuances.
These measures allow us to effectively control our financial exposure and are not used for speculative purposes. We
recognize all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the value of a derivative
depends on whether the contract qualifies and has been designated for hedge accounting. In order to qualify for hedge accounting,
a derivative must be considered highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and there must be
documentation of the risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item
and the risk exposure, and the effectiveness assessment methodology. Hedge designations are reviewed on a quarterly basis to
assess whether circumstances have changed that would disrupt the hedge instrument's relationship to the forecasted transactions
or net investment.
Cash Flow Hedges
The instruments we designate as cash flow hedges include foreign currency forwards and options, cross-currency swaps as
well as interest rate locks. For cash flow hedges, we use a regression analysis at the time they are designated to assess their
effectiveness.
We use foreign currency forwards and options to hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure for forecasted revenues and
expenses in our EMEA region between the U.S. Dollar and the British Pound, Euro, Swedish Krona, and Swiss Franc. We use the
forward method to assess effectiveness of qualifying foreign currency forwards that are designated as cash flow hedges, whereby,
the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the same line
item in the consolidated statement of operations that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged
item affects earnings. We use the spot method to assess effectiveness of qualifying foreign currency exchange options that are
designated as cash flow hedges, whereby, the change in fair value due to foreign currency exchange spot rates is recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations that is used to
present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings, and the change in fair value of the excluded
component is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized on a straight-line basis to the same line item in the
consolidated statement of operations that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. When two or more derivative
instruments in combination are jointly designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, as with foreign currency exchange option
collars, they are treated as a single instrument. If the hedge relationship is terminated for any derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges, then the change in fair value of the derivative recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings
when the previously hedged item affects earnings, consistent with the original hedge strategy.
We also utilize cross-currency interest rate swaps, which we designate as cash flow hedges, to manage the foreign currency
exposure associated with a portion of our foreign currency-denominated debt. We assess the effectiveness of cross-currency
interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges using the spot method. The fair value changes are recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss), and when the hedged item impacts earnings, the change in fair value due to foreign currency
exchange spot rates is reclassified to the corresponding line item in the consolidated statement of operations.
We use interest rate derivative instruments such as treasury locks and swap locks, collectively referred to as "interest rate
locks", to manage interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed rate debt issuances. An interest
F-14
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
rate lock is a synthetic forward sale of a benchmark interest rate, which is settled in cash based upon the difference between an
agreed upon rate at inception and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. It effectively fixes the benchmark rate component of
an upcoming debt issuance. The interest rate lock transactions are designated as cash flow hedges, with all changes in value
reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Subsequent to settlement, amounts in other comprehensive income are amortized
to interest expense over the term of the interest rate locks.
For hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the
original strategy, any related derivative amounts recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) are immediately recognized in
earnings.
Net Investment Hedges
We employ cross-currency swaps, which we designate as net investment hedges, to hedge the currency exposure associated
with our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. We use the spot method to assess effectiveness of cross-currency interest rate
swaps that are designated as net investment hedges, whereby, the change in fair value due to foreign currency exchange spot
rates is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and the change in fair value of the excluded component is recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss) and amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis.
Occasionally, we also use foreign exchange forward contracts, which we designate as net investment hedges, to hedge against
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in the foreign subsidiaries. We use the spot
method to assess effectiveness of qualifying foreign currency forwards that are designated as net investment hedges, whereby, the
change in fair value due to foreign currency exchange spot rates is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and the change
in fair value of the excluded component is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized to interest expense on a
straight-line basis.
Non-designated Hedges
Foreign currency gains or losses associated with derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting
purposes are recorded within other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of (i) foreign
currency embedded derivatives contained in certain of our customer contracts and (ii) foreign exchange forward contracts that are
entered into to hedge the accounting impact of the foreign currency embedded derivatives, which are recorded within revenues in
our consolidated statements of operations. For further information on derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 8 below.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments represent their fair
value, while our accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued property, plant and equipment
approximate their fair value due primarily to the short-term maturity of the related instruments. The fair value of our debt, which is
traded in the public debt market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our debt, which is not publicly traded, is
estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and terms of the
debt.
Fair Value Measurements
We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including our investments in
money market funds, certificates of deposit, publicly traded equity securities and derivatives.
We also follow the accounting standard for the measurement of fair value for non-financial assets and liabilities on a
nonrecurring basis. These include:
•Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new
basis event, but not measured at fair value in subsequent reporting periods;
•Reporting units and non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities measured at fair value for goodwill impairment tests;
•Indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments;
F-15
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
•Non-financial long-lived assets or asset groups measured at fair value for impairment assessments or disposal;
•Asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value but not subsequently measured at fair value; and
•Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell and reported at the lower of the
carrying amounts or the fair values less costs to sell.
For further information on fair value measurements, see Note 5 and Note 9 below.
Leases
We enter into lease arrangements primarily for land, data center spaces, office spaces and equipment. At its inception, we
determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease. We recognize a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and lease liability on the
consolidated balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months, including renewals options that we are reasonably
certain to exercise.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make
lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are classified and recognized at the commencement date. When
there is a lease modification, including a change in lease term, we reassess its classification and remeasure the ROU asset and
lease liability.
ROU lease liabilities are measured based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets
consist of (i) initial measurement of the lease liability; (ii) lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date
less any lease incentives received; and (iii) initial direct costs incurred by us. Lease payments may vary because of changes in
facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement, including changes in inflation indices. Variable lease payments that
depend on an index or a rate (such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest rate) are included in the measurement of
ROU assets and lease liabilities using the index or rate at the commencement date. Subsequent changes to lease payments based
on changes to the index and rate are accounted for as variable lease payments and recognized in the period they are incurred.
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are excluded from the measurement of ROU assets and lease
liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Since most of our leases do not
provide an implicit rate, we use our own incremental borrowing rate ("IBR") on a collateralized basis in determining the present
value of lease payments. We utilize a market-based approach to estimate the IBR. The approach requires significant judgment.
Therefore, we utilize different data sets to estimate IBRs via an analysis of (i) sovereign rates; (ii) yields on our outstanding public
debt; and (iii) indicative pricing on both secured and unsecured debt received from banking partners. We also apply adjustments to
account for considerations related to (i) tenor; and (ii) country credit rating that may not be fully incorporated by the aforementioned
data sets.
The majority of our lease arrangements include options to extend the lease. If we are reasonably certain to exercise such
options, the periods covered by the options are included in the lease term. The depreciable lives of certain fixed assets and
leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term. We have certain leases with a term of 12 months or less. For such
leases, we elected not to recognize any ROU asset or lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet. We have lease agreements
with lease and non-lease components. We elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease
component for all classes of underlying assets for which we have identified as lease arrangements. For further information on
leases, see Note 10 below.
Revenue
Revenue Recognition
Equinix derives more than 90% of its revenues from recurring revenue streams, consisting primarily of (1) colocation, which
includes the licensing of cabinet space and power; (2) interconnection offerings; (3) managed infrastructure solutions and (4) other
revenues consisting of rental income from tenants or subtenants. The remainder of our revenues are from non-recurring revenue
streams, such as installation revenues, professional services, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues by service lines
and geographic areas are included in segment information. For further information on segment information, see Note 17 below.
Revenues are recognized when control of these products and services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that
reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products and services. Revenues from recurring revenue
streams are generally billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the
F-16
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
contract, generally 1 to 3 years for IBX data center colocation customers. Non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid
upfront upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term. Professional service fees and equipment
sales are recognized in the period when the services were provided. For the contracts with customers that contain multiple
performance obligations, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct or as a series of distinct
obligations if the individual performance obligations meet the series criteria. Determining whether products and services are
considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant
judgment. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The
standalone selling price is determined based on overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions, geographic
locations and other factors. Other judgments include determining if any variable consideration should be included in the total
contract value of the arrangement such as price increases.
Revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent, as we are primarily
responsible for fulfilling the contract, bear inventory risk and have discretion in establishing the price when selling to the customer.
To the extent we do not meet the criteria for recognizing revenue on a gross basis, we record the revenue on a net basis. Revenue
from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is treated as a contract modification and
recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any.
We guarantee certain service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. If these service levels are not
achieved due to any failure of the physical infrastructure or offerings, or in the event of certain instances of damage to customer
infrastructure within our IBX data centers, we would reduce revenue for any credits or cash payments given to the customer.
Historically, these credits and cash payments have not been significant.
We enter into revenue contracts with customers for data centers and office spaces, which contain both lease and non-lease
components. We elected to adopt the practical expedient which allows lessors to combine lease and non-lease components, by
underlying class of asset, and account for them as one component if they have the same timing and pattern of transfer. The
combined component is accounted for in accordance with the current lease accounting guidance ("Topic 842") if the lease
component is predominant, and in accordance with Topic 606 if the non-lease component is predominant. In general, customer
contracts for data centers are accounted for under Topic 606 and customer contracts for the use of office space are accounted for
under Topic 842, which are generally classified as operating leases and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Certain customer agreements are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the parties involved. Under
applicable accounting rules, we are deemed to have foreign currency forward contracts embedded in these contracts. We
assessed these embedded contracts and concluded them to be foreign currency embedded derivatives (see Note 8). These
instruments are separated from their host contracts and held on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. The majority of
these foreign currency embedded derivatives arise in certain of our subsidiaries where the local currency is the subsidiary's
functional currency and the customer contract is denominated in the U.S. dollar. Changes in their fair values are recognized within
revenues in our consolidated statements of operations.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections result in accounts receivables, contract assets and deferred
revenues. A receivable is recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for credit losses and is recognized in the period
when we have transferred products or provided services to our customers and when its right to consideration is unconditional.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 45
days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our
contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. We assess collectability based on a number of factors,
including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We generally do not request
collateral from our customers although in certain cases we obtain a security interest in a customer's equipment placed in our IBX
data centers or obtain a deposit. We also maintain an allowance for estimated losses on a lifetime loss basis resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments for which we had expected to collect the revenues in accordance with the
credit loss guidance accounting guidance ("Topic 326"). If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they
became insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, greater allowances for credit losses may be
required. Management specifically analyzes current
F-17
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
economic news, conditions and trends, historical loss rates, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, changes in
customer payment terms and any applicable long term forecast when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our
reserves for our accounts receivable. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be
uncollectable are charged to bad debt expense included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of
operations. A specific bad debt reserve of up to the full amount of a particular invoice value is provided for certain problematic
customer balances. An additional reserve is established for all other accounts based on an analysis of historical credits issued.
Delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable.
A contract asset exists when we have transferred products or provided services to our customers but customer payment is
conditioned on reasons other than the passage of time, such as upon the satisfaction of additional performance obligations. Certain
contracts include terms related to price arrangements such as price increases and free months. We recognize revenues ratably
over the contract term, which could potentially give rise to contract assets during certain periods of the contract term. Contract
assets are recorded in other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred revenue (a contract liability) is recognized when we have an unconditional right to a payment before we transfer the
products or services to customers. Deferred revenue is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, in the
consolidated balance sheet.
Contract Costs
Direct and indirect incremental costs solely related to obtaining revenue contracts are capitalized as costs of obtaining a
contract, when they are incremental and if they are expected to be recovered. Such costs consist primarily of commission fees and
sales bonuses, as well as indirect related payroll costs. In 2022, contract costs were amortized over the estimated period of 5.5
years on a straight-line basis. We elected to apply the practical expedient which allows us to expense contract costs when incurred,
if the amortization period is one year or less.
For further information on revenue recognition, see Note 2 below.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences that exist between the financial statement carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as tax attributes such as operating loss, capital loss and tax
credits carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are
expected more likely than not to be realized in the future. A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in
the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and
consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. Recognized income tax
positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized. Any subsequent
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As a result, we
may deduct the dividends made to our stockholders from taxable income generated by us and that of our qualified REIT
subsidiaries ("QRSs"). Our dividends paid deduction generally eliminates the U.S. federal taxable income of our REIT and QRSs,
resulting in no U.S. federal income tax due. However, our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") are subject to the U.S.
corporate income taxes on any taxable income generated by them. In addition, our foreign operations are subject to local income
taxes regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs.
Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution,
stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy quarterly asset tests depends upon our
analysis and the fair market values of our REIT and non-REIT assets. For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate
the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a
F-18
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on
industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market
value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins, and projected capital
expenditures. We revisit significant assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment.
For further information on income taxes, see Note 14 below.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors
based on the fair value of the award. We generally recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. However, for awards with market conditions or
performance conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
for each vesting tranche of the award. We elected to estimate forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. 
We grant restricted stock units ("RSUs") or restricted stock awards ("RSAs") to our employees and these equity awards
generally have only a service condition. We grant RSUs to our executives that generally have a service and performance condition
or a service and market condition. Performance conditions contained in an equity award are generally tied to our financial
performance. We assess the probability of meeting these performance conditions on a quarterly basis. The majority of our RSUs
vest over four years, although certain equity awards for executives vest over a range of two to four years. Our RSAs vest over
three years. The valuation of RSUs and RSAs with only a service condition or a service and performance condition requires no
significant assumptions as the fair value for these types of equity awards is based solely on the fair value of our stock price on the
date of grant. We use a Monte Carlo simulation option-pricing model to determine the fair value of RSUs with a service and market
condition.
We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"). The
determination of the fair value of shares purchased under the ESPP is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and
subjective variables including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee
stock purchase behaviors. We estimated the expected volatility by using the average historical volatility of its common stock that it
believed was best representative of future volatility. The risk-free interest rate used was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the equity awards. The expected dividend rate used was based on
average dividend yields and the expected term used was equal to the term of each purchase window.
The accounting standard for stock-based compensation does not allow the recognition of unrealized tax benefits associated
with the tax deductions in excess of the compensation recorded (excess tax benefit) until the excess tax benefit is realized (i.e.,
reduces taxes payable). We record the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as income tax expense through the
statement of operations. For further information on stock-based compensation, see Note 13 below.
Foreign Currency Translation
The financial position of foreign subsidiaries is translated using the exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, while
income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses from translation of foreign
operations where the local currency is the functional currency are included as other comprehensive income (loss). The net gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in net income in the period incurred and recorded within other
income (expense). Certain inter-company balances are designated as loans of a long-term investment-type nature. Accordingly,
exchange gains and losses associated with these long-term inter-company balances are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss), along with translation adjustments.
Earnings Per Share
We compute basic and diluted EPS for net income. Basic EPS is computed using net income and the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using net income and the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding plus any dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive
F-19
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
potential common shares include the assumed exercise, vesting and issuance activity of employee equity awards using the
treasury stock method. For further information on earnings per share, see Note 4 below.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a higher price than its cost, the
difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital to the extent that there are gains to offset the losses. If there are
no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in capital, the losses are recorded as a component of retained earnings.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-
04, "Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations". This guidance
requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods
and services. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted, except for the
amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We do not expect the
adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Standards Recently Adopted
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ("Topic 326"): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting
date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The ASU requires enhanced
qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates
and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's
portfolio. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019,
with early adoption permitted. We adopted this new ASU on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach and
recorded a net decrease to retained earnings of $0.9 million and a corresponding increase to allowance for credit losses. The
adoption did not have a significant impact on other financial assets within the scope of Topic 326, such as contract assets.
Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform ("Topic 848"): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
Reform on Financial Reporting. In addition, FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform ("Topic 848"), which clarifies the
scope of Topic 848. Collectively, the guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts,
hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2021-01 is effective
upon issuance and ASU 2020-04 was effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, and together remained effective through
December 31, 2022. In December 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform ("Topic 848"): Deferral of the Sunset
Date of Topic 848. Because the current relief in Topic 848 may not cover a period of time during which a significant number of
modifications may take place, the amendments in this Update defer the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to
December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. We adopted these ASUs upon
their respective issuances and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting the guidance.
We will evaluate our debt, derivative and lease contracts that may become eligible for modification relief and may apply the
elections prospectively as needed.
Income Taxes
In December 2019, FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes ("Topic 740"): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.  The
ASU simplifies accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The ASU also
improves consistent application of and simplifies generally accepted
F-20

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
accounting principles ("GAAP") for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The ASU is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted
including adoption in any interim period for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. On January 1, 2021,
we adopted this ASU on a prospective basis and the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
Debt with Conversion and Other Options
In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06: Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by
reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and modifies the
disclosure requirement for the convertible instruments. Additionally, this ASU improves the consistency of EPS calculations by
eliminating the use of the treasury stock method to calculate diluted EPS for convertible instruments and clarifies certain areas
under the current EPS guidance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted at the beginning of the fiscal year after December 15, 2020. On January 1, 2022,
we adopted this ASU on a prospective basis and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
Business Combinations
In October 2021, FASB issued ASU 2021-08 Business Combinations ("Topic 805"): Accounting for Contract Assets and
Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The ASU requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business
combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets
and liabilities were recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. On April 1, 2022, we early
adopted this ASU and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The net change in our allowance for credit losses was insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2022.
The difference between the opening and closing balances of our accounts receivable, net, contract assets and deferred
revenues primarily results from revenue growth and the timing difference between the satisfaction of our performance obligation
and the customer's payment, as well as business combinations closed during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The
amounts of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 from the opening deferred revenue
balance were $82.8 million, $93.1 million and $87.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
no impairment loss related to contract balances was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
Contract Costs
The ending balances of net capitalized contract costs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $371.3 million and $325.5
million, respectively, which were included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. $96.0 million, $87.6 million, and $85.4
million of contract costs were amortized during years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which were
included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
Remaining performance obligations
As of December 31, 2022, approximately $10.1 billion of total revenues, including deferred installation revenues, are expected
to be recognized in future periods. Most of our revenue contracts have an initial term varying from one to three years, and
thereafter, automatically renew in one-year increments. Included in the remaining performance obligations are contracts that are
either under the initial term or under one-year renewal periods. We expect to recognize approximately 70% of our remaining
performance obligations as revenues over the next two years, with more revenues expected to be recognized in the first year due
to the impact of contracts renewal. The remainder of the balance is generally expected to be recognized over the next three to five
years. We estimate our remaining performance obligations at a point in time. Actual amounts and timing of revenue recognition
may differ from these estimates due to changes in actual deployments dates, contract modifications, renewals and/or terminations.
The remaining performance obligations do not include variable consideration related to unsatisfied performance obligations
such as the usage of metered power, service fees from xScale data centers, which are calculated based on future events or
actual costs incurred in the future, or any contracts that could be terminated without any significant penalties such as the majority of
interconnection revenues. The remaining performance obligations above include revenues to be recognized in the future related to
arrangements where we are considered the lessor.(1)

3.    Acquisitions
2022 Acquisitions
Acquisition of Entel Chile Data Centers (the "Entel Chile Acquisition") and Entel Peru Data Center (the "Entel Peru Acquisition")
On May 2, 2022, we further expanded in Latin America through an acquisition of four data centers in Chile from Entel, a leading
Chilean telecommunications provider, for a total purchase consideration of $638.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on that
date. On August 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a data center in Peru from Entel for a total purchase consideration of
$80.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. The Entel Chile Acquisition and Entel Peru Acquisition support our ongoing
expansion to meet customer demand in the Latin American market.
Acquisition of MainOne (the "MainOne Acquisition")
On April 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of MainOne, consisting of four data centers as well as
a subsea cable and terrestrial fiber network. We acquired MainOne and its assets for a total purchase consideration of
$278.4 million. The MainOne Acquisition supports our ongoing expansion to meet customer demand in the West African market.
2021 Acquisition
Acquisition of GPX India (the "GPX India Acquisition")
On September 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of GPX India, representing two data centers in Mumbai, India, for a total
purchase consideration of approximately INR12.5 billion, or $170.5 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. The GPX
India Acquisition supports our ongoing expansion to meet customer demand in the Indian market.
Purchase price allocation
Each of the acquisitions noted above constitute a business under the accounting standard for business combinations and,
therefore, were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the total
purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value on the date of acquisition, except
where alternative measurement is required under GAAP.
As of December 31, 2022, we had not completed the detailed valuation analysis to derive the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from the Entel Peru Acquisition, Entel Chile Acquisition and MainOne Acquisition as it relates to the related tax
impacts; therefore, the purchase price allocation is based on provisional estimates and subject to continuing management analysis.

$95.4 million of deferred revenue - non-current.
Property, plant and equipment - The fair values of property, plant and equipment acquired from these four acquisitions were
estimated by applying the cost approach, with the exception of land, which we estimated by applying the market approach. The key
assumptions of the cost approach include replacement cost new, physical deterioration, functional and economic obsolescence,
economic useful life, remaining useful life, age and effective age.

The fair value was estimated by calculating the present value of estimated future operating cash flows generated from
existing customers less costs to realize the revenue and/or by using benchmarking. The rates reflect the nature of the assets
as they relate to the risk and uncertainty of the estimated future operating cash flows, as well as the risk of the country within
which the acquired business operates.
The fair value of the MainOne trade name was estimated using the relief from royalty method under the income approach.
We applied a relief from royalty rate of 1.0%.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Goodwill is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the projected revenue increase expected
to arise from future customers after the acquisition. Goodwill from the GPX India Acquisition is attributable to the Asia-Pacific region
and is not deductible for local tax purposes. Goodwill from the Entel Peru and Entel Chile acquisitions are attributable to the
Americas region and are not expected to be amortizable for local tax purposes. Goodwill from the MainOne Acquisition is
attributable to the EMEA region and is generally not deductible for local tax purposes.
Revenues and net income from operations
The operating results of the Entel Peru and Entel Chile acquisitions are reported in the Americas region and the operating
results of the MainOne Acquisition are reported in the EMEA region following the date of acquisition. During the year ended
December 31, 2022, our results of operations from these acquisitions included $89.9 million of revenues and $8.2 million net
income from operations.
Transaction costs
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the transaction costs for the Entel Chile and Entel Peru acquisitions were
$7.2 million and the transaction costs for the MainOne acquisition were not significant.
2020 Acquisitions
Acquisition of Bell Data Centers (the "Bell Acquisition")
On October 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of 12 data center sites across Canada from Bell, with one additional data
center in Ottawa Canada acquired on November 2, 2020, for a total combined purchase consideration of approximately
C$934.3 million, or $704.0 million at the exchange rates in effect on those dates. The acquisition supports our ongoing expansion
to meet customer demand in Canada.
Acquisition of Packet (the "Packet Acquisition")
On March 2, 2020, we acquired all outstanding shares and equity awards of Packet, a leading bare metal automation platform
for a total purchase consideration of approximately $290.3 million in cash. In addition, we paid $16.1 million in cash to accelerate
the vesting of unvested Packet equity awards for certain Packet employees, which was recorded as stock-based compensation
expense during the three months ended March 31, 2020. In connection with the acquisition, we also issued restricted stock awards
with an aggregated fair value of $30.2 million and a three-year vesting period, which will be recognized as stock-based
compensation costs over the vesting period. The acquisition, combined with Equinix Metal, is expected to accelerate our strategy
to help enterprises deploy hybrid multicloud architectures on our data center platform.
Acquisition of data centers from Axtel (the "Axtel Acquisition")
On January 8, 2020, we completed the acquisition of three data centers in Mexico from Axtel for a total purchase consideration
of approximately $189.0 million, including $175.0 million in cash and $14.0 million we paid to the seller for recoverable value-added
taxes ("VAT") incurred prior to the acquisition, which related to a corresponding VAT receivable acquired upon acquisition. The
acquisition supports our ongoing expansion to meet customer demand in our Americas region.(1)

In June 2021, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with GIC Private
Limited, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund ("GIC"), to develop and operate additional xScale data centers in Europe and the
Americas (the “EMEA 2 Joint Venture”). xScale data centers are engineered to meet the technical and operational requirements
and price points of core hyperscale workload deployments and also offer access to our comprehensive suite of interconnection and
edge solutions. The transaction was structured to close in phases over the course of two years, pending regulatory approval and
other closing conditions. The assets and liabilities of the Warsaw 4 ("WA4") data center site, which were included within our EMEA
region, were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2021. In June 2022, we sold the WA4 data center in exchange for a total
consideration of $61.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an insignificant gain on the sale of the
WA4 data center.
In October 2021, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with PGIM
Real Estate ("PGIM"), to develop and operate xScale data centers in Asia-Pacific (the "Asia-Pacific 2 Joint Venture"). The assets
and liabilities of the Sydney 9 ("SY9") data center site, which were included within our Asia-Pacific region, were classified as held
for sale as of September 30, 2021. Upon closing the joint venture in March 2022, we sold the SY9 data center in exchange for a
total consideration of $201.3 million, which was comprised of $165.6 million of net cash proceeds, a 20% partnership interest in the
Asia-Pacific 2 Joint Venture with a fair value of $29.8 million, and $5.9 million of receivables. During the year ended December 31,
2022, we recognized an insignificant loss on the sale of the SY9 data center.
In March 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico 3 ("MX3") data center site in connection with the formation of a
new joint venture with GIC (the "AMER 1 Joint Venture") to develop and operate xScale data centers in the Americas. Given that
the key terms of the sale had been substantially agreed upon as of September 30, 2021, the assets and liabilities of the MX3 data
center, which are currently included within our Americas region, were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2021 and
remained held for sale as of December 31, 2022.TM

Sale of xScale data center facilities in 2021
As noted above, in June 2021, we entered into an agreement to form the EMEA 2 Joint Venture with GIC. The assets and
liabilities of the data center sites that were expected to be sold to the EMEA 2 Joint Venture within a year were classified as held for
sale as of June 30, 2021. The first phase of the transaction, comprised of data center sites located in Frankfurt, Helsinki, Madrid,
Milan and Paris, closed in September 2021. Upon closing, we sold these data center sites in exchange for a total consideration of
$144.0 million, which was comprised of $106.4 million of net cash proceeds, a 20% partnership interest in the EMEA 2 Joint
Venture with a fair value of $30.4 million, and $7.2 million of receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we
recognized an insignificant gain on the sale of these xScale data center facilities. In October 2021, we completed the sale of the
Sao Paulo 5 ("SP5") data center to the EMEA 2 Joint Venture in exchange for a total consideration of $34.3 million. During the year
ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an insignificant loss on the sale of the SP5 data center.
In May 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the Dublin 5 ("DB5") data center site to the EMEA 1 Joint Venture (as
defined in Note 6 below). The assets and liabilities of the DB5 data center, which were included within our EMEA region, were
classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2021. In July 2021, we sold the DB5 data center in exchange for a total consideration of
$77.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a total gain of $15.8 million on the sale of the DB5 data
center. (1)

6.    Equity Method Investments
We hold various equity method investments, primarily joint venture or partnership arrangements, in order to invest in certain
entities that are in line with our business development objectives, including the development and operation of xScale data centers.
Some of these xScale joint ventures are classified as VIEs, as discussed further below. The Asia-Pacific 1, Asia-Pacific 2, Asia-
Pacific 3 and EMEA 2 Joint Ventures (the "VIE Joint Ventures") share a similar purpose, design and nature of assets. The following

Non - VIE Joint Venture
EMEA 1 Joint Venture
In 2019, we entered into a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with GIC (the "EMEA 1 Joint Venture"), to
develop and operate xScale data centers in Europe. The EMEA 1 Joint Venture is not a VIE given that both equity investors'
interests have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest and it is sufficiently capitalized to sustain its operations, requiring
additional funding from its partners only when expanding operations. Our share of income and losses of equity method investments
from this joint venture was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and was included in other income
(expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.
We committed to make future equity contributions to the EMEA 1 Joint Venture for funding its future development. As of
December 31, 2022, we had future equity contribution commitments of $11.3 million.
VIE Joint Ventures
In 2020, we entered into a second joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with GIC (the "Asia-Pacific 1 Joint
Venture") to develop and operate xScale data centers in Asia-Pacific.
In 2021, we entered into the EMEA 2 Joint Venture with GIC to develop and operate additional xScale data centers in
Europe and the Americas (see Note 5 above).
On March 11, 2022, we entered into the Asia-Pacific 2 Joint Venture with PGIM to develop and operate additional xScale data
centers in Asia-Pacific (see Note 5 above).
On April 6, 2022, we entered into a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with GIC (the "Asia-Pacific 3 Joint
Venture") to develop and operate additional xScale data centers in Seoul, Korea. Upon closing, we contributed $17.0 million in
exchange for a 20% partnership interest in the joint venture.
The VIE Joint Ventures are considered VIEs because they do not have sufficient funds from operations to be self-sustaining.
While we provide certain management services to their operations and earn fees for the performance of such services, the power
to direct the activities of these joint ventures that most significantly impact economic performance is shared equally between us and
either GIC or PGIM, as applicable. These activities include data center construction and operations, sales and marketing, financing,
and real estate purchases or sales. Decisions about these activities require the consent of both Equinix and either GIC or PGIM, as
applicable. We concluded that neither party is deemed to have predominant control over the VIE Joint Ventures and neither party is
considered to be the primary beneficiary. Our share of income of equity method investments from these joint ventures was
$8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2021 and was
included in other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.

8.    Derivatives and Hedging Instruments
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
Net Investment Hedges. We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the value of investments in our
foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. Dollar. In order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency
exchange rates, we have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations, which are designated as hedges against our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total principal amounts of foreign currency debt
obligations designated as net investment hedges was $1.5 billion.
We also utilize cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as net investment hedges, which effectively convert a portion of
our U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt to foreign currency-denominated fixed-rate debt, to hedge the currency exposure
associated with our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31,(1)

Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as net investment hedges, were $3.9
billion and $4.0 billion respectively, with maturity dates ranging through 2026.
From time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges, to hedge
against the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the total notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges were $373.4 million
and $375.7 million, respectively.
Certain of our customer agreements that are priced in currencies different from the functional or local currencies of the parties
involved are deemed to have foreign currency forward contracts embedded in them. These embedded derivatives are separated
from their host contracts and carried on our balance sheet at their fair value. The majority of these embedded derivatives arise as a
result of our foreign subsidiaries pricing their customer contracts in U.S. Dollars. We use these forward contracts embedded within
our customer agreements to hedge against the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our net investment in our foreign
subsidiaries.
The effect of net investment hedges on accumulated other comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands):

Cash Flow Hedges. We hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure for forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA
region between the U.S. Dollar and the British Pound, Euro, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The foreign currency forward and
option contracts that we use to hedge this exposure are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts were $490.8 million and $831.2 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, our foreign currency cash flow hedge instruments had maturity dates ranging from January 2023 to
February 2024 and we had a net gain of $8.2 million recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be
reclassified to revenues and expenses relating to these cash flow hedges as they mature in the next 12 months. As of
December 31, 2021, our foreign currency cash flow hedge instruments had maturity dates ranging from January 2022 to December
2023 and we had a net gain of $13.3 million recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be reclassified to
revenues and expenses relating to these cash flow hedges as they mature in the next 12 months.(1)

We enter into intercompany hedging instruments ("intercompany derivatives") with our wholly-owned subsidiaries in order to
hedge certain forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Simultaneously, we enter
into derivative contracts with unrelated third parties to externally hedge the net exposure created by such intercompany derivatives.
We hedge the interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed rate debt issuances through the use of treasury locks and
swap locks (collectively, interest rate locks), which are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2022, we had no
interest rate locks outstanding. As of December 31, 2021, the total notional amount of interest rate locks outstanding was
$800.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, interest rate locks with a combined aggregate notional amount of
$800.0 million were settled related to the issuance of senior notes during the year. When interest rate locks are settled, any gain or
loss from the transactions is deferred and included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized to
interest expense over the term of the forecasted hedged transaction which is equivalent to the term of the interest rate locks. As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a net gain of $1.4 million and a net loss of $3.9 million, respectively, recorded within
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be reclassified to interest expense in the next 12 months for interest rate locks.
We also use cross-currency swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges, to manage the foreign currency exposure
associated with a portion of our foreign currency-denominated debt. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount
of cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, were $280.3 million and $0, respectively.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
Embedded Derivatives. As described above, certain of our customer agreements that are priced in currencies different from the
functional or local currencies of the parties involved are deemed to have foreign currency forward contracts embedded in them.. 
Economic Hedges of Embedded Derivatives. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk
associated with our customer agreements that are priced in currencies different from the functional or local currencies of the parties
involved ("economic hedges of embedded derivatives"). Foreign currency forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the
currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk
associated with certain foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations,
the U.S. Dollar equivalent values of our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities change. Gains and losses on
these contracts are included in other income (expense), on a net basis, along with the foreign currency gains and losses of the
related foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amounts of these foreign currency contracts were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion,
respectively.

Offsetting Derivative Assets and Liabilities
We enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties for transactions other than embedded derivatives to mitigate
credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. Master netting agreements allow for individual derivative contracts with a single
counterparty to offset in the event of default. For presentation on the consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value
amounts recognized for derivative instruments or the accrued interest related to cross-currency interest rate swaps under master
netting arrangements. The following table presents information related to these offsetting arrangements as of December 31, 2022

9.     Fair Value Measurements
Valuation Methods
Fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on methods using the market approach valuation
method which uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable
assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques. These techniques involve uncertainties and are affected by the assumptions used
and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash
flows, future expected loss experience and other factors.
Cash Equivalents. The fair value of our investments in money market funds approximates their face value. Such instruments
are included in cash equivalents. Our money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are
valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. The fair value of our other investments, including certificates
of deposit, approximates their face value. The fair value of these investments is priced based on the quoted market price for similar
instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We determine the fair values of our
Level 2 investments by using inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data,
which are obtained from quoted market prices, custody bank, third-party pricing vendors or other sources. We use such pricing
data as the primary input to make its assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio and
has not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such inputs. We are responsible for our consolidated
financial statements and underlying estimates.
We use the specific identification method in computing realized gains and losses. Realized gains and losses from the sale of
investments are included within other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. Our investments in publicly
traded equity securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on publicly traded equity securities are reported within
other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities. Inputs used for valuations of derivatives are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation
techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. The
significant inputs used include spot currency rates and forward points, interest rate curves, and published credit default swap rates
of its foreign exchange trading counterparties and other comparable companies. We have determined that the inputs used to value
its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, therefore the derivatives are categorized as Level 2.
Other than the assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale as described in Note 5 above, we did not have any
nonfinancial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Revolving Facility") and an approximately $1.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency term loan facility (the "2017 Term Loan
Facility"). The credit agreement was subsequently amended to provide an additional senior unsecured term loan in Japanese Yen
for approximately $424.7 million at the exchange rate effective on the transaction date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
On May 17, 2021, we repaid our outstanding term loans in Swedish Krona and Japanese Yen under the 2017 Term Loan
Facility for $285.4 million and $374.5 million in U.S. Dollars, respectively, at the exchange rates in effect on May 17, 2021 using a
portion of the cash proceeds from the 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2031 Notes, and 2052 Notes issuances as described below.
On January 7, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the "2022 Credit Agreement") with a group of lenders for a senior
unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $4.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "2022 Revolving
Facility") and a £500.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the "2022 Term Loan Facility" and, together with the 2022
Revolving Facility, collectively, the "2022 Credit Facilities"). The total debt issuance costs for the 2022 Revolving Facility and 2022
Term Loan Facility are $6.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively. We borrowed the full £500.0 million available under the 2022
Term Loan Facility, or approximately $676.9 million at the exchange rates in effect on that date. On that same day, using a portion
of the proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan Facility, we prepaid in full all of the $549.6 million of indebtedness outstanding under the
2017 Term Loan Facility, at the exchange rates in effect on January 7, 2022 and terminated the 2017 Credit Agreement. In
connection with the repayment and termination, we incurred an insignificant amount of loss on debt extinguishment. The remaining
unamortized debt issuance costs of the 2017 Credit Facilities will continue to be amortized over the contract terms of the 2022
Credit Facilities.
The 2022 Credit Facilities have a maturity date of January 7, 2027. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the
2022 Revolving Facility until the Maturity Date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Facility must be
repaid in full. The term loan made under the 2022 Term Loan Facility has no scheduled principal amortization and must be repaid in
full on the maturity date. The 2022 Revolving Credit Facility provides for extensions of credit in U.S. Dollars as well as certain other
foreign currencies. Borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate based on the daily Secured Overnight
Financing Rate ("SOFR"), term SOFR, an alternative currency daily rate, or an alternative currency term rate plus a spread
adjustment, plus a margin that can vary from 0.555% to 1.200%. Borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility bear interest at a
rate based on the daily Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA"), plus a spread adjustment, plus a margin that can vary from
0.625% to 1.450%. We are also required to pay a quarterly letter of credit fee on the face amount of each letter of credit, which fee
is based on the same margin that applies from time to time to SOFR-indexed borrowings under the revolving credit line. The margin
is dependent on either our consolidated net leverage ratio or our credit ratings. We are also required to pay a quarterly facility fee
ranging from 0.07% to 0.25% per annum. The 2022 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including financial ratio
covenants that are required to be maintained as of each quarter end.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amounts outstanding under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and 2017 Term Loan
Facility, net of debt issuance costs, were $603.0 million and $549.3 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 60 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $84.7 million issued and outstanding under the 2022
Revolving Facility, with approximately $3.9 billion remaining available to borrow under the 2022 Revolving Facility.

12.    Stockholders' Equity
Our authorized share capital is 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which
25,000,000 is designated Series A, 25,000,000 is designated as Series A-1 and 50,000,000 is undesignated. As of December 31,
2022 and 2021, we had no preferred stock issued and outstanding.
Common Stock
In May 2020, we issued and sold 2,587,500 shares of common stock in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement
and a related prospectus and prospectus supplement. We received net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, net of underwriting
discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
In October 2020, we established an "at the market" equity offering program (the "2020 ATM Program"), under which we could,
from time to time, offer and sell shares of our common stock to or through sales agents up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion. In
February 2022, we entered into a forward sale amendment to the 2020 ATM Program, under which we could, from time to time,
offer and sell shares under the equity distribution agreement pursuant to forward sale transactions (the "Equity Forward
Amendment"). In November 2022, we established a successor ATM program, also with substantially the same terms as the Equity
Forward Amendment noted above, under which we may, from time to time, offer and sell on a spot or forward basis up to an
aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock to or through sales agents in "at the market" transactions (the "2022 ATM Program").
The forward sale agreements provide three settlement alternatives to us: physical settlement, cash settlement or net share
settlement. In accordance with ASC 815, the forward sale agreements are classified as equity for balance sheet purposes. During
the first half of the year, we executed five forward sale agreements under the 2020 ATM Program to sell 579,873 shares of our
common stock. On August 3, 2022, we physically settled these forward sale shares for approximately $393.6 million, net of
payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, at an aggregate weighted-average forward sale price of
$678.72 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we executed three additional forward sale agreements to sell 458,459 shares of
our common stock with maturity dates ranging from February 2023 to November 2023. Of this amount, 308,875 shares were
executed under the 2020 ATM Program and the remaining 149,584 shares were executed under the 2022 ATM Program. The
future net settlement value for these forward sale agreements is approximately $301.6 million at an aggregate weighted-average
forward sale price of $657.75 per share.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold an additional 580,833 shares, excluding the forward sale transactions noted
above, for approximately $403.6 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, under the
2020 ATM Program. As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to the unsettled forward sale transactions noted above, no shares
remained available for sale under the 2020 ATM Program. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 637,617 shares for
approximately $497.9 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, under the 2020 ATM
Program. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 415,512 shares for approximately $298.3 million, net of payment of
commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses under the 2018 ATM Program.

We have a defined benefit pension plan covering all employees in two countries where such plans are mandated by law. We do not have
any defined benefit plans in any other countries. The unamortized gain (loss) on defined benef it plans includes gains or losses resulting
from a change in the value of either the projected benefit obligation or the plan assets resulting from a change in an actuarial assumption,
net of amortization.
Changes in foreign currencies can have a significant impact to our consolidated balance sheets (as evidenced above in our
foreign currency translation loss), as well as its consolidated results of operations, as amounts in foreign currencies are generally
translated into more U.S. dollars when the U.S. dollar weakens or less U.S. dollars when the U.S. dollar strengthens. As of
December 31, 2022, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we
operate as compared to December 31, 2021. Because of this, the U.S. dollar had an overall unfavorable impact on our
consolidated financial position because the foreign denominations translated into fewer U.S. dollars as evidenced by an increase in
foreign currency translation loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 as reflected in the above table. The volatility of the U.S.
dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we operate could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods.(1)

Common stock dividends are characterized for federal income tax purposes as nonqualified ordinary dividend, qualified ordinary dividend,
capital gains or return of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not classify any portion of the
distributions as qualified ordinary dividend, capital gains or return of capital.
All nonqualified ordinary dividends are eligible for the 20% deduction generally allowable to non-corporate shareholders under Internal
Revenue Code Section 199A.
In addition, as of December 31, 2022, for dividends and special distributions attributed to the RSUs, we recorded a short-term
dividend payable of $12.3 million and a long-term dividend payable of $10.4 million for the RSUs that have not yet vested. As
of December 31, 2021, for dividends and special distributions attributed to the RSUs, we recorded a short-term dividend payable of
$12.0 million and a long-term dividend payable of $9.7 million for the RSUs that have not yet vested.

Equity Compensation Plans
As of December 31, 2022, our equity compensation plans included:
•2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2004 Purchase Plan"): The 2004 Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
purchase common stock on favorable terms via payroll deductions of up to 15% of the employee's cash compensation,
subject to certain share and statutory dollar limits. Two overlapping offering periods commence during each calendar year,
on each February 15 and August 15 or such other periods or dates as determined by the Compensation Committee from
time to time, and the offering periods last up to 24 months with a purchase date every 6 months. The price of each share
purchased is 85% of the lower of(1) (2)

period or b) the fair value per share of common stock on the purchase date.
•2020 Equity Incentive Plan: In 2020, both our Board of Directors and our stockholders approved the 2020 Equity Plan,
which provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, RSAs, RSUs, other stock-based incentive awards, dividend equivalents, and cash-based incentive
awards. The 2020 Equity Plan's awards may be granted to employees, non-employee members of the Board and
consultants. Equity awards granted under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan generally vest over four years. The maximum
numbers of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Equity Plan is equal to the sum of
4.0 million shares and the shares transferred from the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan.
The Equity compensation plans are administered by the Talent, Culture and Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors (the "Compensation Committee"), and the Compensation Committee may terminate or amend these plans, with approval
of the stockholders as may be required by applicable law, at any time. As of December 31, 2022, shares reserved and available for

acquisition of Metronode in 2018. The uncertain tax position was covered by an indemnification agreement with the Seller. As such,
the realization of the unrecognized tax benefit resulted in an impairment of the indemnification asset for the same amount, which
has been included in Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021.
Our accounting policy is to treat any tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") inclusions as a current period cost
included in the tax expense in the year incurred. We believe the GILTI inclusion provision will result in no material financial
statement impact provided we satisfy our REIT distribution requirement with respect to the GILTI inclusions.
As a result of our conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2015, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed
foreign earnings. However, no deferred tax liability has been recognized to account for this change because the expected recovery
of the basis difference will not result in material U.S. taxes in the post-REIT conversion periods due to the fact that the majority of
our foreign subsidiaries are either QRSs or owned directly by our REIT and QRSs, and the foreign withholding tax effect would be
immaterial. We continue to assess the foreign withholding tax impact of our current policy and do not believe the distribution of our
foreign earnings would trigger any significant foreign withholding taxes, as the majority of the foreign jurisdictions where we operate
do not impose withholding taxes on dividend distributions to a corporate U.S. parent.

Our accounting for deferred taxes involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of our deferred
tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction. After considering evidence such as the nature, frequency and severity of current and
cumulative financial reporting losses, the sources of future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years permitted by the tax
laws and tax planning strategies, we concluded that valuation allowances were required in certain jurisdictions. The operations in
most of the jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance has been established have a history of significant losses as of
December 31, 2022. As such, we do not believe these operations have established a sustained history of profitability and that a
valuation allowance is, therefore, necessary. We also provided a valuation allowance against certain gross deferred tax assets in
certain taxing jurisdictions as these deferred tax assets are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
As of December 31, 2022, we had tax credit carryforwards of $6.2 million, which expire, if not utilized, from 2023 to 2031. We
also had capital losses of $7.2 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
The beginning and ending balances of our unrecognized tax benefits are reconciled below for the years ended December 31
(in thousands):

Decreases resulting from settlements (11,924) (5,089) (3,330)
Ending balance $ 89,237 $ 148,300 $ 207,759 
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense in the consolidated
statements of operations. We accrued $6.5 million, $13.6 million, and $21.3 million for interest and penalties as of December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The unrecognized tax benefits of $89.2 million as of December 31, 2022, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective
tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized.
Due to various tax years open for examination and the ongoing tax audits and inquiries by the tax authorities in different
jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease over
the next 12 months as we may be subject to either examination by tax authorities, tax audit settlements, or a lapse in statute of
limitations. We are currently unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
In general, our income tax returns for the years from 2019 through the current year remain open to examination by federal and
state taxing authorities. In addition, our tax years of 2005 through current year remain open and subject to examination by local tax
authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we have major operations.
15.    Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
As a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2022, we were contractually committed for
approximately $1.6 billion of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX infrastructure equipment not yet delivered and labor
not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to open these IBX data centers and make them available to our customers
for installation. We also had numerous other, non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2022, such as
commitments to purchase power in select locations through 2023 and thereafter, and other open purchase orders for goods, or
services to be delivered or provided during 2023 and thereafter. Such other miscellaneous purchase commitments totaled
approximately $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. For further information on our equity method investments contribution
commitments and lease commitments, see Notes 6 and Note 10, respectively, above.
Contingent Liabilities
We estimate our exposure on certain liabilities, such as indirect and property taxes, based on the best information available at
the time of determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, we record what we can reasonably estimate based on
prior payment history, assessed value by the assessor's office, current landlord estimates or estimates based on current or
changing fixed asset values in each specific municipality, as applicable. However, there are circumstances beyond our control
whereby the underlying value of the property or basis for which the tax is calculated on the property may change, such as a
landlord selling the underlying property of one of our IBX data center leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a
jurisdiction and, as a result, our property tax obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most current facts and
circumstances, we make the necessary property tax accruals for each of our reporting periods. However, revisions
F-55
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
in our estimates of the potential or actual liability could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Our indirect and property tax filings in various jurisdictions are subject to examination by local tax authorities. Although we
believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our potential tax liabilities, and that our tax estimates are reasonable,
there can be no certainty that additional taxes will not be due upon audit of our tax returns or as a result of further changes to the
tax laws and interpretations thereof. For example, we are currently undergoing an audit and appealing the tentative assessment in
Brazil. The final settlement of the audit and the outcomes of the appeal are uncertain and may not be resolved in our favor. We
regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and appeals that would affect the adequacy
of our tax accruals for each of the reporting periods. If any issues arising from the tax examinations and appeals are resolved in a
manner inconsistent with our expectations, the revision of the estimates of the potential or actual liabilities could materially impact
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
From time to time, we may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities.
Contingent liabilities are accrued when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be
reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there are no pending claims for which the outcome is expected to result in a
material adverse effect in the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Employment Agreements
We have entered into a severance agreement with certain of our executive officers that provides for a severance payment
equal to 100% of the executive officer's annual base salary and maximum bonus in the event his or her employment is terminated
for any reason other than cause or he or she voluntarily resigns under certain circumstances as described in the agreement, or
200% of the executive officer's annual base salary and maximum bonus in the event this occurs after a change-in-control of our
company. For certain other executive officers, these benefits are only triggered after a change-in-control of our company, in which
case the officer is entitled to 200% of the executive officer's annual base salary and maximum bonus. In addition, under these
agreements, the executive officer is entitled to the payment of his or her monthly health care premiums under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act for up to 24 months.
Indemnification and Guarantor Arrangements
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is
for the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that could limit our exposure and
enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy that could limit our exposure and
enable us to recover some or all of amounts paid, our estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. We
have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2022.
We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we may
agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party,
generally a business partner or a customer, in connection matters such as any U.S. patent, or any copyright or other intellectual
property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our offerings; a breach of confidentiality obligations and certain other
contractual warranties; our gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of law; and/or if we cause
tangible property damage, personal injury or death. The term of any such indemnification agreement is generally perpetual after
execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related
to these indemnification agreements. As a result, our estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. We do not have
significant liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2022.
We enter into arrangements with certain business partners, whereby the business partner agrees to provide services as a
subcontractor for our installations. Accordingly, we enter into standard indemnification agreements
F-56
Table of Contents
EQUINIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
with our customers, whereby we indemnify them for certain acts, such as personal property damage, by our subcontractors. The
maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited;
however, we have general and umbrella insurance policies that could enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid. We have
never incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, our
estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. We do not have significant liabilities recorded for these agreements as of
December 31, 2022.
We have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant
equipment damage in our IBX data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in obligations to these customers. Our
liability insurance may not be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of service, equipment damage or inability to
meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence our customers have in us, and could consequently
impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our
operating results. We generally have the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue being
recognized. We do not have significant liabilities in connection with service level credits as of December 31, 2022.
Concurrent with the closing of the EMEA 2 Joint Venture, the EMEA 2 Joint Venture entered into credit facility agreements with
a group of lenders under which it could borrow up to approximately $1.4 billion in total at the exchange rate in effect on
December 31, 2022, with such facilities maturing in 2025 and 2026. In connection with our 20% equity investment in the EMEA 2
Joint Venture, we provided the lenders with guarantees covering 20% of all payments of principal and interest due and payable by
the EMEA 2 Joint Venture under these credit facilities, up to a limit of $292.1 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on
December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum potential amount of our future payments under these guarantees was
approximately $89.3 million, at the exchange rates in effect on that date. Our estimated fair value of these guarantees is minimal as
the likelihood of making a payout under the guarantees is low.
16.    Related Party Transactions
Joint Venture Related Party Transactions
We have lease arrangements and provide various services to the EMEA 1 Joint Venture and the VIE Joint Ventures (the "Joint

determined that we have three reportable segments comprised of our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific geographic regions. Our
chief operating decision-maker evaluates performance, makes operating decisions and allocates resources based on our revenues
and adjusted EBITDA performance both on a consolidated basis and based on these three reportable segments. Intercompany
transactions between segments are excluded for management reporting purposes.(1)
