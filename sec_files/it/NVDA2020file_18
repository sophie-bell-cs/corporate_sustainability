PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a
focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence, or AI.
Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its
GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, or VR, high performance computing, or HPC, and AI.
The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today,
it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing
capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This
form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-
driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning continues to be adopted by
thousands of enterprises to deliver services and features that would have been impossible with traditional coding.
NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries,
systems, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets
are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The
programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same
underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and
partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases
the value of our platform to our customers.
Innovation is at our core. We invested over $20 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding
inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer
graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming
model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This
approach significantly accelerates the performance of the most demanding applications in HPC in fields such as
aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs power
many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our
GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While
traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace described by Moore’s Law, we deliver GPU
performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.
Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the
world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality
gaming. A rapidly growing genre of Battle Royale games, such as Fortnite, is also expanding the gaming market.
Researchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics
to weather forecasting. With support for more than over 600 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications -
NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from weather prediction to materials science and
from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. NVIDIA GPUs power the top two supercomputers in the world, located at Oak
Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in
Europe and Japan. In all, NVIDIA powers 136 of the TOP500 supercomputers.
The world’s leading cloud service providers use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to
billions of end-users, including search, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI assistants,
navigation, and cloud computing.
A rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups use our GPUs for deep learning that meets, and in several cases
surpasses, human perception, in fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. For example, the transportation
industry is turning to our GPUs and AI to enable autonomous vehicles, or AVs, with several hundred companies and
organizations working with NVIDIA’s DRIVE platform.
Professional designers use our GPUs to create visual effects in movies and design products ranging from soft drink
bottles to commercial aircraft.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in
Delaware in April 1998.

offerings for NVIDIA GPUs. Our GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce new capabilities for
critical parts of the workflow for such major industries as automotive, media and entertainment, architectural
engineering, oil and gas, and medical imaging.
Designers who build the products we use every day need the images that they view digitally to mirror reality. This
requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering, an emerging trend in
professional design. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a building
with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in greater detail, and generate
photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a
car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.
During fiscal year 2019, we introduced the NVIDIA RTX platform, making it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic
objects and environments with physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time.
Through fiscal year 2020, many leading 3D design and content creation applications developed by our ecosystem
partners enabled support for RTX, allowing professionals to accelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX
GPUs.
Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise
applications, including within medicine, architecture, product design, and retail. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training,
architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs.
Visual computing is vital to productivity in many environments, including design and manufacturing and digital content
creation. Design and manufacturing includes computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products
manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and
post production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics.

Data Center
The NVIDIA accelerated computing platform addresses AI and HPC applications. The platform consists of our energy
efficient GPUs, our CUDA programming language, specific libraries such as cuDNN and TensorRT, and innovations
such as NVLink and NVSwitch interconnects, which enable application scalability across multiple GPUs.
In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads. Deep learning is a
computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in
the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans. Machine learning is a related approach
that leverages algorithms as well as data to learn how to make determinations or predictions, often used in data
science. HPC, also referred to as scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and
complex problems. For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases the
performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and data centers, as GPUs excel at parallel
workloads.
We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such
as reading medical images, to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling.
These organizations include the world’s leading cloud services companies such as Amazon, Baidu, and Facebook,
which are infusing AI in applications that enable highly accurate voice recognition and real-time translation; enterprises
that are increasingly turning to AI to improve products and services; and startups seeking to implement AI in
transformative ways across multiple industries. We partnered with industry leaders such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle,
SAP, and VMware to bring AI to enterprise users. We also have partnerships in healthcare and manufacturing, among
others, to accelerate the adoption of AI.
To enable deep learning and machine learning, we provide a family of GPUs designed to speed up training and
inferencing of neural networks. They are available in industry standard servers from every major computer maker
worldwide, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Inspur, and Lenovo; from every major cloud service provider such as Alicloud,
Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud; as well as in our
DGX AI supercomputer, a purpose-built system for deep learning and GPU accelerated applications. DGX delivers
performance equal to hundreds of conventional servers, comes fully integrated with hardware, software, development
tools, support for AI frameworks, and runs popular accelerated applications. We also offer the NVIDIA GPU Cloud, or
NGC, a comprehensive catalog of easy-to-use, optimized
6
Table of Contents
software stacks across a range of domains including scientific computing, deep learning, and machine learning. With

and deploy them on DGX systems, NGC-ready workstations or servers from our systems partners, or with NVIDIA’s
cloud partners such as Amazon, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Oracle Cloud.
GPUs also increase the speed of applications used in such fields as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and
fluid simulations, and energy exploration. GPUs have significantly impacted scientific discovery, including improving
heart surgery, mapping human genome folds, seismic modeling, and weather simulations.
Accelerated computing is recognized as the path forward for computing amid the slowing of Moore’s Law. The
proportion of supercomputers utilizing accelerators has grown sharply over the past five years, now accounting for a
significant proportion of both the total systems on the TOP500 list, which ranks the 500 most powerful commercially
available computer systems, and the list’s total floating-point operations per second. Tesla GPU accelerators power
many of the world’s fastest supercomputers, including the U.S. Department of Energy’s Summit and Sierra
supercomputers at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, Europe’s fastest supercomputer - Piz
Daint - in Switzerland, Japan’s fastest supercomputer, ABCI; and the world’s fastest industrial supercomputer by Italian
energy company Eni.
We also serve the data center market with GRID for virtualized graphics and Virtual Compute Server for virtualized AI
and data science. GRID makes it possible to run graphics-intensive applications remotely on a server in the data
center. Applications include accelerating virtual desktop infrastructures and delivering graphics-intensive applications
from the cloud for industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and educational institutions, among others. Virtual
Compute Server (vComputeServer) enables data centers to accelerate server virtualization with GPUs so that the most
compute-intensive workloads, such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, and data science, can be run in a virtual
machine.
Automotive
NVIDIA’s Automotive market is comprised of cockpit infotainment solutions, AV platforms, and associated development
agreements. Leveraging our technology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we
are delivering a full solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated multiple applications
of AI within the car. AI can drive the car itself as a pilot, in either partial or fully autonomous mode. AI can also be a co-
pilot, assisting the human driver in creating a safer driving experience.
NVIDIA is working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tier-
one suppliers, sensor manufacturers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to
develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep
neural networks using our GPUs, and then running them within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE computing platform.
The platform consists of high-performance, energy efficient hardware - DRIVE AGX, and open, modular software -
including DRIVE AV for autonomous driving and DRIVE IX for in-vehicle AI assistance. In addition, we offer a scalable
simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, for testing and validating a self-driving platform before commercial
deployment. This end-to-end, software-defined approach allows cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new
features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.
NVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what's happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on
an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor
fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energy-
efficient module for automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling
driverless cars. Our Xavier SoC, which started shipping in 2018, enables vehicles to use deep neural networks to
process data from multiple cameras and sensors. It powers the DRIVE AutoPilot, NVIDIA’s Level 2+ automated driving
solution, combining the DRIVE AV self-driving solution with the DRIVE IX cockpit software, including a visualization
system for allowing the driver to see what the car sees and plans to do. In fiscal year 2020, we announced our next-
generation SoC, Orin, targeting mass production in 2022.
Business Strategies
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the GPU computing platform. The massive parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs can solve
complex problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational
approaches. Indeed, GPUs can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver
continued GPU performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip
design, system, and software layers. Our strategy is to target markets where GPUs deliver order-of-magnitude
performance advantages relative to legacy approaches. Our market platforms so far include Gaming, Professional

the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging
our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to
make leveraged investments in R&D: we can support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying
technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners.
We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end GPU computing
platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, our
CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and system software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will
continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. Our AI technology
leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available
from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are
over 1.6 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our
target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and more than 3,600 startups
through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on

customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers'
requirements and in manufacturing availability. Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and
delivery schedules, thus, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar
amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant.
Seasonality
Our GPU and Tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to
government and cloud service provider data centers, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer
industry. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based
on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks or game consoles typically
generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters.
However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Manufacturing
We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing
strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer
fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are
certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and
assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with
owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the
production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for
procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our
resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.
We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung
Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as
Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.,
Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform
assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd.,
Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron
Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.
We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and
configuration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors,
motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers
assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers,
system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions.
We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and
ODMs such as Quanta Computer and Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to
end customers. In those cases, key elements such as the GPU, SoC and memory are often consigned by us to the
CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.

Working Capital
We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage
inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast
demand on a platform-by-platform basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on
forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products. A substantial amount of our
inventories is maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to
balance our customer demands.
Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 47% to $10.90 billion at the end
of fiscal year 2020 compared with the end of fiscal year 2019.
Competition
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving
industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product
offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry
standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to
remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and
partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of
quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market
entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not
provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge
and acquire significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs,
and other accelerated and AI computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing,
financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or
technological changes.
Our current competitors include:
•suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions,
including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel
Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.;
•large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated
computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc.; and
•suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices,
such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation,
Samsung, and Xilinx, Inc. or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as
Tesla Motors.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our
currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2020 to October 2039. We have numerous patents issued,
allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications
primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international
treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in
which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our
products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection
makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where
to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:
•the location in which our products are manufactured;
•our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
•the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
•the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.
We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.
Employees
As of January 26, 2020, we had 13,775 employees, 9,823 of whom were engaged in research and development and
3,952 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment
involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our
business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you
may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners
If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our
revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.
We created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming,
Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change,
changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards.
Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing)
products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require
considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the
development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the
automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop
the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support. We also must
meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make
considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if
at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we
focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative
products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to
anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately
adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our
business will be harmed.
Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand
their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new
competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer
superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling
prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have
longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent
protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be
able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly
transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain
sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to successfully
compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs
of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products,
services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of
operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to
evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which
could negatively affect our financial results.
System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce
our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage
our reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in
recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them
or
12
Table of Contents
implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected
to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security
controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties.
These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy
viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our
products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality
over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products,
we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks
to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means,
such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal
systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and
reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.
Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved
dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third
parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and
potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to
our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be
successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.
Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales,
lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price
and reputation.
We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products,
which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development,
enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.
We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer
fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using
their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but
instead rely on independent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or
subcontractors. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet
customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results,
including:
•a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices
due to supply constraints;
•a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test
capacity for our products;
•a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including
transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory
designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
•a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
•loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or
subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or
change a supplier;
•a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
•delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our
subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.
In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase
manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross
margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which
is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result
from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our
design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the
manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.
We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new
products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner.
In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of
then available
13
Table of Contents
software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design
requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may
exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the
unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we fail
to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.
For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor.
Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to
anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design
win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in
lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.
Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major
hardware manufacturers and software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry
standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies.
Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as
anticipated, if any.
If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our
reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.
Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory
performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system.
These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications,
including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may
only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product.
Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other
unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could
attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead
to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been
integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such
defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related
inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product
development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related
software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or
loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our
brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or
replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a
significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new
customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability
suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would
divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability
insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely
impact our financial results.
Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages,
outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-
attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic
events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant
losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could
require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters,
and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business
operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults
known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making
our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The
manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated
in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of
our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Geopolitical change or changes in government
regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies,
import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global
markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their
14
Table of Contents
interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or
tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect
on our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an
adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide
us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our operations could be
harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural
disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic,
business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party
foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being
consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or
catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of
declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.
In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and
commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We have
operations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our
customers and suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related
restrictions and closures. The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full
extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business.
If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. We sell
many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end
customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing
market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter
shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods
of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory
to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. Such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell-through,
as we experienced with our mid-range gaming GPUs in fiscal year 2019. In estimating demand, we make multiple
assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
•changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall
economy;
•changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit
market;
•a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
•a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
•less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
•increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could
adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last
month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in
response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost
or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly
forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate
lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers'
orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such
cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a
cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer
relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network
and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these
customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner
network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their
channels. For fiscal year 2020, 11% of our total revenue was from one customer, Dell. Our operating results in the
foreseeable
15
Table of Contents
future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell
products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer
products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing
patterns in some other way, particularly because:
•most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay
product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;
•our partners may develop their own solutions;
•our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or
•our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.
We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade
restrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell
to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our
customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these
customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain
sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit
insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our
business.
We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our
semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the
United States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate
revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’
revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the
United States accounted for 92% of total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and 87% for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 25% of our revenue for fiscal year 2020, even if our
customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Additionally, as of
January 26, 2020, approximately 46% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of
our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations, including:
•international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw
from the European Union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;
•unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
•differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business
practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption
laws and regulations;
•exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs,
quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; 
•disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and
•increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and
pollution limits.
If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may
be negatively impacted.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to
execute our business strategy effectively.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives
and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In
particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is
critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration
or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If
we are less successful
16

in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and
services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of
cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce
practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective
succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and
smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.
We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic
investments, including the Mellanox acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition
targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer
products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic
objectives and business. In March 2019, we announced our agreement to acquire Mellanox for approximately $6.9
billion. The Mellanox acquisition and other past or future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and
risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could
have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to
pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the
prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related
to the Mellanox acquisition, and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
•difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our
business;
•diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
•assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of
acquired assets;
•integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
•coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
•difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
•difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;
•failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
•legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
•uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
•negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target
operate;
•the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
•potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company;
and
•impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of
our acquisition or investment.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete
could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our
products.
We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings
alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have
agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related
litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers,
payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the
IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve
such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such
proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we
could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or
our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have
to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain
licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable
to obtain a license from
17
Table of Contents
a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial
liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also
have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on
commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a
customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating
results.
Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a
combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing
arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States
and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property
rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are
valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property
rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and
products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential
business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value
of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We
continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies,
but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will
be able to enforce such protections.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results
are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors.
Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future
performance.
Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the
future include, but are not limited to:
•our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
•our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of
our products and services;
•fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies;
•changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;
•our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
•our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
•product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
•our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
•supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products
•inventory write-downs;
•our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our
partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our
partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors;
•the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit
insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;
•customer bad debt write-offs;
•any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
•unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
•changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
•general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results.
Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our
stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.

Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and
potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory
proceedings.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is
subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use,
retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could
damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected,
used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased
security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased
costs related to defending legal claims.
Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data
protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General
Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies to meet new requirements effective as of May 2018
regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to
correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4%
of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United
States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is
inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying
with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an
adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result
in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by
higher than expected tax rates.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll,
sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various
foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses
in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and
other tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to
multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as
we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.
Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or
statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in
available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted
accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not
deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax
valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based
compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the
period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the
United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our
international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in
our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or
investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global
basis. For example, multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers
based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of
cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. In addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the Company, filed a
derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the Company against the members of our board of directors and
certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory
and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.
Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary
damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business
practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement
may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In
addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
19
Table of Contents
In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be
required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.
Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft
Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may
discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an
interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change
of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws
contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
These provisions include the following:
•the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
•the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
•advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
•the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
•a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
•the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
•the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.
On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips
and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an
individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and
the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also
discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause
us to take other corporate actions they desire.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
Not applicable.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California. It includes twelve leased commercial buildings totaling
1,093,529 square feet, and real property that we own totaling 720,046 square feet. Our owned property consists of two
commercial buildings and a building under construction. The construction is targeted for completion in fiscal year 2022.
In addition, we also lease data center space in Santa Clara, California.
Outside of Santa Clara, California, we lease facilities in a number of regional facilities in other U.S. locations that are
used as research and development centers and/or sales and administrative offices. Outside of the United States, we
own a building in Hyderabad, India, that is being used primarily as a research and development center. We also lease
facilities in various international locations that are used as research and development centers and/or sales and
administrative offices. These leased facilities are located primarily in Asia and Europe. In addition, we also lease data
center space in various locations around the world.
We believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the next twelve months. For
additional information regarding obligations under leases, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is hereby incorporated by
reference.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND
ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our
common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of
February 14, 2020, we had approximately 301 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or
nominee name.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a
total cost of $7.08 billion through January 26, 2020. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into
treasury stock.
As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock
up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share
repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other
factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program
may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020,
including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we
returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend
to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox.
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon
the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2020, we
withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $551 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a
focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained
demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to
create platforms for VR, HPC, and AI.
Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture.
From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is
critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive.
Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla
and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra
brand incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as
well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in
Delaware in April 1998.

Professional Visualization revenue was $1.21 billion, up 7% from a year ago, reflecting strength in desktop and
notebook workstations.
Data Center revenue was $2.98 billion, up 2% from a year ago, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by
lower hyperscale sales.
Automotive revenue was $700 million, up 9% from a year ago, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and
development services agreements.

OEM and Other revenue was $505 million, down 34% from a year ago, primarily due to the absence of cryptocurrency-
specific product sales.
Gross margin for fiscal year 2020 was 62.0%, up 80 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced inventory
provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.
Operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee
additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and
infrastructure costs.
Income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier. Net income and net
income per diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were $2.80 billion and $4.52, respectively, both down 32% from a year
earlier reflecting lower revenue and higher operating expenses.
On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox
Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of
Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of
the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The
consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the
satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and
performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019,
Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal
from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commission in December 2019. In addition, the waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition
expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are
progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement
is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be
obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.
In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020,
including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we
returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend
to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020, compared with $7.42
billion as of January 27, 2019. The increase primarily reflects growth in operating cash flow.
In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and
commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We have
operations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our
customers and suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related
restrictions and closures. The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full
extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business.

develop, train and validate self-driving vehicles; unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE AP2X automated driving solution,
encompassing DRIVE AutoPilot software, DRIVE AGX and DRIVE validation tools; introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE AV
Safety Force Field to enable safe, comfortable driving experiences; and announced availability of the NVIDIA DRIVE
Constellation autonomous vehicle simulation platform.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related
disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories,
revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of
these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit
Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net
realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the
write-off of excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase
commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions,
changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence
because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or
unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase
orders could result in our holding excess inventory.
The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was
insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. The charges we took to cost of
sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and
prior architecture components and chips. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to
purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party
manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing
actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand
for our products.
Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further
discussion.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,
and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract
with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction
price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of
revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
26
Table of Contents
Product Sales Revenue
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of
allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if
product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional
sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in
various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that
are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also
promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential
rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.
License and Development Arrangements
Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual
property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development
services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We
measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost
required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a
provision for such loss in that period.
Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or
refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or
liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based
on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing
with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may
change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax
laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In
addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate
of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is
unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an
income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax
assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable
income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the
extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset
as an income tax benefit during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon
audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of
potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process
compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two
reporting units,
27
Table of Contents
GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and
Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 26, 2020 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting
units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and
inherently uncertain.
We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative
assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.
Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs. Revenue from
Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations.
Data Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth
partially offset by lower hyperscale sales.
Tegra Processor Business.  Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to
fiscal year 2019. This was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by
an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services
agreements.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal
years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the
location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different
location.
Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the
cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,
board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases,
final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of
revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related
to personnel associated with manufacturing.
Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in fiscal year
2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.
Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales of
inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and
2019, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an
unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.
A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal
year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.
Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year
2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019.

Total Other Income, Net
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was
$178 million and $136 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily
due to higher average invested balances.
Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes
Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016. Interest expense was $52 million and $58 million in
fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Other, Net
Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and the impact
of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was not significant during fiscal year 2020 and was $14 million of
income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments.
Income Taxes
We recognized income tax expense of $174 million for fiscal year 2020 and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal
year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9% and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The
increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of
tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily
to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than
the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits
related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in
2019.

Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower
purchases, higher sales, and lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of Mellanox.
Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no share
repurchases in fiscal year 2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated
by our operations. As of January 26, 2020, we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months,
including our proposed acquisition of Mellanox. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, highly
rated corporations and financial institutions, asset-backed issuers, and foreign government entities. These marketable
securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
During fiscal year 2021, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $700 million to $900 million to fund
property and equipment including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus.
As a result of the TCJA, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the
United States as of January 26, 2020 are available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal
income taxes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Capital Return to Shareholders
In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020,
including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we
returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend
to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox. As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized,
subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's
continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests
of our shareholders. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this

Excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of $211 million which consists of $180 million and the
related interest and penalties of $31 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 26, 2020. We are
unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years
due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax
positions. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The
investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs
and strategic growth of our businesses.
As of January 26, 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments.
According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair
values for these investments of $1 million.
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry
the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a
fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign
currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of
foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2020
and 2019.
Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and,
therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to
other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete.
Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers
raising their

prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected
by a weaker dollar.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our
operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge
relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are
recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other
income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 26, 2020, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020 based on the criteria set forth in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 26, 2020.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is
included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are

met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
NVIDIA have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January
26, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management
37
Table of Contents
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical
audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.
Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory
provisions to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or
excess inventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products,
based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about
future demand and market conditions. Management applies significant judgment in the valuation of inventories, which
involves estimating future demand and market conditions. As of January 26, 2020, the Company’s consolidated
inventories balance was $979 million.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories,
specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are that there was significant
judgment by management when developing their provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including
management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures over the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, which
included evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s
assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing
management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness
of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the
approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market
conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating
whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including
historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and
(iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in
Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were
52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 will be a 53-week year.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,
income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and
other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,
and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract
with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction
price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of
revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Product Sales Revenue
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of
allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if
product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional
sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in
various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that
are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also
promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential
rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

License and Development Arrangements
Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual
property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development
services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We
measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost
required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a
provision for such loss in that period.
Software Licensing
Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.
Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over
which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer
support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative
standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for
each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made
available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
Advertising Expenses
We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2020,
2019, and 2018 were $15 million, $21 million, and $25 million, respectively. 
Product Warranties
We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or
replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the
estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited
circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known
warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Stock-based Compensation
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair
value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate
financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value
of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense
for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee
service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We
estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-
Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based
compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures
annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many
uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-
party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information
becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements
is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially
different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets
and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and
expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to
the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from
foreign currency

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have
not been significant.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or
refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or
liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based
on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing
with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may
change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax
laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In
addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate
of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is
unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an
income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax
assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable
income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the
extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset
as an income tax benefit during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon
audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially
dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the
effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when
their effect is anti-dilutive.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when
purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These debt
securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt
securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary
impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method
and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to
earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have
other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost
basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument,
(2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or
(3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these
situations, we recognize an
47
Table of Contents
NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized
cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired
due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the
instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit
loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other
factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019. Marketable securities
are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses
included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair
value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized
as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as
fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting
losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-
flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other
comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed
income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our
portfolio duration. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts
receivable, was approximately 21% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 26, 2020 and
19% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 27, 2019. We perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance
consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our
overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.
Accounts Receivable
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer
issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of
gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit
insurance or letters of credit.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including
wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead
associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory
products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to
the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory
provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product
purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has
been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line
method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for
retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or
loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the
amortization
48
Table of Contents
NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are
amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12
months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for
the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments
discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and
prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of
potential impairment exist.  For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a
quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. 
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events
and factors affecting the reporting units.
Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting
unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not
limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples
from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding
industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Refer to Note 6 of these Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property,
trademarks and customer relationships. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods
ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible
asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line
amortization method.
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset,
or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an
impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the
estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be
separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting
for leases under which lease assets and liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet. We adopted this guidance on
January

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
28, 2019 using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated
balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under
current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of
reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking
expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt
securities. We plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2021. We do not currently believe it will have a material impact upon adoption.
Note 2 - Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.
On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox
Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of
Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of
the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The
consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the
satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and
performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019,
Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal
from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commission in December 2019. In addition, the waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition
expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are
progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement
is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be
obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.
Note 3 - New Lease Accounting Standard
Method and Impact of Adoption
On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by
recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative
information for prior periods. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition
guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2)
lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases.
The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of
$470 million of operating lease assets and $500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet. The difference of $30 million represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which
was an offset to the opening balance of operating lease assets.
Lease Obligations
Our lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office
facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2021 and 2035.

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the
purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest
rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is
estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and
market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs,
and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.
Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates
of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on
historical experience.
Equity Incentive Program
We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the
following equity incentive plans.
Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended
and restated, the 2007 Plan.
The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-
based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to
230 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007
Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 26,
2020, there were 29 million shares available for future issuance.
Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vested over a four-year period, subject to
continued service, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of
the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock
options generally expire ten years from the date of grant.
Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four-year period, subject to continued
service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants
made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016,
6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the
date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is
generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.
Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or
terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended
or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing
requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved
the amendment.

Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated,
the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Up to 89 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of
January 26, 2020, we had issued 30 million shares and reserved 59 million shares for future issuance under the 2012
Plan.
The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months,
which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months.
Employees or those employed by an affiliate of ours are eligible to participate as designated by the Board. Employees
who participate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board
may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan
will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each
offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering.

Note 9 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or
quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly
basis. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for fiscal year 2020.
Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our
own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements
on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment.
Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to
operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019.
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other
income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 26,

currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.
During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting
treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be
highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.
Note 12 - Debt
Long-Term Debt
2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due
2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year. Upon 30
days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that
include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid
for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or
after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance
costs.
The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our
subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

Litigation
Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits
On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669),
naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar
purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia
Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. On
February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead
plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel. On March 12, 2019, the two cases were
consolidated under case number 4:18-cv-07669-HSG and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. On May
2, 2019, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated
class action complaint. The consolidated complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or
misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between
May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. The plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as
defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified
compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and
further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On August 2, 2019, NVIDIA moved

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of
the securities laws by NVIDIA or the named defendants.
On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern
District of California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of
NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA’s board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach
of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory
and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and other
relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February
12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v.
Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February
19, 2019, a third substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The
Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking
substantially the same relief. On March 12, 2019, the three derivative actions were consolidated under case number
4:19-cv-00341-HSG, and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation. The parties stipulated to
stay the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation pending resolution of any motion to dismiss that
NVIDIA may file in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.
On September 24, 2019, two shareholders, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed two identical lawsuits in the
District of Delaware. One is captioned Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and the other is
captioned Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA). The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary
duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections
14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements
related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate
governance measures. On December 11, 2019, the court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the Lipchitz and
Huang actions pending resolution of the motion to dismiss filed by NVIDIA in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities
Litigation.
It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or
other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be
no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. As of January 26, 2020, we have not recorded any
accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that
liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range
of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We recognized an income tax expense of $174 million and $149 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2018, respectively,
and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9%, (6.3)%, and 4.7%
for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as
compared to fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based
compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA.
The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a
decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of
the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal
year 2019.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily
to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than
the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits
related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in
2019.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily
to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom,
where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax
credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million and $562 million,
respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be
realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax
assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the
period.

As of January 26, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $70 million, $153 million
and $295 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2021,
respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $295 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of
January 26, 2020, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $314 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year
2039. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $814 million, of which $774 million is attributable to the State
of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $40 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to
expire in fiscal year 2021. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit
and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts
and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also
be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and
similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.
As of January 26, 2020, we had $583 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $464 million would affect our
effective tax rate if recognized. However, $104 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax
positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a
full valuation allowance. The $464 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 26, 2020 consisted of $180 million
recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $284 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax
assets.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

 (In millions)
Balance at beginning of period $ 477 $ 447$ 224

Increases in tax positions for current year 104 129 222
Lapse in statute of limitations (5) (10) (5)
Balance at end of period $ 583 $ 477$ 447
We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate
payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or
reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income
taxes during a period beyond a year.
Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense. As of January 26, 2020, January 27, 2019, and January 28, 2018, we had accrued $31 million, $21 million,
and $15 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not
included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 26, 2020, unrecognized tax benefits of $180
million and the related interest and penalties of $31 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be
greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to
be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise
resolved. As of January 26, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions
will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 26, 2020,
the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
China, United Kingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2019. As of January 26, 2020, the significant
tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India, China, and United Kingdom for fiscal years
2003 through 2019.

Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity
Capital Return Program
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Through January 26, 2020, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase
program for a total cost of $7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury
stock. As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our
common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
During fiscal year 2020, we paid $390 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.
Preferred Stock
As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
Common Stock
We are authorized to issue up to 2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value.
Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans
We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, participating
employees may defer up to 80% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution
limits and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and
2018 was $44 million, $39 million, and $23 million, respectively. We also have defined contribution retirement plans
outside of the United States to which we contributed $32 million, $31 million, and $25 million for fiscal years 2020,
2019, and 2018, respectively.
Note 17 - Segment Information 
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial
information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business -
based on a single underlying graphics architecture.
Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla
and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra
brand incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as
well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.
Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise
by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the
Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where
the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those
expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.
The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to
either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing
financial performance. The revenue included in all other is Intel licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-
based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related
and other costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable
segments do not record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies
for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of
our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.
