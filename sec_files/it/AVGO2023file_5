ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor
and infrastructure software solutions. Our over 50-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse
origins from Hewlett-Packard Company, AT&T, LSI Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade
Communications Systems LLC, CA, Inc., Symantec Enterprise Security, and VMware, Inc. (“VMware”). Over
the years, we have assembled a large team of semiconductor and software design engineers around the
world. We maintain design, product and software development engineering resources at locations in the
U.S., Asia, Europe and Israel, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We strategically focus our
research and development resources to address niche opportunities in our target markets and leverage our
extensive portfolio of U.S. and other patents, and other intellectual property (“IP”) to integrate multiple
technologies and create system-on-chip (“SoC”) component and software solutions that target growth
opportunities. We design products and software that deliver high-performance and provide mission critical
functionality.
We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of
innovation in the semiconductor industry and oﬀer thousands of products that are used in end products
such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes (“STB”), broadband
access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage
systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.
We diﬀerentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities and focus on
developing products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.
Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and
secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms. Many of the largest
companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our
software solutions to help manage and secure their on-premise and hybrid cloud environments. Our
portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and
secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency
and security. We also oﬀer mission critical ﬁbre channel storage area networking (“FC SAN”) products and
related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor
products.
In addition, the hybrid-cloud portfolio we acquired with VMware helps enterprises simplify their
information technology (“IT”) environments so they can increase business velocity and ﬂexibility. The
VMware portfolio spans hybrid cloud, app-delivery acceleration, zero-trust security, and software-deﬁned
edge, making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads across private, public and edge
environments with security and resiliency.
Business Strategy
Our strategy is to combine best-of-breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure
software solutions, with unmatched scale, on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a
comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading business and government
customers. We seek to achieve this through responsibly ﬁnanced acquisitions of category-leading
businesses and technologies, as well as investing extensively in research and development, to ensure our
products retain their technology leadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to
drive diversiﬁed and sustainable operating and ﬁnancial results.
Recent Development
Acquisition of VMware, Inc.
On November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the “VMware Merger”),
in which VMware stockholders received, in aggregate, approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 54.4 million
shares of Broadcom common stock in exchange for all shares of VMware common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the closing. The preliminary total purchase consideration for the VMware
Merger was approximately $86.3 billion. We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger consideration
with net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term loans under a credit agreement that we
entered into on August 15, 2023, as well as cash on hand.
We assumed all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards and performance stock unit
awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards were converted into approximately 5 million
Broadcom RSU awards. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-
employee directors were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom
common stock, in equal parts.
All discussions and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our business and ﬁnancial
results relate solely to our operations prior to the VMware Merger, unless otherwise indicated.

entire environment, to help organizations identify and protect risky users, applications and their most
sensitive data everywhere across endpoints, on-premises networks, cloud services and private applications.
Identity Security: User identities are under attack by cyber criminals hoping to exploit their access
and privileges and do harm. We mitigate these attacks by positively identifying legitimate users, enforcing
granular access control policies, and streamlining access governance to prevent unauthorized access to
sensitive resources and data.
Fibre Channel Switch Products: Our Brocade Fibre Channel switch products provide
interconnection, bandwidth and high-speed switching between servers and storage devices which are in a
FC SAN. FC SANs are networks dedicated to mission critical storage traﬃc, and enable simultaneous high
speed and secure connections among multiple host computers and multiple storage arrays.
Payment Security Suite: This is a software as a service (“SaaS”)-based payment authentication
service to help banks and merchants protect against fraud and ensure a hassle-free online shopping
experience for their customers.
Research and Development
We are committed to continuous investment in product development and enhancement, with a focus
on rapidly introducing new, proprietary products and releases. Many of our products have grown out of our
own research and development eﬀorts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain target
markets due to performance diﬀerentiation. However, we opportunistically seek to enhance our capabilities
through the acquisition of engineers with complementary research and development skills and
complementary technologies and businesses. We focus our research and development eﬀorts on the
development of mission critical, innovative, sustainable and higher value product platforms and those that
improve the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products. We leverage our design capabilities in
markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by
developing high value-add products.

Table of Contents
We plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and through acquisitions, to
drive growth in our business. We also invest in process development and improvements to product features
and functions, as well as fabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured
internally. Our ﬁeld application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development
engineers are located in many places around the world, and in many cases near our top customers. This
enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our
semiconductor customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development
cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume manufacturing and future growth. By
collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products
for them that leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make signiﬁcant
research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position, and to ensure a
continuous ﬂow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.
Customers, Sales and Distribution
We sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel
partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the
substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a
signiﬁcant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of our net revenue
for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top ﬁve end customers,
through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our ﬁscal years 2023
and 2022. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20%
of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We expect to continue to experience signiﬁcant
customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or signiﬁcant decrease in demand from, any of our
top ﬁve end customers could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations and
ﬁnancial condition.
Many of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then
manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships
with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors
with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide
variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM
customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM
customers, and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell speciﬁc oﬀerings at
key levels throughout a customer’s organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them
directly and with speciﬁed intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer
relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product
development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise
regarding our customers’ requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration
has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more eﬃcient
and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. Many of our customers and their
contract manufacturers often require time critical delivery of our products to multiple locations around the
world. With sales oﬃces located in various countries, our primary warehouse in Malaysia, and dedicated
regional customer support call centers, where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other
order fulﬁllment requirements, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customers throughout the
design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies.
Our software customers are in most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies,
other ﬁnancial services providers, government agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication
providers, transportation companies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational
organizations and health care institutions. Our customers generally consist of large enterprises that have
computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We remain focused on
strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe-centric, and
Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software oﬀerings with these
customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to oﬀer our customers reduced
complexity, more ﬂexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.
Manufacturing Operations
We focus on maintaining an eﬃcient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model.
Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and
assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The majority of
our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a
signiﬁcant majority of our assembly and test operations, including TSMC, Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries
Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary
processes, such as our FBAR ﬁlters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting
laser and side emitting lasers-based on GaAs and InP lasers for ﬁber optic communications, while
outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. By doing so, we can protect our IP and
accelerate time to market for our products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer
fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore.

Table of Contents
We also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our
products and materials. We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and
our presence in Asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities.
Manufacturing Materials and Suppliers
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical
components and assemblies and raw materials. We purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a
global basis. These purchases are generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily
available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and cost necessary for
re-design or qualiﬁcation. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of
techniques, including redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or “lifetime”
purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers
allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to
monitor our suppliers' ﬁnancial health. Some suppliers may, nonetheless, extend their lead times, limit
supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique or highly
specialized components, we may not be able to ﬁnd a substitute quickly, or at all.
Competition
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large,
international companies oﬀering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow
markets. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many
industries, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while
others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect
competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve
or expand their product oﬀerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to
compete eﬀectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price,
product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise,
responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability,
and customer sales and technical support.
In the semiconductor market, we compete with integrated device manufacturers, fabless
semiconductor companies, as well as the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. Our primary
competitors are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Amlogic Inc., Analog Devices, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc.,
GlobalFoundries Inc., Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, iC-Haus GmbH, Intel Corporation,
Lumentum Holdings Inc., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Marvell Technology, Inc., MaxLinear,
Inc., MediaTek Inc., Microchip Technology Incorporated, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Murata
Manufacturing Co., Ltd., NVIDIA Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation,
OSRAM Licht AG, Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Renesas Electronics
Corporation, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Sumitomo Corporation, Synaptics
Incorporated, Texas Instruments, Inc., TDK-EPC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Wolfspeed, Inc. (f/k/a
Cree, Inc.), and II-VI Incorporated. We compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed
proprietary design expertise, FBAR technology, ampliﬁer design, module integration, proprietary materials
processes, multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design, our broad product portfolio, support of key
industry standards, reputation for quality products, and our customer relationships.
In the infrastructure software market, we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue
to expand their product and service oﬀerings and consolidate oﬀerings into broad product lines, and
smaller, niche players focused on speciﬁc markets. Our primary competitors are Atlassian Corporation, Plc,
BeyondTrust Corporation, BMC Software Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk
Software, Ltd., Dino-Software Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft
Corporation, New Relic, Inc., OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket Software,
Inc., SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation,
Splunk, Inc. and Zscaler, Inc. We compete based on the breadth of our enterprise management tools
portfolio, breadth and synergy of oﬀerings, our platform and hardware independence, our global reach, and
our deep customer relationships and industry experience.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a
combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar
IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants,
and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key
engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application
speciﬁc products in key target markets.
As of October 29, 2023, we had 15,400 U.S. and other patents and 910 U.S. and other pending patent
applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2023 to 2042, with a small number of patents
expiring in the near future, none of
10
Table of Contents
which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single
patent or group of related patents.
We focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements
that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research.
However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of
patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.
We and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing
arrangements that have both beneﬁted our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our
revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We
also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities,
products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us
have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.
The industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents,
copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP
rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer
agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our
products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future
customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or
distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease
manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop non-infringing
technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or
relinquish patents or other IP rights.
With respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products
are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components
that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for
our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and
SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS oﬀerings. Under certain contingent
circumstances, some of our customers are beneﬁciaries of a source code escrow arrangement that would
enable them to obtain a limited right to access and use our source code if speciﬁc conditions are met.
Employees
Our continued success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain our workforce in a highly
competitive labor market. Speciﬁcally, as the source of our technological and product innovations, our
engineering and technical personnel are a critical asset.
We measure our employees’ engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and employee feedback. Our
global voluntary attrition rate in ﬁscal year 2023 was approximately 3.3%, well below the technology
industry benchmark (AON, 2023 Salary Increase and Turnover Study — Second Edition, September 2023).
We also track the portion of our workforce in research and development roles. As of October 29, 2023,
we had approximately 20,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 63% in research and development
roles. By geography, approximately 54% of our employees are located in North America, 34% in Asia, and
12% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Governmental Regulation
Our semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of
hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health,
safety and the environment. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water,
and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and
handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and treatment,
transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are also subject to regulation by the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions.
We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with
applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental
liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of
environmental, health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur signiﬁcant expenditures.
We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding
recycling, product packaging and product content requirements, including legislation enacted in the U.S.,
European Union and China, among a growing number of jurisdictions, which have placed greater
restrictions on the use of lead, among other restricted substances, in electronic products, which aﬀects
materials composition and semiconductor packaging. In addition, our business is subject
11
Table of Contents
to various import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable
executive orders, and rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Organization for
Standardization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
(“FTC”). These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice,
have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may incur signiﬁcant
expenditures in future periods as a result.
Seasonality
Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the ﬁscal year than in the
ﬁrst half, primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications products. These products have
historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile devices manufactured by our OEM
customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by
other factors such as wider macroeconomic eﬀects, the timing of signiﬁcant product transitions and
launches by large OEMs, particularly with our wireless communications products. We have a diversiﬁed
business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a
result of this diversiﬁcation.

Risks Related to Our Business
Adverse global economic conditions could have a negative eﬀect on our business, results of
operations and ﬁnancial condition and liquidity.
A general slowdown in the global economy, including a recession, or in a particular region or industry,
an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners, inﬂation or a tightening of the credit markets could
negatively impact our business, ﬁnancial condition and liquidity. Adverse global economic conditions have
from time to time caused or exacerbated signiﬁcant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we
operate, which have adversely aﬀected our business and results of operations. Macroeconomic weakness
and uncertainty also make it more diﬃcult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and
expenses, and may make it more diﬃcult to raise or reﬁnance debt. An escalation of trade tensions
between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions, increased protectionism and increased tariﬀs
that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets or compete eﬀectively with Chinese companies.
Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of
trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China, and possible decoupling of the
U.S. and China economies, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global
trade. Such events may also (i) cause our customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology
spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or
tariﬀs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing
pressures. Any or all of these factors could negatively aﬀect demand for our products and our business,
ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these
regulations may cause us to incur signiﬁcant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with
applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain
products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties.
Our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements,
including anti-competition and import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration
Regulations, and applicable executive orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change
frequently and with limited notice, and have generally and may continue to become more stringent over
time. We may be required to incur signiﬁcant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these
regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to
suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of
operations. The U.S. government may also add companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to
its list of prohibited exports to speciﬁc countries, which have had and may continue to have an adverse
eﬀect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue. For example, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., one
of our customers, is subject to certain U.S. export restrictions, which has required us to suspend sales to
Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. We may be unable to obtain or
maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export products to them. These restrictive governmental
actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by other governments,
especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or prevent us from doing business
with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete eﬀectively or otherwise
negatively aﬀect our ability to sell our products, and adversely aﬀect our business and results of
operations. Furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions for the
supply of products or require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, which could have a
material adverse eﬀect on our business.
Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies,
such as the FTC. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory
investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into
certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative
proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to
result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement
activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time
consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.
If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be
required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay ﬁnes or disgorge
proﬁts or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business
practices, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of
operations. We may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former
directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations.
These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law
enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal ﬁnes and penalties.
In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and
adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur. For example, if a country in which our products
are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared, it may require us to stop
distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead certain of our
customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to
manufacture products with diﬀerent technical standards and disrupt cross-border
16

manufacturing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial
condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could also be required
to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution.
Global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international
operations could adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
A majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue
represents a signiﬁcant percentage of our overall revenue. In addition, as of October 29, 2023, nearly 49%
of our employees were located outside the U.S. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and
to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial
condition and results of operations. These factors include:
•changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions or geopolitical turmoil (including China-
Taiwan relations), including terrorism, war or political or military coups, state-sponsored or politically
motivated cyber-attacks, or civil disturbances or political instability (foreign and domestic);
•restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and
foreign investments, data privacy regulations, imposition of climate change regulations, and trade
protection measures, including increasing protectionism, import/export restrictions (including with
regards to advanced technologies), import/export duties and quotas, trade sanctions and customs
duties and tariﬀs, all of which have increased in recent years;
•diﬃculty in obtaining product distribution and support, and transportation delays;
•potential inability to localize software products;
•diﬃculty in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts receivables and maintaining appropriate
ﬁnancial control;
•diﬃculty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners;
•public health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and other
natural- or man-made disasters;
•nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets; and
•changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws.
A signiﬁcant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the
various and diﬀering laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business. In addition, the
laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conﬂict with each other or with
agreements we have made in one or more jurisdictions. Although our policies prohibit us, our employees
and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance that all of our
employees, distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti-corruption or
other policies and procedures. Any such violation could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business.
Failure to realize the beneﬁts expected from the VMware Merger could adversely aﬀect our
business and the value of our common stock.
As part of our integration of the VMware business, we plan to focus on VMware’s core business of
creating private and hybrid cloud environments among large enterprises globally and divesting non-core
assets. If VMware customers do not accept this plan, the investments we have made or may make to
implement this plan may be of no or limited value, we may lose customers, our ﬁnancial results may be
adversely aﬀected and our stock price may suﬀer.
Although we expect signiﬁcant beneﬁts to result from the VMware Merger, there can be no assurance
that we will actually realize these beneﬁts. Achieving these beneﬁts will depend, in part, on our ability to
integrate VMware's business successfully and eﬃciently. The challenges involved in this integration, which
are complex and time consuming, include the following:
•preserving customer and other important relationships of VMware and attracting new business and
operational relationships;
•integrating ﬁnancial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
•consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, ﬁnance and administrative
infrastructures;
•coordinating sales and marketing eﬀorts to eﬀectively position our capabilities;
•coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
17
Table of Contents
•reorienting the VMware sales and marketing force to align with the change in strategy and
eﬀectively position the business; and
•integrating the VMware workforce, including managing employee transitions and attrition,
maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees.
If we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an
acquired business, then we may not achieve the anticipated beneﬁts of the VMware Merger within our
anticipated timeframe or at all and our revenue, expenses, operating results, ﬁnancial condition and stock
price could be materially adversely aﬀected. The successful integration of the VMware business will require
signiﬁcant management attention both before and after the completion of the VMware Merger, and may
divert the attention of management from our business and operational issues.
We may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could
adversely aﬀect our results of operations.
Our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that oﬀer complementary products,
services and technologies, or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities.
Any acquisitions we may undertake, including the VMware Merger, and their integration involve risks
and uncertainties, such as:
•unexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our business;
•diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities;
•incurring signiﬁcant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities (some of
which may be unexpected) and ongoing or new lawsuits, potential impairment of acquired goodwill
and other intangible assets, and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements;
•the potential for deﬁciencies in internal controls at the acquired business, as well as implementing
our own management information systems, operating systems and internal controls for the acquired
operations;
•our due diligence process may fail to identify signiﬁcant issues with the acquired business’ products,
ﬁnancial disclosures, accounting practices, legal, tax and other contingencies, compliance with local
laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) in the U.S. and multiple international jurisdictions;
•additional acquisition-related debt, which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively
aﬀect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs
thereby limiting our ability to borrow;
•dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;
•diﬃculties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired
employees, vendors and customers; and
•inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction, which may
result in us not realizing the expected ﬁnancial or strategic beneﬁts of any such transaction.
In addition, current and future changes to the U.S. and foreign regulatory approval process and
requirements related to acquisitions may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated, not be
forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions, which may prevent the transaction or jeopardize, delay or
reduce the anticipated beneﬁts of the transaction, and impede the execution of our business strategy.
From time to time, we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business, either acquired or
otherwise, or we may exit minority investments, any of which could materially aﬀect our cash ﬂows and
results of operations. Such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties, including our ability to sell such
businesses on terms acceptable to us, or at all, disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of
employees or customers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any
such dispositions. In addition, dispositions may include the transfer of technology and/or the licensing of
certain IP rights to third-party purchasers, which could limit our ability to utilize such IP rights or assert
these rights against such third-party purchasers or other third parties.
We are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including
product inventory levels and product sell-through.
We sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel
partners globally. Sales to distributors accounted for 57% of our net revenue in the ﬁscal year ended
October 29, 2023 and are subject to a number of risks, including:
18
Table of Contents
•ﬂuctuations in demand based on our distributors’ product inventory levels and end customer
demand;
•our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales
requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers;
•our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be
terminated at any time without cause;
•our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers; and
•our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may
place greater emphasis on the sale of these products.
We expect our dependence on channel partners will increase following the VMware Merger. Failure to
maintain good relationships with our distributors and channel partners could adversely impact our
business. In addition, we sell our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of
distributors, which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks.
We do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products. As a result, our
semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or
tested, including, for example, medical devices, and they may not perform as anticipated in such
applications. In such event, failure of even a small number of parts could result in signiﬁcant liabilities to
us, damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations.
Our business would be adversely aﬀected by the departure of existing members of our senior
management team.
Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team,
and in particular, the services of Hock E. Tan, our President and Chief Executive Oﬃcer. Eﬀective succession
planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure eﬀective transfers of knowledge and
smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. None
of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts. In addition, we do not currently
maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any of our senior
management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly
changing market conditions in which we operate.
If we are unable to attract and retain qualiﬁed personnel, especially our engineering and
technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy eﬀectively.
Our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualiﬁed personnel. As the
source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel (including
cyber security experts) are a signiﬁcant asset. Competition for these employees is signiﬁcant in many areas
of the world in which we operate, particularly in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualiﬁed engineers
are in high demand. In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more diﬃcult to hire or
retain qualiﬁed engineers, further limiting the pool of available talent. We believe equity awards provide a
powerful long-term retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial
majority of our employees. If we are unable to continue our current equity granting philosophy, this could
impair our eﬀorts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such
personnel and provide competitive employment beneﬁts could have a material adverse eﬀect on our
business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
An impairment of the conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of
one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse eﬀect on
our business.
Our business depends on a wide variety of complex IT systems and services, including cloud-based and
other critical corporate services relating to, among other things, product research and development,
ﬁnancial reporting, product orders and fulﬁllment, HR, beneﬁt plan administration, IT network management,
and electronic communication and collaboration services. These systems and services are both internally
managed and outsourced, and in many cases we rely upon third-party data centers. Any failure of these
internal or third-party systems and services to operate eﬀectively could disrupt our operations and could
have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. Our operations
are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity
events that could have a signiﬁcant disruptive eﬀect. Although these systems are designed to protect and
secure our customers’, suppliers’ and employees’ conﬁdential information, as well as our own proprietary
information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security
threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use and technologies produced by us have
occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmitigated, could
reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed.
Cyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-ﬁnanced, in some cases supported
by state actors, and are designed to not only attack, but also to evade detection. Since the techniques used
to obtain unauthorized access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are often
not recognized until launched against a target, we
19
Table of Contents
may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As a
critical vendor in the digital supply chain for both governmental entities and critical infrastructure
operators, we and our products may be targeted by those seeking to threaten the conﬁdentiality, integrity
and availability of systems supporting essential public services. Geopolitical instability may increase the
likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conﬂicts between nation-
states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure.
Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the
systems of our service providers and business partners, or the existence of computer viruses or malware
(such as ransomware) in our or their data or software have in the past, and could in the future, expose us to
a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and conﬁdential
information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our
employees or third parties. Such an event could disrupt our business and result in, among other things,
unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive
information, litigation by aﬀected parties and possible ﬁnancial obligations for liabilities and damages
related to the theft or misuse of such information, signiﬁcant remediation costs, disruption of key business
operations and signiﬁcant diversion of our resources, as well as ﬁnes and other sanctions resulting from any
related breaches of data privacy regulations (such as the General Data Protection Regulation), any of which
could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, proﬁtability and ﬁnancial condition. While we may be
entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any award may be
insuﬃcient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform, we may
be unable to collect any damages.
Despite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have, from time to time, been
subject to disruptive cyber-attacks and unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT
networks or those of our service providers or business partners. Although no such cyber security incidents
have been material to Broadcom, we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from
unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future.
Businesses we acquire may increase the scope and complexity of our IT networks, and this may increase
our risk exposure to cyber-attacks when there are diﬃculties integrating diverse legacy systems that
support operations for the acquired businesses.
In addition, certain aspects of eﬀective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors
and other trusted partners reliably safeguarding secrets (e.g., application credentials) and adhering to our
security policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future
to experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle such secrets or adhere to such
policies and, although no such events have had a material adverse eﬀect on our business, there can be no
assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to Broadcom. Our logging,
alerting and cyber incident detection mechanisms may not cover every system potentially targeted by
threat actors, may not have the capability to detect certain types of unauthorized activities, and may not
capture and surface information suﬃcient to enable us to timely detect and take responsive action to
insider or external threats.
U.S. and foreign regulators, as well as customers and service providers, have also increased their focus
on cyber security vulnerabilities and risks. Compliance with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions
concerning privacy, cyber security, secure technology development, data governance, data protection,
conﬁdentiality and IP could result in signiﬁcant expense, and any failure to comply could result in
proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties and may also increase our overall
compliance burden.
We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.
The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by price erosion, wide ﬂuctuations in
product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards,
frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for many of the
end products in which they are used). From time to time, these factors, together with changes in general
economic conditions, cause signiﬁcant upturns and downturns in the industry in general, and in our
business in particular. The industry previously experienced a signiﬁcant upturn due to a supply imbalance
that resulted in record proﬁtability and increases in average selling prices. The industry, however is
currently experiencing a downturn, and historically, such down-cycles have been characterized by
diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment,
under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix, accelerated erosion of average selling
prices and elimination of expedite fees leading to reduced proﬁtability and a decline in our stock price. The
Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in
supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to
continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If
we cannot oﬀset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our ﬁnancial condition
and results of operations may suﬀer.

The majority of our sales have historically come from a small number of customers and a
reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our signiﬁcant customers may adversely aﬀect
our business.
We have historically depended on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective contract
manufacturers (“CMs”) and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue. For ﬁscal year
2023, sales to distributors accounted for 57% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales, through all
channels, to Apple and our top ﬁve end customers, accounted for approximately 20% and 35% of our net
revenue for ﬁscal year 2023, respectively. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly
ﬂuctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced
by our signiﬁcant customers.
Our semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase speciﬁc quantities of products.
Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such
arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of
products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result,
we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of proﬁtability we expect under such
arrangements. Moreover, our top customers’ purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability
to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. We expect this
trend to continue, which may adversely aﬀect our gross margin on certain products and, should we fail to
perform under these arrangements, we could also be liable for signiﬁcant monetary damages.
The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers could have a material
adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and cash ﬂows.
Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply
chain may adversely aﬀect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and
adversely aﬀect our results of operations.
We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes CMs, such as
third-party wafer foundries and module assembly and test capabilities. Our semiconductor products require
wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques, and most of our products
are designed to be manufactured in a speciﬁc process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our
own or with a particular CM.
We depend on our CMs to allocate suﬃcient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce
products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis.
We do not generally have long-term capacity commitments with our CMs and substantially all of our
manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities. Further, our CMs may
fail to timely develop new, advanced manufacturing processes, including transitions to smaller geometry
process technologies or, from time to time, will cease to, or will become unable to, manufacture a
component for us. As lead times to identify, qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields
with a new CM is typically lengthy, there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be
other constraints on our ability to change CMs. In addition, qualifying new CMs is often expensive, and they
may not produce products as cost-eﬀectively as our current suppliers.
TSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 90% of the wafers manufactured by our CMs during
ﬁscal year 2023. We believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC’s total
production capacity. However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including some of our
competitors, and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or
eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to
us.
If any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the
same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities.
This could damage our relationships with our customers or result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our
obligations, payment of signiﬁcant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely aﬀecting our
business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and gross margin.
Further, any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services that we utilize, including
TSMC’s supply of wafers to us, as a result of a natural disaster, climate change, water shortages, political
unrest, military conﬂicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, labor shortages, medical
epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could
materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.
We purchase a signiﬁcant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number
of suppliers.
Our manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and
InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and
various chemicals and gases. During ﬁscal year 2023, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our
manufacturing materials from ﬁve materials providers, some of which are single source suppliers. As
certain materials are highly specialized, the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is
typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-
term
21
Table of Contents
contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis.
Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices due to
commodity price increases, capacity constraints, inﬂation, or other factors, any of which could lead to
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. For example, macroeconomic and geopolitical
conditions, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, caused some supply constraints and increases in prices,
including with respect to wafers and substrates. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be
negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly
China. Any such supply constraints could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our
business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand
could adversely aﬀect our results of operations.
We make signiﬁcant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and
accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal
fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on customer requirements or estimates
thereof, which may not be accurate.
We largely build to order and have extended customer lead times substantially, which has limited and
may continue to limit our ability to fulﬁll orders and satisfy all of the demand for our products. Customers
may require rapid increases in production on short notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in
demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to
additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.
Conversely, if actual sales of our products is lower than expected, we may also experience higher
inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research
and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively ﬁxed, a reduction in
customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.
Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that
often requires us to incur signiﬁcant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no
revenue.
Our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as
“design wins”. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate signiﬁcant
development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity.
Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent
generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future
selection processes.
Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a
customer’s plans could materially and adversely aﬀect our ﬁnancial results, as we incur signiﬁcant expense
in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is
unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same
time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate
signiﬁcant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers will only
purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line
for those products. The qualiﬁcation process can take signiﬁcant time and resources. Delays in qualiﬁcation
or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a
signiﬁcant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could
fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause
us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely aﬀecting our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of
operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into
which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.
A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities,
warehouses or other signiﬁcant operations, or those of our suppliers, could have a material
adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own
manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania.
We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes.
Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of
our wireless devices and for the InP-based wafers used in our ﬁbre optics products, respectively. Many of
our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in California and the Paciﬁc Rim region, which
have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, a signiﬁcant majority of our
research and development personnel are located in the Czech Republic, India, Israel, and the U.S., with the
expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two speciﬁc areas, and our
primary warehouse is in Malaysia.
A prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses,
especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers,
due to natural- or man-made
22
Table of Contents
disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of
acute illness, including COVID-19, or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer
demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary,
were found. To date, we have not experienced a material event, however such an event could disrupt our
operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer
demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in signiﬁcant expense to repair or replace our
aﬀected facilities, and, in some instances, could signiﬁcantly curtail our research and development eﬀorts
in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially
lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities,
all of which could materially and adversely aﬀect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate
certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could
negatively aﬀect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of
our aﬀected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an
event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely aﬀect our results
of operations. Such events could also result in increased ﬁxed costs relative to the revenue we generate
and adversely aﬀect our results of operations.
We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our
own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely aﬀect our relationships with our
customers, and our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
We must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet
anticipated customer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements
of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Such expanded manufacturing
capacity may still be insuﬃcient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we
may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if
we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and ﬁxed costs at these facilities
will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely aﬀect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced
product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve signiﬁcant time and cost to
remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to
forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.
We may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, securities litigation, and employee-
related claims, which could, among other things, divert eﬀorts of management and result in
signiﬁcant expense and loss of our IP rights.
We are often involved in legal proceedings, including cases involving our IP rights and those of others,
commercial matters, acquisition-related suits, securities class action suits, employee-related claims and
other actions. Litigation or settlement of such actions, regardless of their merit, can be costly, lengthy,
complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical
personnel.
The industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents,
copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP
rights, including actions by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products. From time to time,
third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their IP rights to technologies that are
important to our business. For example, in September 2023 we settled a patent infringement claim ﬁled by
California Institute of Technology against Broadcom and Apple.
Many of our customer agreements, and in some cases our asset sale agreements, and/or the laws of
certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party IP infringement
claims, including costs to defend those claims, and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings.
However, our CMs and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers
be subject to such third-party claims. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our
customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any pending or future
proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:
•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and/or make
changes to our processes or products;
•pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology, including up
to treble damages if willful infringement is found;
•expend signiﬁcant resources to develop non-infringing technology;
•license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;
•enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall IP portfolio and our
ability to compete in particular product categories;
23
Table of Contents
•pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing
technology with non-infringing technology; or
•relinquish IP rights associated with one or more of our patent claims.
Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition
and results of operations.
In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former
directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with such litigation. These
liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of defending lawsuits against
these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits; civil or criminal ﬁnes and penalties; legal and
other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measure, if any, which may be imposed.
If demand for our data center virtualization products is less than anticipated, our business
could be adversely aﬀected.
We expect to generate a signiﬁcant portion of our software revenue from our data center virtualization
products. However, if businesses build new or shift existing compute workloads oﬀ-premises to public cloud
providers, this could limit the market for on-premises deployments of our data center virtualization
products. Although we have developed, and will continue to develop, products to extend our product
oﬀerings to the public cloud, if demand for our server virtualization products is signiﬁcantly less than
anticipated, our business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and cash ﬂows may be adversely
aﬀected.
The growth of our software business depends on customer acceptance of our newer products
and services.
Many of our software products and services are based on data center virtualization, application
modernization and related hybrid-cloud technologies used to manage distributed computing architectures,
which form the foundation for hybrid-cloud computing. We expect to increase product development and
marketing and sales eﬀorts toward products and services that enable businesses to modernize applications
and eﬃciently implement their hybrid-cloud services. These cloud and SaaS initiatives present new and
diﬃcult technological, operational and compliance challenges. We expect signiﬁcant investments will be
required to develop or acquire solutions to address those challenges. Current and future customers may not
perceive beneﬁts and cost savings associated with adopting our hybrid-cloud and application platform
solutions or we may fail to realize returns on our investments in new initiatives, which could harm our
results of operations.
If our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating
environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could
decrease, which could materially adversely aﬀect our business.
We may be required to make substantial modiﬁcation of our products to maintain compatibility with
operating systems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our
customers with desired features or capabilities. We must also continually address the challenges of
dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of
advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete eﬀectively. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments.
Further, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third
parties, as well as cloud providers. If we lose access to third-party code and speciﬁcations for the
development of code or cloud providers fail to support our products or otherwise limit the functionality,
compatibility or certiﬁcation of our products, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible
software. In addition, if software providers and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest
vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for
their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions
for such access, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and
modiﬁcation of our existing products or development of new products. Any additional restrictions could
materially adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition and operating results and cash ﬂow.
Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially
adversely aﬀect our business.
Many of our existing customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which
involve substantial aggregate fee amounts. These customers often do not have a contractual obligation to
purchase additional solutions. Customer renewal rates may decline or ﬂuctuate as a result of a number of
factors, including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support, customer
budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions oﬀered by our competitors, any of
which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at all. The failure to renew customer
agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely
aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition and operating results and cash ﬂow.
24
Table of Contents
Certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be
available to us in the future, which may delay product development and production or cause us
to incur additional expense.
Some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of which may not be available
to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss
of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay
development of future products or the enhancement of existing products.
Our use of open source software in certain products and services could materially adversely
aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition, operating results and cash ﬂow.
Many of our products and services incorporate open source software, the use of which may subject us to
certain conditions, including the obligation to oﬀer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary
source code of those products publicly available. Open source licenses are generally “as-is” and do not
provide warranties, support or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software, which exposes us to
potential liability if the software fails to work or infringes the intellectual property of a third-party.
Although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to unintended
conditions and exposing us to unacceptable ﬁnancial risk, such use, under certain circumstances, could
materially adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition and operating results and cash ﬂow, including if
we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development eﬀorts. In
addition, we may receive inquiries or claims from authors, distributors or recipients of open source software
included in our products regarding our compliance with the conditions of such open source licenses and we
may be required to take steps to avoid or remedy an alleged infringement or noncompliance, including
modifying our product code, stopping the distribution of some of our products, paying damages or releasing
the source code of our propriety software. Further, although we believe that we have complied with our
obligations under the licenses for such open source software, there is little legal precedent governing the
interpretation of some terms in some of these licenses, which increases the risk that a court could interpret
the licenses diﬀerently than we do.
Failure of our software products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments
could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business.
Certain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure IT infrastructures and
environments, and as a result, we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cyber-attacks. Open
source code or other third-party software used in these products could also be targeted and may make our
products vulnerable to additional security risks not posed by purely proprietary products. Our products are
complex and, when deployed, may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities, some of which may
not be discovered before the product has been released, installed and used by customers. The complexity
and breadth of our technical and production environments, which involve globally dispersed development
and engineering teams, increases the risk that errors, defects or vulnerabilities will be introduced and may
delay our ability to detect, mitigate or remediate such incidents.
In the past, elements of our proprietary source code have been exposed in an unauthorized manner. It
is possible that such exposure of source code could reveal unknown security vulnerabilities in our products
that could be exploited by malicious actors. Our products are also subject to known and unknown security
vulnerabilities resulting from integration with third-party products or services.
Although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents, we may be
unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be
undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers.
Additionally, eﬀorts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our
product licensing, or modiﬁcation of our software, which could cause us to lose existing or potential
customers.
A successful cyber-attack involving our products could cause customers and potential customers to
believe our services are ineﬀective or unreliable and result in, among other things, the loss of customers,
unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, diﬃculty in marketing our products, allegations by our
customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations and give rise to signiﬁcant costs,
including costs related to developing solutions or indemniﬁcation obligations under our agreements. Any
such event could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations. See also “An impairment of the
conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate
infrastructure vendors, could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business”.
Our sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties and governmental regulations,
which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business.
Our contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S. government
agencies are generally subject to annual ﬁscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at
the discretion of the government.
25
Table of Contents
Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely aﬀect our sales,
revenue and reputation. Additionally, our government contracts and our arrangements with channel
partners who may sell directly to government customers are generally subject to certain requirements,
some of which are generally not present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex, as well as to
audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal
actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion
of fees received, forfeiture of proﬁts, suspension of payments, ﬁnes and suspensions or debarment from
doing business with the government, which could materially adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial
condition, operating results and cash ﬂow.
Failure to eﬀectively manage our products and services lifecycles could harm our business.
As part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, customers are informed when products or
services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive
updates and security patches. If these products or services remain subject to a service contract, the
customer may transition to alternative products or services. Failure to eﬀectively manage our products and
services lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely
aﬀect our business and operating results.
Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual ﬂuctuations.
Our operating results have ﬂuctuated in the past and are likely to ﬂuctuate in the future. These
ﬂuctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which
are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section,
these factors include, among others:
•the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and
changes in end-user demand for our customers’ products;
•ﬂuctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers, which may
lead to increased requests to delay shipment of our products;
•the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may
adversely aﬀect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data
centers;
•the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of any terminations of
software contracts that require us to refund to customers any pre-paid amounts under the contract;
•our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies;
•the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product
revenue;
•new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;
•seasonality or other ﬂuctuations in demand in our markets;
•timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the
timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies; and
•timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties
and tariﬀs, and tax reform.
The foregoing factors are often diﬃcult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially
adversely aﬀect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a signiﬁcant amount of our operating
expenses are relatively ﬁxed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a
revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations.
As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not
be meaningful or reliable indicators of our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future
quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a signiﬁcant decline in the trading
price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.
Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological
changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing
practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue
to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product oﬀerings or as new competitors enter
our markets.
Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed
customer base, larger technical staﬀs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater
manufacturing, distribution, ﬁnancial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than
us. We also face competition from public cloud
26
Table of Contents
providers, numerous smaller companies that specialize in speciﬁc aspects of the highly fragmented
software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who oﬀer their
products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products.
In addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend
to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our
competitors may also receive ﬁnancial and other support from their home country government or may have
a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better
patent protection than us.
The actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a
substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well
as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new
and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete eﬀectively. If we are
unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur signiﬁcant reduction in
our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business and results of
operations.
Our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, price
erosion, acquisitions we may make, level of capacity utilization and commodity prices.
Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to seasonal and other
ﬂuctuations in our markets. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products, as well as the timing
and amount of our software licensing and non-product revenue, could adversely aﬀect our future gross
margin percentages. In addition, increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more
complex engineering requirements, lower demand, industry oversupply or reductions in our technological
lead compared to our competitors, and other factors have in the past and may in the future lead to further
price erosion, lower revenue and lower margin. Conversely, periods of robust demand that create a supply
imbalance can lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longer term.
In addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires signiﬁcant capital investment, leading to high ﬁxed
costs, including depreciation expense. If we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a
high level, the ﬁxed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher
average unit costs and a lower gross margin. Furthermore, we do not hedge our exposure to commodity
prices, some of which are very volatile, and sudden or prolonged increases in commodity prices may
adversely aﬀect our gross margin.
Our gross margin may also be adversely aﬀected if businesses or companies that we acquire have
diﬀerent gross margin proﬁles and by expenses related to such acquisitions.
We utilize a signiﬁcant amount of IP in our business. If we are unable or fail to protect our IP,
our business could be adversely aﬀected.
Our success depends in part upon protecting our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP
rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual
protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. We spend signiﬁcant resources to
monitor and protect our IP rights, including the unauthorized use of our products, usage rates of the
software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell, and even with signiﬁcant expenditures, we may not
be able to protect the IP rights that are valuable to our business. We are unable to predict or assure that:
•our IP rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or, in the case of third-party
IP rights licensed to us, be licensed to others;
•our IP rights will provide competitive advantages to us;
•rights previously granted by third parties to IP licensed or assigned to us, including portfolio cross-
licenses, will not hamper our ability to assert our IP rights or hinder the settlement of currently
pending or future disputes;
•any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the
coverage originally sought;
•our IP rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal
protection may be weak; or
•we have suﬃcient IP rights to protect our products or our business.
Eﬀective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those
protections available in the U.S., and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant
jurisdictions. In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they
provided to us.
27
Table of Contents
We also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements
relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to
assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In addition, we may
acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing
obligations may extend to our own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our
IP rights. From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against
our customers and suppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and
might deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties have and may in the
future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IP licensing business. An adverse decision
in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the value of our
technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect
royalty payments, which could otherwise negatively impact our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of
operations.
From time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew existing license agreements.
We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable
terms or at all.
We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.
From time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to signiﬁcant
expense. Our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemniﬁcation provisions, and in certain
cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues. The potential
liabilities associated with such provisions are signiﬁcant, and in some cases, including in agreements with
some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any
revenue we receive from the relevant products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in
connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely aﬀect
our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any
acquisition we may undertake in the future.
Product liability insurance is subject to signiﬁcant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such
insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure
with respect to certain matters. For example, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product
containing one of our semiconductor devices. In such an event, we may incur signiﬁcant costs and
expenses, including among others, replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and
reputational harm. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product
liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims.
Conversely, in some cases, amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular
claims and may need to be reversed.
The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected
defects or bugs, which could adversely aﬀect the market acceptance of new products, damage
our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely aﬀect our
operating costs.
Highly complex products, such as those we oﬀer, may contain defects and bugs when they are ﬁrst
introduced or as new versions, software documentation or enhancements are released, or their release may
be delayed due to unforeseen diﬃculties during product development. If any of our products or third-party
components used in our products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility
problems, we may not be able to successfully design workarounds. Furthermore, if any of these problems
are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of a new product,
we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs.
Signiﬁcant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and
deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third-
party software applications and databases. As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an actual or
perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer’s
system, it can be diﬃcult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the
failure of another supplier’s product. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be
reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely aﬀect our ability to retain existing
customers and attract new customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest signiﬁcant capital
and other resources and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the aﬀected
product or products. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others. For
example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s end-
product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to
compensate the customer for the adverse eﬀects of such delays. As a result, our ﬁnancial results could be
materially adversely aﬀected.
We make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments
could materially adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in
customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles and
evolving industry standards, and new
28
Table of Contents
delivery methods. In addition, semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line
width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could
impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to
make, signiﬁcant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced
products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new
competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products may
be reduced. Increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and
development eﬀorts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products,
which would have a negative impact on our ﬁnancial results.
We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy
and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to
comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.
We collect, use and store (collectively, “process”) a high volume, variety and velocity of certain
personal information in connection with the operation of our business. This creates various levels of privacy
risks across diﬀerent parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the jurisdiction
in question and the purpose of their processing. The personal information we process is subject to an
increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data
security, as well as contractual commitments. Privacy legislation and other data protection regulations,
enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a
complex regulatory compliance environment. Sectoral legislation, certiﬁcation requirements and technical
standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as those is the ﬁnancial services or public
sector, have exacerbated this trend. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related
and data governance measures could be signiﬁcant as they may create additional burdensome security,
business process, business record or data localization requirements. Concerns about government
interference, sovereignty, expanding privacy, cyber security and data governance legislation could
adversely aﬀect our customers and our products and services, particularly in cloud computing, artiﬁcial
intelligence and our own data management practices. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected,
used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in signiﬁcantly increased business and
security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us
to comply with privacy, data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental
enforcement actions, litigation, substantial ﬁnes and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust
in us, which could have an adverse eﬀect on our reputation and business.
We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs,
restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse eﬀect on
our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
We are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations relating to the use,
disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Compliance with environmental, health
and safety requirements could, among other things, require us to modify our manufacturing processes,
restrict our ability to expand our facilities, or require us to acquire pollution control equipment, all of which
can be very costly. Any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or
suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of
signiﬁcant ﬁnes and damages by us in the event of a signiﬁcant adverse judgment. In addition, complying
with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and
have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products, including
the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronic products sold in various countries,
including the U.S., China and Japan, and in the European Union, increase the complexity and costs of our
product design and procurement operations and may require us to re-engineer our products. Such re-
engineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse
eﬀect on our results of operations. We may also experience claims from employees from time to time with
regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims.
Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may adversely aﬀect our relationships
with customers and investors.
There is an increasing focus from lawmakers, regulators, investors, customers, employees and other
stakeholders concerning ESG matters, including environment, climate, diversity and inclusion, human rights
and governance transparency. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement
policies that include ESG provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may
seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing
number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose ESG-related policies, practices and metrics. In
addition, various jurisdictions are developing climate-related laws or regulations that could cause us to
incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers,
suppliers, or additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements,
as well as investor expectations on ESG practices and disclosures, are subject to change, can be
unpredictable, and may be diﬃcult and expensive for us to comply
29
Table of Contents
with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our outsourced manufacturing. Further, there is an
increasing number of state-level anti-ESG initiatives in the United States that may conﬂict with other
regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. If we fail to comply with or meet the
evolving legal and regulatory requirements or expectations of our various stakeholders, we may be subject
to enforcement actions, required to pay ﬁnes, customers may stop purchasing products from us or
investors may sell their shares, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. Our
actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives could negatively impact our reputation or
harm our business.
In addition, as part of their ESG programs, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source
products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals
are likely to be used to fund armed conﬂicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could
adversely aﬀect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor
devices, including our products. As a result, we may face diﬃculties in satisfying these customers’
demands, which may harm our sales and operating results.
The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased
rapidly and may do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross proﬁt.
The semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications. As a result, the
prices of those products have often decreased rapidly. Gross proﬁt on our products may be negatively
aﬀected by, among other things, pricing pressures from our customers. In the past, we have reduced the
average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product
introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. In addition, some of our customer agreements
provide for volume-based pricing and product pricing roadmaps, which can also reduce the average selling
prices of our products over time. Our margins and ﬁnancial results will suﬀer if we are unable to oﬀset any
reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing manufacturing costs, or
developing new and higher value-added products on a timely basis.
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses.
We operate global businesses and our consolidated ﬁnancial results are reported in U.S. dollars.
However, some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local
currencies. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar could result in substantial changes
in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of remeasuring these
transactions into U.S. dollars.
In the normal course of business, we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks,
including the use of derivative instruments. These strategies may not be eﬀective in protecting us against
the eﬀects of ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates. As a result, ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates
could result in ﬁnancial losses.
Risks Related to Our Taxes
Changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our ﬁnancial position and results
of operations.
Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in
many jurisdictions. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous
jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been, and will likely continue to
be, proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate.
After the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Reform Act”), most of our income
is taxable in the U.S. with a signiﬁcant portion taxable under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income
(“GILTI”) regime. Beginning in ﬁscal year 2027, the deduction allowable under the GILTI regime will
decrease from 50% to 37.5%, which will increase the eﬀective tax rate imposed on our income. The 2017
Tax Reform Act also limits our ability to deduct research and development expenses beginning in ﬁscal year
2023. These expenses are now capitalized and amortized over 5 years (15 years for foreign expenses),
which have and may continue to materially increase our cash tax costs. The U.S. also enacted the Inﬂation
Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) in August 2022, which created a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of
consolidated GAAP pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion. This
book minimum tax will ﬁrst apply to our ﬁscal year 2024 and any increase in our eﬀective tax rate or cash
tax will depend on a number of factors, including any oﬀsets for foreign tax credits or general business
credits, or changes in book income following business combinations. The IRA also created an excise tax of
1% of the value of our stock repurchased after December 31, 2022. While the impact of this excise tax has
not been material, it could increase materially depending on various factors, including the amount and
frequency of our stock repurchases, applicability to business combination transactions, and any permitted
reductions or exceptions to the amount subject to the tax. If (i) the U.S. tax rate increases, (ii) the
deduction allowable under the GILTI regime is further reduced or eliminated, or (iii) additional limitations
are put on our ability to deduct interest expense, our provision for income taxes, net income, and cash
ﬂows would be adversely impacted.
In addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international
tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and
Proﬁt Shifting recommendations and

action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-
border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also
continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of proﬁts among tax jurisdictions in
which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar
One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). Many countries have enacted or begun the process of enacting laws
based on Pillar Two proposals, which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and
cash ﬂows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments
and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative
investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings.
Any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance,
enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely aﬀect our business, the amount of
taxes we are required to pay and our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations generally.
If the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in
eﬀect or applicable for any reason, or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax
laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect, our corporate income taxes
could signiﬁcantly increase.
Our operations are currently structured to beneﬁt from the various tax incentives extended to us in
various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For example, absent our principal tax
incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, which is scheduled to expire in 2025, the
corporate income tax rate that would apply to our Singapore taxable income would be 17%. We also have a
tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in ﬁscal year 2028. Each tax
incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may,
in some instances, be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant
governmental authority. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any
particular tax incentive or tax holiday, we could, in some instances, be required to refund previously
realized material tax beneﬁts, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration
absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax beneﬁts earlier than scheduled. In addition, we
may be required, or elect, to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an
incentive, which could result in a decrease in the beneﬁts of the incentive. Our tax incentives could also be
adversely impacted if the global minimum tax provisions (Pillar Two) are adopted in a country in which we
have an existing tax incentive. Our tax incentives and tax holiday, before taking into consideration U.S.
foreign tax credits, decreased the provision for income taxes by approximately $2,104 million in the
aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by $4.93 for ﬁscal year 2023.
Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing
authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are
substantially modiﬁed or rescinded, we could suﬀer material adverse tax and other ﬁnancial consequences,
which would increase our expenses, reduce our proﬁtability and adversely aﬀect our cash ﬂows.
Our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are aﬀected by a number of factors that could
materially, adversely aﬀect ﬁnancial results.
Signiﬁcant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes. In the ordinary course of
our business, there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally,
our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations
of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to ﬁle tax returns. Although we believe
our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the ﬁnal determination of our income tax
liability will not be materially diﬀerent than what is reﬂected in our income tax provisions and accruals.
Our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely aﬀected by numerous factors
including:
•reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible assets, outstanding
indebtedness and corporate structure, including business combinations;
•jurisdictional mix of our income and assets;
•changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments related to changes in our
corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law;
•changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. income generated from foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses
attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules;
•tax eﬀects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and
•changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
liabilities.

Table of Contents
We have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services, the sale of products, the
arrangement of ﬁnancing and the grant of licenses from one aﬃliate to another at prices that we believe
are negotiated on an arm’s length basis. Our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local
authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm’s length basis.
Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack
of comprehensive treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful,
result in adjustments for prior or future years. The eﬀects of any such changes could subject us to higher
taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash ﬂow would be adversely aﬀected.
Further, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may
assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the ﬁnal
determination of tax audits could be materially diﬀerent from our income tax provisions and accruals. The
ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse eﬀect on our results of operations and cash ﬂows
in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
As a result of the VMware Merger, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions for the Dell
consolidated group, of which VMware was a member beginning in Dell’s ﬁscal year 2017 until November
2021. While VMware is no longer a member of the Dell consolidated group, it is still subject to audit for the
periods in which it was member of the Dell consolidated group. While we believe VMware’s positions are
reasonable, the ﬁnal determination of tax audits could be materially diﬀerent from our income tax
provisions and accruals. Further, pursuant to a tax agreement VMware and Dell, in the event VMware
becomes subject to audits as a member of Dell’s consolidated group, Dell has authority to control the audit
and represent Dell and our interests, could limit our ability to aﬀect the outcome of such audits.
We have potential tax liabilities as a result of VMware’s former controlling ownership by Dell,
which could have an adverse eﬀect on our ﬁnancial condition and operating results.
If the VMware spin-oﬀ from Dell in November 2021 is determined to not be tax-free for any reason, we
could be liable for all or a portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our
ﬁnancial condition and operating results. Further, if the VMware Merger results in the spin-oﬀ failing to
qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, Dell, its aﬃliates and,
potentially, its stockholders would incur signiﬁcant tax liabilities and we may be required to indemnify Dell
and its aﬃliates for any such tax liabilities, which could be material.
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely aﬀect our ﬁnancial health and our ability to
execute our business strategy.
As of October 29, 2023, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was $40,815 million.
Subsequent to the end of ﬁscal year 2023, we borrowed $30,390 million in term loans to ﬁnance the
VMware Merger (the “2023 Term Loans”), and we assumed $8,250 million of VMware’s outstanding senior
unsecured notes.
Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:
•increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;
•exposing us to interest rate risk as our 2023 Term Loans bear ﬂoating interest rates, which we do
not typically hedge against;
•limiting our ﬂexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor
industry;
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;
•making it more diﬃcult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working
capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and
•potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash ﬂow from operations to
payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash ﬂow to fund our other
business needs.
We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact our
credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production
growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels
could also be considered by the rating agencies. While we are focused on maintaining investment grade
ratings from these agencies, we may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings
of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:
•adversely aﬀect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities;
•increase interest expense under our term facilities;
•increase the cost of, and adversely aﬀect our ability to reﬁnance, our existing debt; and
•adversely aﬀect our ability to raise additional debt.

Table of Contents
The instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business.
The instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our
business. These restrictions may aﬀect our ability to operate our business, to plan for, or react to, changes
in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential
business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest
coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt, enter into certain sale and lease-
back transactions and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.
In addition, the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any
applicable grace period, the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. In such event,
we may not have suﬃcient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to
reﬁnance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely aﬀect our
business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Servicing our debt requires a signiﬁcant amount of cash, and we may not have suﬃcient cash
ﬂow from our business to pay our substantial debt.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, and to reﬁnance our
debt, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, ﬁnancial, competitive and other
factors. Our business may not continue to generate cash ﬂow from operations in the future suﬃcient to
satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to
make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash ﬂow, we may be required to
adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling
assets, reﬁnancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.
Our ability to reﬁnance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital
markets and our ﬁnancial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or
engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed, which could result in a default on our
indebtedness.
Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock
At times, our stock price has been volatile and it may ﬂuctuate substantially in the future,
which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation
against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our
management’s attention and resources.
The trading price of our common stock has, at times, ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly and could be subject to
wide ﬂuctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “Risk Factors” section, and others,
including:
•issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts;
•ﬂuctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our signiﬁcant customers as well as
companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;
•announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;
•announcements of, or expectations of, additional debt or equity ﬁnancing transactions;
•stock price and volume ﬂuctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our
common stock;
•hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock; and
•unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business.
These ﬂuctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Broad market
and industry ﬂuctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions,
interest rate changes or currency ﬂuctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common
stock. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your
investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have
been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future.
In addition, we have been, and in the future we may be, subject to lawsuits stemming from our
acquisitions, including the VMware Merger. Securities litigation against us, including the lawsuits related to
such acquisitions, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other
business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.
The amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may ﬂuctuate.
The amount, timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may ﬂuctuate based on our
priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. These purposes include operational spending, capital
spending, acquisitions, repayment of debt and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments.
Changes in cash ﬂows, tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock repurchase program. We
are not obligated to repurchase any speciﬁc amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase
program may be suspended or terminated at any time.

Table of Contents
A substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and signiﬁcant
sales of our common stock by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall.
As of September 29, 2023, we believe 10 of our 20 largest holders of common stock were active
institutional investors who held 23% of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate. These
investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market
price of our common stock. In addition, any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also
impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash
dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject
to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time.
Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or
limitations on our ability to obtain suﬃcient funds through dividends from subsidiaries. There can be no
assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to
$10 billion of our common stock from time to time through December 31, 2022, which was subsequently
extended to December 31, 2023. In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase
program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from time to time through
December 31, 2023 (“May 2022 Authorization”). We repurchased and retired approximately 9 million and
12 million shares of our common stock for $5,824 million and $7,000 million under these stock repurchase
programs during ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be eﬀected through a variety of methods,
including open market or privately negotiated purchases. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will
depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements,
alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. We are not obligated to
repurchase any speciﬁc amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be

Commission (the “SEC”) on December 16, 2022.
Overview
We are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor
and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital
and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based
products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and oﬀer thousands of products
that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top
boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center
servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and
electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate,
manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. Our portfolio of
infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex
hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also oﬀer
mission critical ﬁbre channel storage area networking (“FC SAN”) products and related software in the form
of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.
We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Our
semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our product lines and intellectual property (“IP”) licensing.
Our infrastructure software segment includes our mainframe, distributed and cyber security solutions, and
our FC SAN business.
Our strategy is to combine best-of-breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure
software solutions, with unmatched scale, on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a
comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading business and government
customers. We seek to achieve this through responsibly ﬁnanced acquisitions of category-leading
businesses and technologies, as well as investing extensively in research and development, to ensure our
products retain their technology leadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to
drive diversiﬁed and sustainable operating and ﬁnancial results.
The demand for our products has been aﬀected in the past, and is likely to continue to be aﬀected in
the future, by various factors, including the following:
•gain or loss of signiﬁcant customers;
•general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete;
•our distributors’ product inventory and end customer demand;
•the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and
technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our
technology are accepted in their markets; 
•the shift to cloud-based information technology solutions and services, such as hyperscale
computing, which may adversely aﬀect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in
traditional enterprise data centers; and
•the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders.
Fiscal Year Highlights
Highlights during ﬁscal year 2023 include the following:
•We generated $18,085 million of cash from operations.
•We paid $7,645 million in cash dividends.
•We repurchased $5,824 million of common stock.

Acquisition of VMware, Inc.
On November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the
“VMware Merger”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the eﬀective time of the VMware Merger was indirectly
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock,
either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder
election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive
cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock,
in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and
outstanding. Based on the VMware stockholders’ elections, the VMware stockholders received
approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 54.4 million shares of Broadcom common stock in aggregate.
We assumed all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards and performance stock unit
awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards were converted into approximately 5 million
Broadcom RSU awards. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-
employee directors were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom
common stock, in equal parts.
VMware was a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation
with enterprise control. We acquired VMware to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities.
The preliminary purchase consideration for the VMware Merger was approximately $86.3 billion. We
funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term
loans under a credit agreement that we entered into on August 15, 2023 (the “2023 Credit Agreement”), as
well as cash on hand. See Note 15. “Subsequent Events” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information.
The discussions below related to our business and ﬁnancial results for ﬁscal year 2023 and prior
periods do not include any impact from or information relating to the VMware Merger.
Net Revenue
A majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are
incorporated into electronic products, as well as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is
also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop, automate,
manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms.
Our overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our
semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due
largely to ﬂuctuations in end-market demand, including the eﬀects of seasonality, which are discussed in
detail in Part I, Item 1. Business under “Seasonality” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Distributors and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), or their contract manufacturers, typically
account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we
have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors,
complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective
product ranges. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple
target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized
product and service knowledge that enables us to sell speciﬁc oﬀerings at key levels throughout a
customer’s organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with speciﬁed
intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in
place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has
enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’
requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key
insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more eﬃcient and productive and to
better serve our target markets and customers. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to
the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. Such revenue is
reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances.
Our software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from
multiple vendors and are highly complex. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to
oﬀer our customers reduced complexity, more ﬂexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive
revenue growth.
Costs and Expenses
Cost of products sold.  Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers
and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such
costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stock-based
compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality,
order fulﬁllment, warranty adjustments, inventory adjustments
38
Table of Contents
including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, and acquisition costs, which include direct transaction
costs and acquisition-related costs.
Although we outsource a signiﬁcant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some
proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at
a desired level, the ﬁxed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher
average unit costs and lower gross margins.
Cost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project
costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and
allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation
expense.
Total cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and
restructuring charges.
Research and development.  Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs
for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including
stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees
paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate
expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and
design process.
Selling, general and administrative.  Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated
costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions
paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing,
promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs,
and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and
associated costs for executive management, ﬁnance, human resources and other administrative personnel,
including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs,
acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.  In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize
intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill,
which is not amortized, and in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), which is initially capitalized as
an indeﬁnite-lived intangible asset, in connection with the acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying
project, IPR&D assets are reclassiﬁed as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their
estimated useful lives.
Restructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring
charges related to IP litigation, compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of
our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, facility and lease
abandonments, ﬁxed asset impairment, IPR&D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of
service or supply agreements.
Interest expense.  Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original
issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs, and expenses related to debt
modiﬁcations or extinguishments.
Other income (expense), net.  Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains or losses on
investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.
Provision for income taxes.  We have structured our operations to maximize the beneﬁt from tax
incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax
incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in
Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance
with the conditions speciﬁed in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax
incentives are presently expected to expire in November 2025. The corporate income tax rate in Singapore
that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday from our qualifying income
earned in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in 2028.
Each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other
conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with any such operating conditions speciﬁed, we could, in
some instances, be required to refund previously realized material tax beneﬁts, or if such tax incentive or
tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax
beneﬁts earlier than scheduled. We may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which
may not be as beneﬁcial to us as the beneﬁts provided under the present tax concession arrangements.
Before taking into consideration the eﬀects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts,
the eﬀect of these tax incentives and tax holiday decreased the provision for income taxes by
approximately $2,104 million and $1,821 million for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing
authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are
substantially modiﬁed or rescinded, we could suﬀer material adverse tax and other ﬁnancial consequences,
which would increase our expenses, reduce our proﬁtability and
39
Table of Contents
adversely aﬀect our cash ﬂows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon
acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being
on an arm’s length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing
authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax
authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We
base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual ﬁnancial results may diﬀer materially and adversely
from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that aﬀect our ﬁnancial statements materially
and involve diﬃcult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue
recognition, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes. See Note 2. “Summary of
Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies” included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
information on our critical accounting policies and estimates.
Revenue recognition.  We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the
contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identiﬁed,
payment terms can be identiﬁed, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect
substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance
obligations are satisﬁed by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Our
products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services.
We recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers
to the customer. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our
estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms.
To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made
based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a
risk that there could be signiﬁcant diﬀerences between actual amounts and our estimates. Diﬀerent
judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be signiﬁcant to reported operating results. We
also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We
accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts
as speciﬁc rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer
subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive
impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods.
Valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets.  We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill
during the fourth ﬁscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment
exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires
signiﬁcant judgment. To review for impairment, we ﬁrst assess qualitative factors to determine whether
events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of
our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of
goodwill, whether performed annually or based on speciﬁc events or circumstances, considers various
macroeconomic, industry-speciﬁc and company-speciﬁc factors. These factors include: (i) severe adverse
industry or economic trends; (ii) signiﬁcant company-speciﬁc actions, including exiting an activity in
conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our
ﬁnancial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value.
After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not
that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is
performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is
less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value
to the reporting unit’s net book value.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of signiﬁcant estimates and
assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to
estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income approach is based on the discounted cash ﬂow method
that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future ﬁnancial performance, including revenues,
operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates
are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates
and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal
estimates. Projected cash ﬂows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that
properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to
the subject cash ﬂows. The market approach is based on weighting the ﬁnancial multiples of comparable
companies and applying a control premium. A reporting unit's
40
Table of Contents
carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate
assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.
We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased IPR&D, property, plant and
equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important
which could trigger an impairment review include: (i) signiﬁcant under-performance relative to historical or
projected future operating results, (ii) signiﬁcant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or
the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) signiﬁcant negative industry or economic trends. The process of
evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant
and equipment, and intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires signiﬁcant judgment. In order to
estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future
prospects of our business or the part of our business to which the long-lived assets relate. We also consider
market factors speciﬁc to the business and estimate future cash ﬂows to be generated by the business,
which requires signiﬁcant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products
over a number of future years. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need
to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived assets stated on our consolidated
balance sheets to reﬂect their estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and
remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be aﬀected by a variety of factors,
including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal
factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the
assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in
assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported ﬁnancial results.
Income taxes. Signiﬁcant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or beneﬁt
from income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation
allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future
taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for
valuation allowances. An adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our
provision for or beneﬁt from income taxes in the period such determination is made. In evaluating the
exposure associated with various tax ﬁling positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions
do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex
tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes, interest, and penalties will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to
be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If
the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities
would result in tax beneﬁts being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist.
Fiscal Year Presentation
We operate on a 52- or 53-week ﬁscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week
year and the ﬁrst Sunday in November in a 53-week year. Our ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 each
consisted of 52 weeks.
The ﬁnancial statements included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in
accordance with GAAP and expressed in U.S. dollars.

Net Revenue
A relatively small number of customers account for a signiﬁcant portion of our net revenue. Sales of
products to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of our net revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022,
respectively. Direct sales to WT Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a distributor, accounted for 21% and 20% of our
net revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top ﬁve end
customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal
years 2023 and 2022. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for
approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We expect to continue to
experience signiﬁcant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or signiﬁcant decrease in
demand from, any of our top ﬁve end customers could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business,
results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
From time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders,
causing our quarterly net revenue to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. This is particularly true of our wireless products
as ﬂuctuations may be magniﬁed by the timing of launches, and seasonal variations in sales, of mobile
devices. In addition, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and may cause our net revenue to
ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly and impact our results of operations.
Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in
Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by country based primarily on the geographic shipment or
delivery location speciﬁed by our distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software
customers. In ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, 32% and 35%, respectively, of our net revenue came from
shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong Kong). However, the end customers for either our products
or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other
than China (including Hong Kong). As a result, we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net
revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our
product, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong).

Infrastructure software 21  22 
Total net revenue 100 % 100 %
Net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to strong product demand,
primarily for networking, server storage and broadband products. Net revenue from our infrastructure
software segment increased primarily due to increases in sales from our mainframe solutions, partially
oﬀset by lower demand for our FC SAN products.
Gross Margin
Gross margin was $24,690 million, or 69% of net revenue, for ﬁscal year 2023, compared to $22,095
million, or 67% of net revenue, for ﬁscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to lower amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets, mainly from our 2016 acquisition of Broadcom Corporation, partially
oﬀset by less favorable margin within our semiconductor solutions segment driven by product mix. We
expect to incur additional amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in future periods as a result
of the VMware Merger and any further acquisitions we may make.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense increased $334 million, or 7%, in ﬁscal year 2023, compared to
the prior ﬁscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense as a
result of annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values in ﬁscal year 2023,
partially oﬀset by lower variable employee compensation expense. We expect to incur additional research
and development expense in future periods as a result of the VMware Merger and any further acquisitions
we may make.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $210 million, or 15%, in ﬁscal year 2023,
compared to the prior ﬁscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher costs incurred in connection
with the VMware Merger and higher stock-based compensation expense as a result of annual employee
equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values in ﬁscal year 2023, partially oﬀset by lower variable
employee compensation expense.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased $118
million, or 8%, in ﬁscal year 2023, compared to the prior ﬁscal year. The decrease was primarily due to
lower amortization of customer-related intangible assets from our acquisition of LSI Corporation. We expect
to incur additional amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in future periods as a result of the
VMware Merger and any further acquisitions we may make.
Restructuring and Other Charges
Restructuring and other charges in ﬁscal year 2023 primarily included non-recurring charges related to
IP litigation. We expect to incur additional restructuring and other charges in future periods as a result of
the VMware Merger and any further acquisitions we may make.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Total stock-based compensation expense was $2,171 million and $1,533 million for ﬁscal years 2023
and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to annual employee equity awards granted at
higher grant-date fair values in ﬁscal year 2023. We expect to incur additional stock-based compensation
expense in future periods as a result of the VMware Merger and any further acquisitions we may make.

During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal year ended November 3, 2019 (“ﬁscal year 2019”), our Compensation
Committee approved a broad-based program of multi-year equity grants of time- and market-based RSUs
(the “Multi-Year Equity Awards”) in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on March
15 of each year. Each Multi-Year Equity Award vests on the same basis as four annual grants made on
March 15 of each year, beginning in ﬁscal year 2019, with successive four-year vesting periods. We
recognize stock-based compensation expense related to the Multi-Year Equity Awards from the grant date
through their respective vesting date, ranging from 4 years to 7 years.

Total operating income $ 16,207 $ 14,225 $ 1,982  14 %
Operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased primarily due to higher net
revenue from networking, server storage, and broadband products. Operating income from our
infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher net revenue from our mainframe
solutions, partially oﬀset by lower net revenue from our FC SAN products.
Unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; stock-based
compensation expense; restructuring and other charges; acquisition-related costs; and other costs that are
not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses
decreased 2% in ﬁscal year 2023, compared to the prior ﬁscal year, primarily due to lower amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially oﬀset by higher stock-based compensation expense,
non-recurring charges related to IP litigation, and acquisition-related costs.
Non-Operating Income and Expenses
Interest expense. Interest expense was $1,622 million and $1,737 million for ﬁscal years 2023 and
2022, respectively. The decrease was due to losses on extinguishment of debt related to debt transactions
incurred in ﬁscal year 2022. We expect to incur additional interest expense in future periods as a result of
indebtedness associated with the VMware Merger.
Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains or losses on
investments, foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items. Other income, net, was $512
million for ﬁscal year 2023, compared to other expense, net, of $54 million for ﬁscal year 2022. The change
was primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates and changes in investment
gains or losses.
Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was $1,015 million and $939 million for
ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher income before income
taxes, partially oﬀset by an increase in the recognition of uncertain tax beneﬁts as a result of lapses of
statutes of limitations.

Table of Contents
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary
liquidity requirements and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid
investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash
equivalents are liquid and accessible.
Our primary sources of liquidity as of October 29, 2023 consisted of: (i) $14,189 million in cash and
cash equivalents, (ii) cash we expect to generate from operations and (iii) available capacity under our $7.5
billion unsecured revolving credit facility. In addition, we may also generate cash from the sale of assets
and debt or equity ﬁnancings from time to time.
Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and
investments we may make from time to time, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and
development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our
Board of Directors), (v) interest and principal payments related to our $40,815 million of outstanding
indebtedness, (vi) share repurchases, and (vii) payment of income taxes. Our ability to fund these
requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash ﬂows, which are determined by our future operating
performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and ﬁnancial, business
and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in
ﬁscal year 2024 as compared to ﬁscal year 2023. Our debt and liquidity needs increased as a result of
completing the VMware Merger. We funded the cash portion of the consideration with net proceeds from
the issuance of $30,390 million in term loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement, as well as cash on hand.
We also assumed $8,250 million of VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash ﬂows from operations, and the revolving
credit facility will provide suﬃcient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed
obligations for at least the next 12 months. For additional information regarding our cash requirement from
contractual obligations, indebtedness and lease obligations, see Note 13. “Commitments and
Contingencies”, Note 9. “Borrowings” and Note 5. “Leases” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.
From time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or
investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential
transactions, could require signiﬁcant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our
borrowings to fund such transactions. If we do not have suﬃcient cash to fund our operations or ﬁnance
growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and
ﬁnancial condition could suﬀer. In such circumstances, we may seek to obtain new debt or equity ﬁnancing.
However, we cannot assure you that such additional ﬁnancing will be available on terms acceptable to us or
at all. Our ability to service our senior unsecured notes, the term loans we issued to fund the VMware
Merger, and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.
We may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those speciﬁed above.
In addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt
through cash tenders and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions or otherwise. Such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at
such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Working Capital
Working capital increased to $13,442 million at October 29, 2023 from $11,452 million at October 30,
2022. The increase was attributable to the following:
•Cash and cash equivalents increased to $14,189 million at October 29, 2023 from $12,416 million at
October 30, 2022, primarily due to $18,085 million in net cash provided by operating activities,
partially oﬀset by $7,645 million of dividend payments, $5,824 million of common stock
repurchases, and $1,861 million of employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity
awards.
•Other current liabilities decreased to $3,652 million at October 29, 2023 from $4,412 million at
October 30, 2022, primarily due to decreases in contract liabilities and income taxes payable.
•Other current assets increased to $1,606 million at October 29, 2023 from $1,205 million at
October 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in contract assets, oﬀset in part by a decrease in
prepaid income taxes.
•Employee compensation and beneﬁts decreased to $935 million at October 29, 2023 from $1,202
million at October 30, 2022, primarily due to lower variable compensation.
•Accounts receivable increased to $3,154 million at October 29, 2023 from $2,958 million at
October 30, 2022, primarily due to revenue linearity, oﬀset in part by additional receivables sold
through factoring arrangements.

Table of Contents
These increases in working capital were oﬀset in part by the following:
•Current portion of long-term debt increased to $1,608 million at October 29, 2023 from $440 million
at October 30, 2022, primarily due to certain debt instruments becoming due within the next twelve
months, oﬀset in part by repayments.
•Accounts payable increased to $1,210 million at October 29, 2023 from $998 million at October 30,
2022, primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.

$10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or prior to December 31, 2022, which was
subsequently extended through December 31, 2023. In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized
another stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from
time to time through December 31, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, $7,176 million of the authorized amount
remained available for repurchases.
During ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, we repurchased and retired approximately 9 million and 12 million
shares of our common stock for $5,824 million and $7,000 million, respectively, under these stock
repurchase programs.
Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be eﬀected through a variety of methods,
including open market or privately negotiated purchases. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will
depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements,
alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. We are not obligated to
repurchase any speciﬁc amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be
suspended or terminated at any time.
During ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, we paid approximately $1,861 million and $1,455 million,
respectively, in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. We withheld
approximately 3 million shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share
settlements during each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022.

Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,773 $ 253 
Operating Activities
Cash ﬂows from operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash and other
items and changes in assets and liabilities. The $1,349 million increase in cash provided by operations
during ﬁscal year 2023 compared to ﬁscal year 2022 was due to $2,587 million higher net income, oﬀset in
part by $1,249 million lower non-cash adjustments primarily from lower amortization of intangible assets.

Table of Contents
Investing Activities
Cash ﬂows from investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures, sales and purchases of
investments, and cash used for acquisitions. The $22 million increase in cash used in investing activities for
ﬁscal year 2023 compared to ﬁscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $118 million increase in purchases of
investments, net of proceeds from sales of investments, oﬀset by a $193 million decrease in cash paid for
acquisitions.
Financing Activities
Cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities primarily consisted of dividend payments, stock repurchases,
proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings, and employee withholding tax payments
related to net settled equity awards. The $193 million decrease in cash used in ﬁnancing activities for ﬁscal
year 2023 compared to ﬁscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $1,958 million decrease in payments on
debt obligations and a $1,176 million decrease in stock repurchases, oﬀset by a $1,935 million decrease in
proceeds from long-term borrowings, a $613 million increase in dividend payments and a $406 million
increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards.
ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
From time to time, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures to
changes in currency exchange rates, which result from our global operating and ﬁnancing activities. We do
not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Neither gains and losses from
foreign currency transactions nor foreign exchange forward contracts were signiﬁcant for any period
presented in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in this Form 10-K. We did not have any
outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of October 29, 2023 or October 30, 2022.
Interest Rate Risk
Changes in interest rates aﬀect the fair value of our outstanding debt. As of October 29, 2023 and
October 30, 2022, we had $40.8 billion and $41.2 billion in principal amount of debt outstanding, and the
estimated aggregate fair value of debt was $33.2 billion and $33.0 billion, respectively. As of October 29,
2023 and October 30, 2022, a hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates
would change the fair value of debt by a decrease or increase of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion,
respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on
our debt as we only had ﬁxed rate senior notes outstanding. To hedge variability of cash ﬂows due to
changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances, we have entered, and in the
future may enter, into treasury rate lock contracts.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Broadcom Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadcom Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash ﬂows for each of the three years
in the period ended October 29, 2023, including the related notes and ﬁnancial statement schedule listed in
the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated ﬁnancial
statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of
October 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the ﬁnancial position of the Company as of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, and the
results of its operations and its cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended October 29, 2023
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, eﬀective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting
as of October 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated ﬁnancial statements, for maintaining
eﬀective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, and for its assessment of the eﬀectiveness of internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s
consolidated ﬁnancial statements and on the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on
our audits. We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether eﬀective internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Our audit of internal control
over ﬁnancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
eﬀectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
Deﬁnition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material eﬀect on the ﬁnancial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of eﬀectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing
a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Uncertain Tax Positions (UTPs)
As described in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the gross unrecognized tax
beneﬁts balance was $4,655 million as of October 29, 2023. As management has disclosed, management
evaluates the exposure associated with various tax ﬁling positions and accrues an income tax liability when
such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition. A tax beneﬁt from an UTP
may be recognized when it is more-likely-than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the UTPs is a
critical audit matter are (i) the signiﬁcant judgment by management when evaluating the technical merits
of these tax positions, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and eﬀort in performing
procedures and evaluating the technical merits of the tax positions, and (iii) the audit eﬀort involved the
use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with
forming our overall opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. These procedures included testing the
eﬀectiveness of controls relating to the identiﬁcation and recognition of the income tax liability for UTPs,
including controls addressing the completeness of the UTPs and the measurement of the income tax
liability. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for identifying
potential new UTPs, (ii) for a selection of UTPs, evaluating possible outcomes, and (iii) for a selection of
UTPs, testing the calculation of the income tax liability, including management’s assessment of the
technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax beneﬁt expected to be sustained.
Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in (i) the evaluation of the
completeness of management’s identiﬁcation of the UTPs and (ii) for a selection of UTPs, the evaluation of
the reasonableness of management’s assessment of whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of
being sustained, the amount of potential beneﬁt to be realized, and the application of relevant tax laws.

have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. See Note 12.
“Segment Information” for additional information.
Basis of Presentation
We operate on a 52- or 53-week ﬁscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week
year and the ﬁrst Sunday in November in a 53-week year. Our ﬁscal year ended October 29, 2023 (“ﬁscal
year 2023”) was a 52-week ﬁscal year. The ﬁrst quarter of our ﬁscal year 2023 ended on January 29, 2023,
the second quarter ended on April 30, 2023 and the third quarter ended on July 30, 2023. Our ﬁscal year
ended October 30, 2022 (“ﬁscal year 2022”) and ﬁscal year ended October 31, 2021 (“ﬁscal year 2021”)
were both 52-week ﬁscal years.
The accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its
subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
2. Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
Foreign currency remeasurement.  We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current
exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured
and recorded at historical exchange rates. The eﬀects of foreign currency remeasurement were not
material for any period presented.
Use of estimates.  The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could diﬀer materially from
these estimates, and such diﬀerences could aﬀect the results of operations reported in future periods.
Cash and cash equivalents.  We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities
of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate
classiﬁcation of our cash and cash equivalents at the time of purchase.
Trade accounts receivable, net.  Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and
do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our
best estimate of the expected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the
allowance based on historical experience and current economic conditions, among other factors.
Allowances for doubtful accounts were not material as of October 29, 2023 or October 30, 2022. Accounts
receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and distributor credit allowances. These amounts are
recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted or products will be
returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of October 29, 2023 and
October 30, 2022 were $137 million and $126 million, respectively.
Concentrations of credit risk and signiﬁcant customers.  Our cash, cash equivalents and accounts
receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents may be
redeemable upon demand and are maintained with ﬁnancial institutions that management believes are of
high credit quality and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading
such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk proﬁle
55
Table of Contents
of these counterparties. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located
both within and outside the U.S. We mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular
credit evaluations of our customers’ ﬁnancial conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and
bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.
Concentration of other risks.  We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Signiﬁcant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products with
new capabilities, general economic conditions worldwide, the ability to safeguard patents and other
intellectual property (“IP”) in a rapidly evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractors,
third-party wafer fabricators and independent distributors and other factors could aﬀect our ﬁnancial
results.
Inventory.  We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory,
with cost being determined under the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out method. We record a provision for excess and
obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. The
excess and obsolete balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess and obsolete
inventory charge and the written-down value of the inventory becomes its new cost basis.
Retirement beneﬁt plans. For deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans, we consider various factors in determining
our respective beneﬁt obligations and net periodic beneﬁt cost, including the number of employees that we
expect to receive beneﬁts, their salary levels and years of service, the expected return on plan assets, the
discount rate, the timing of the payment of beneﬁts, and other actuarial assumptions. If the actual results
and events of the beneﬁt plans diﬀer from our current assumptions, the beneﬁt obligations may be over- or
under-valued.
The key assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The U.S.
discount rates are based on a hypothetical yield curve constructed using high-quality corporate bonds
selected to yield cash ﬂows that match the expected timing and amount of the beneﬁt payments. The U.S.
expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our
fully-matched, liability-driven investment strategy. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. For the
non-U.S. plans, we set assumptions speciﬁc to each country. We have elected to measure deﬁned beneﬁt
pension plan assets and liabilities as of October 31, which is the month end that is closest to our ﬁscal year
end.
Derivative instruments.  We use derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage exposure to foreign
exchange risk and interest rate risk. We do not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative or
trading purposes.
Outstanding derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at their fair values based on Level 2
inputs, as deﬁned in the fair value hierarchy. For derivative instruments designated as cash ﬂow hedges,
the changes in fair value are initially recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in the
period of change, and are subsequently reclassiﬁed and recognized in the same line item as the hedged
item when either the hedged transactions aﬀect earnings or it becomes probable that the hedged
transactions will not occur.
We use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These
forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and the changes in fair value are recognized
in other income (expense), net in the period of change. We did not have any outstanding foreign exchange
forward contracts as of October 29, 2023 or October 30, 2022. The gains and losses recorded in other
income (expense), net for derivative instruments not designated as hedges were not material.
During ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, we entered into treasury rate lock contracts that mature in
approximately one year to hedge variability of cash ﬂows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of
anticipated future debt issuances. These treasury rate locks were designated and accounted for as cash
ﬂow hedging instruments. As of October 30, 2022, the total notional amount of these contracts was
$1.3 billion, and the fair value of these contracts was $47 million, which was recorded as a derivative asset
with the gains recorded net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on our
consolidated balance sheet. In August 2023, we early settled all treasury rate lock contracts, which had a
$5.5 billion notional amount, for a cumulative gain of $371 million, which was recorded net of tax as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income as of October 29, 2023. The cumulative gain will
be amortized to interest expense associated with future debt to be issued referencing the respective
hedged treasury rates. The cash receipts were included in cash ﬂows from operating activities in the
consolidated statements of cash ﬂows. No derivative instruments that hedge interest rate risk were
outstanding as of October 29, 2023.
Property, plant and equipment.  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized, and
maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Assets are held in construction in
progress until placed in service, upon which date, we begin to depreciate these assets. When assets are
retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from
our property, plant and equipment balances and the resulting gain or loss is reﬂected in the consolidated
statements of operations. Buildings and leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over 15 to
40 years,
56
Table of Contents
or over the lease period, whichever is shorter, and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated
over 3 to 10 years. We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.
Leases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the
arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a ﬁnance lease at the
commencement date. We recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for operating and
ﬁnance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and account for the lease and non-lease components as
a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities
represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and ﬁnance lease ROU assets and liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease
commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incremental
borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The
incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the eﬀects of collateral.
Operating and ﬁnance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will
exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance lease expense is recognized based on the eﬀective-interest method over the lease term.
Fair value measurement.  Fair value is deﬁned as the price that would be received upon sale of an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance on fair value measurements are
described below:
Level 1 — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets
include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We
measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in
active markets with suﬃcient volume and frequency of transactions.
Level 2 — Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a speciﬁed
contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 — Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any,
market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include
investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and
property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash ﬂow approach
when they are impaired. Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each
reporting period includes indicators of signiﬁcant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating,
asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and ﬁnancial indicators of the investee's ability to
continue as a going concern.
Business combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of
accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed at their acquisition date fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to
accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent
consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to reﬁnement. As a
result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record
adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding oﬀset to goodwill. Upon
the conclusion of the measurement period or ﬁnal determination of the values of assets acquired or
liabilities assumed, whichever comes ﬁrst, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated
statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make
signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for
intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies,
and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we
have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical
experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently
uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets under the income approach
include growth in future expected cash ﬂows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired
technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology obsolescence rates, expected
costs to develop in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) into commercially viable products,
estimated cash ﬂows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and
circumstances may occur which could aﬀect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or
actual results.

Goodwill.  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned
to the net tangible and identiﬁable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but
is reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. To review for
impairment we ﬁrst assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a
determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its
carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually
or based on speciﬁc events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-speciﬁc and
company-speciﬁc factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends;
(ii) signiﬁcant company-speciﬁc actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of
operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our ﬁnancial performance; or (iv) a sustained
decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and
circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting
units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate
the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net book value, there is no impairment. Otherwise, we
calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets,
excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value of
goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the
carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the diﬀerence. Determining the fair
value of a reporting unit involves the use of signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions.
Long-lived assets. Purchased ﬁnite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization is recognized over the periods during which the intangible assets are expected
to contribute to our cash ﬂows. Purchased IPR&D projects are capitalized at fair value as an indeﬁnite-lived
intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter. Upon completion of each underlying project,
IPR&D assets are reclassiﬁed as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their
estimated useful lives. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we recognize the carrying value of the related
intangible asset in our consolidated statements of operations in the period it is abandoned. On a quarterly
basis, we monitor factors and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived
assets, including purchased intangible assets, ROU assets, and property, plant and equipment, may not be
recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include: (i) signiﬁcant
under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) signiﬁcant changes in the
manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, and (iii) signiﬁcant
negative industry or economic trends. An impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected
future cash ﬂows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (or
asset group) is less than the net book value of the asset (or asset group). The amount of the impairment
loss will generally be measured as the diﬀerence between the net book value of the asset (or asset group)
and the estimated fair value.
Warranty.  We accrue for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
Product warranty costs are estimated based upon our historical experience and speciﬁc identiﬁcation of the
product requirements, which may ﬂuctuate based on product mix. Additionally, we accrue for warranty
costs associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a loss is probable and can be
reasonably estimated.
Revenue recognition.  We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the
contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identiﬁed,
payment terms can be identiﬁed, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect
substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance
obligations are satisﬁed by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.
Nature of Products and Services
Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and
services. The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue.
Products. We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers
to the customer. Rebates and incentives oﬀered to distributors, which are earned when sales to end
customers are completed, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition. We have elected to exclude
from the transaction price any taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling
activities performed after a customer obtains control of the product as activities to fulﬁll the promise to
transfer the product. From time to time, certain customers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange
for prioritized fulﬁllment of product orders. Such fees are included in the transaction price of the product
orders and are recognized as revenue in the period that control over the products is transferred to the
customer.
Subscriptions and services. Our subscriptions and services revenue consists of sales and royalties from
software arrangements, support services, professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring
engineering (“NRE”) arrangements.
Revenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be paid either at contract
inception or in
58
Table of Contents
installments over the contract term, that provide customers with a right to use the software, access general
support and maintenance, and utilize our professional services.
Our software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive beneﬁt, and the
customer obtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download. We believe
that for the majority of software arrangements, customers derive signiﬁcant beneﬁt from the ongoing
support we provide. The majority of our subscriptions and services arrangements permit our customers to
unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangements at any time at the customer’s convenience, referred to
as termination for convenience provisions, without substantive termination penalty and receive a pro-rata
refund of any prepaid fees. Accordingly, we account for arrangements with these termination for
convenience provisions as a series of daily contracts, resulting in ratable revenue recognition of software
revenue over the contractual period.
Support services consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspeciﬁed updates and
upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Support services represent stand-ready obligations for which
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.
Professional services consist of implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training
services. The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisﬁed over time, with the customer
simultaneously receiving and consuming the beneﬁts as we satisfy our performance obligations.
Rights to our IP are either sold or licensed to a customer. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the
nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if there are no
substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties
from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction
of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been
allocated.
There are two main categories of NRE contracts that we enter into with our customers: (a) NRE
contracts in which we develop a custom chip and (b) NRE contracts in which we accelerate our
development of a new chip upon the customer’s request. The majority of our NRE contract revenues meet
the over time criteria. As such, revenue is recognized over the development period with the measure of
progress using the input method based on costs incurred to total cost as the services are provided. For NRE
contracts that do not meet the over time criteria, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the NRE
services are complete.
Material rights. Contracts with customers may also include material rights that are also performance
obligations. These include the right to renew or receive products or services at a discounted price in the
future. Revenue allocated to material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the right or the
right expires.
Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is
separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.
Allocation of consideration. We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance
obligation in a bundled arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling
price reﬂects the price we would charge for a speciﬁc product or service if it were sold separately in similar
circumstances and to similar customers.
Standalone selling price. When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the
standalone selling prices for performance obligations. When directly observable transactions are not
available, our estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that
considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to, historical discounting trends for products and
services and pricing practices through diﬀerent sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs,
competitor pricing strategies, technology lifecycles and market conditions.
We separately determine the standalone selling prices by product or service type. Additionally, we
segment the standalone selling prices for products where the pricing strategies diﬀer, and where there are
diﬀerences in customers and circumstances that warrant segmentation.
We also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights. We estimate the value of the
customer’s option to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price by
estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the
likelihood that the option would be exercised.
Other Policies and Judgments
Contract modiﬁcations. We may modify contracts to oﬀer customers additional products or services.
Each of the additional products and services is generally considered distinct from those products or
services transferred to the customer before the modiﬁcation. We evaluate whether the contract price for
the additional products and services reﬂects the
59
Table of Contents
standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract. In these cases,
we account for the additional products or services as a separate contract. In other cases where the pricing
in the modiﬁcation does not reﬂect the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances
applicable to that contract, we account for the additional products or services as part of the existing
contract on a prospective basis, on a cumulative catch-up basis, or a combination of both based on the
nature of the modiﬁcation. In instances where the pricing in the modiﬁcation oﬀers the customer a credit
for a prior arrangement, we adjust our variable consideration reserves for returns and other concessions.
Right of return. Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a
portion of the product or service and receive a credit. We estimate returns based on historical returns data
which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable. We do not
recognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned.
Practical expedient elected. We do not disclose the value of unsatisﬁed performance obligations for (i)
contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize
revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. For contracts that
were modiﬁed before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented, we have not retrospectively
restated the contract for those modiﬁcations. We have disclosed the aggregate eﬀect of all modiﬁcations
when identifying the satisﬁed and unsatisﬁed performance obligations for purposes of determining the
transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition.
Research and development.  Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs
for our engineers and third parties engaged in the design and development of our products, software and
technologies, including salary, bonus and stock-based compensation expense, project material costs,
services and depreciation. Such costs are charged to research and development expense as they are
incurred.
Stock-based compensation expense.  We recognize compensation expense for time-based restricted
stock units (“RSUs”) using the straight-line amortization method based on the fair value of RSUs on the
date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is the closing market price of Broadcom common stock on the date of
grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Broadcom common stock prior to
vesting. We recognize compensation expense for time-based stock options and employee stock purchase
plan rights under the Broadcom Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (“ESPP”) based on the
estimated grant-date fair value determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a straight-line
amortization method.
Certain equity awards include both service and market conditions. The fair value of market-based
awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Compensation
expense for market-based awards is amortized based upon a graded vesting method over the service
period.
We estimate forfeitures expected to occur and recognize stock-based compensation expense for such
awards expected to vest. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on stock-
based compensation expense since the eﬀect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture
estimate is changed.
Shipping and handling costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in
net revenue and the associated expense is included in cost of revenue for all periods presented.
Litigation and settlement costs. We are involved in legal actions and other matters arising in our recent
business acquisitions and in the normal course of business. We recognize an estimated loss contingency
when the outcome is probable prior to issuance of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and we are able to
reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss.
Income taxes.  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the diﬀerences between the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in eﬀect for the year in which the diﬀerences are
expected to reverse. The eﬀect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be
realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including
scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and
recent ﬁnancial operations. If we determine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax assets in
the future in excess of their net carrying values, we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision
for income taxes or increase the beneﬁt from income taxes. Likewise, if we determine that we are not able
to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, we increase the provision for income taxes or decrease
the beneﬁt from income taxes in the period such determination is made.

The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”) introduced
signiﬁcant changes to U.S. income tax law. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of
the 2017 Tax Act require Broadcom to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in
excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. We have elected to record the
impacts of GILTI during the period incurred.
We account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on
income taxes. This guidance provides that a tax beneﬁt from an uncertain tax position may be recognized
when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of
any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.
Net income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to
common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive eﬀect of unvested RSUs, in-
the-money stock options, and ESPP rights (together referred to as “equity awards”), as well as convertible
preferred stock. Potentially dilutive shares whose eﬀect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the
computation of diluted net income per share.
The dilutive eﬀect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each ﬁscal
period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must
pay for exercising stock options and purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amount of compensation
cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase
shares. The dilutive eﬀect of convertible preferred stock is calculated using the if-converted method. The if-
converted method assumes that these securities were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to
the extent that the eﬀect is dilutive.
3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Disaggregation
We have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Oﬃcer, who has
been identiﬁed as the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) as deﬁned by the authoritative
guidance on segment reporting, in evaluating ﬁnancial performance and (2) disclosures presented outside
of our ﬁnancial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate
revenues. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and
subscriptions and services, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition,
revenues by reportable segment are presented in Note 12. “Segment Information.”
The following tables present revenue disaggregated by type of revenue and by region for the periods

Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in
Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by region based primarily on the geographic shipment location
or delivery location speciﬁed by our distributors, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers,
contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers.

Contract Assets $ 955 $ 128 
Contract Liabilities $ 2,786 $ 3,341 
Changes in our contract assets and contract liabilities primarily result from the timing diﬀerence
between our performance and the customer’s payment. We fulﬁll our obligations under a contract with a
customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. We
recognize a contract asset when we transfer products or services to a customer and the right to
consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Accounts receivable are recorded
when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. We recognize contract
liabilities when we have received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer and
we have a future obligation to transfer products or services. The majority of our contract liabilities
represents amounts billed or collected and advanced payments on contracts or arrangements which
include termination for convenience provisions. The amount of revenue recognized during ﬁscal year 2023
that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of October 30, 2022 was $2,915 million. The amount
of revenue recognized during ﬁscal year 2022 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of
October 31, 2021 was $2,615 million.
Remaining Performance Obligations
Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to
unsatisﬁed or partially unsatisﬁed performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include
unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do
not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The
customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive
penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer
software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not
considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an
original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based
royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.
Certain multi-year customer contracts, primarily in our semiconductor solutions segment, contain
ﬁrmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of
October 29, 2023 were approximately $20.3 billion. We expect approximately 30% of this amount to be
recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not
deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights.
In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one
year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of
revenue for future periods.(a)

4. Supplemental Financial Information
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents included $1,470 million and $3,915 million of time deposits and $1,650 million and
$2,365 million of money-market funds as of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, respectively. For time
deposits, carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair
value of money-market funds, which was consistent with their carrying value, was determined using
unadjusted prices in active, accessible markets for identical assets, and as such, they were classiﬁed as
Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
Accounts Receivable Factoring
We sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party ﬁnancial
institutions pursuant to factoring arrangements. We account for these transactions as sales of receivables
and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash
ﬂows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangements were $3,975 million, $3,700
million and $4,027 million during ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Factoring fees for the
sales of receivables were recorded in other income (expense), net and were not material for any of the
periods presented.

8. Retirement Plans
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension Plans
The U.S. deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans primarily consist of a qualiﬁed pension plan. Beneﬁts of the
qualiﬁed pension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance
program or a dollar-per-month program. Beneﬁt accruals under this plan were frozen in 2009. Participants
in the adjusted career-average-pay program no longer earn service accruals. Participants in the cash-
balance program no longer earn service accruals, but continue to earn 4% interest per year on their cash-
balance accounts. There are no active participants under the dollar-per-month program. We also have a
frozen non-qualiﬁed supplemental pension plan in the United States that principally provides beneﬁts based
on compensation in excess of amounts that can be considered under the qualiﬁed pension plan.
We also have deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans for certain employees in Austria, France, Germany, India,
Israel, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Eligibility is generally determined based on the terms of our plans and local
statutory requirements.

Investment Policy  
Plan assets of the U.S. qualiﬁed pension plan, which represent substantially all of the plan assets, are
generally invested in funds held by third-party fund managers. Our beneﬁt plan investment committee has
set the investment strategy to fully match the liability. We direct the overall portfolio allocation and use a
third-party investment consultant that has the discretion to structure portfolios and select the investment
managers within those allocation parameters. Multiple investment managers are utilized, including both
active and passive management approaches. The plan assets are invested using the liability-driven
investment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically
rebalanced toward asset allocation targets.
The target asset allocation for the U.S. qualiﬁed pension plan reﬂects a risk/return proﬁle that we
believe is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review
the allocation of plan assets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments
based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For both ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, 100% of the
U.S. qualiﬁed pension plan assets were allocated to ﬁxed income, in line with the target allocation. The
ﬁxed income allocation is primarily directed toward long-term core bond investments, with smaller
allocations to Treasury Inﬂation-Protected Securities and high-yield bonds.

Assumptions  
The assumptions used to determine the beneﬁt obligations and net periodic beneﬁt cost for our
deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans are presented in the table below. The expected long-term return on assets
shown in the table below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios primarily
consisting of combinations of debt, equity and other investments, depending on the plan. The long-term
rates of return are then weighted based on the asset classes in which the pension funds are invested.
Discount rates reﬂect the current rate at which deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligations could be settled based
on the measurement dates of the plans, which is October 31, the month end closest to our ﬁscal year end.
The range of assumptions reﬂects the diﬀerent economic environments within various countries.(a)

Deﬁned Contribution Plans
Our eligible U.S. employees participate in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan. Under the plan, we match
employee contributions dollar for dollar up to 6% of their eligible earnings. All matching contributions vest
immediately. During ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, we made contributions of $100 million, $96 million
and $94 million, respectively, to the 401(k) plan.
In addition, other eligible employees outside of the U.S. receive retirement beneﬁts under various
deﬁned contribution retirement plans.

We may redeem or purchase, in whole or in part, any of our senior notes prior to their respective
maturities, subject to a speciﬁed make-whole premium determined in accordance with the indentures
governing the respective notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change in control, note
holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Subsequent to the end of ﬁscal year 2023, we borrowed term loans to ﬁnance the acquisition of
VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) and assumed VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes. See Note 15.

April 2022 Senior Notes
In April 2022, we issued $750 million of 4.000% senior unsecured notes due April 2029 and $1,200
million of 4.150% senior unsecured notes due April 2032. Using the net proceeds, we redeemed the
outstanding balance of $1,020 million of our 4.700% notes due 2025 and $944 million of our 4.250% notes
due 2026. As a result of these redemptions, we incurred premiums of $85 million and wrote oﬀ $15 million
of unamortized discount and issuance costs, both of which were included in interest expense.
In April 2022, we issued $2,500 million of 4.926% senior unsecured notes due May 2037 in exchange
for $2,502 million of certain of our outstanding notes maturing between 2027 and 2030. As a result of this
exchange, we paid premiums of $47 million, which were included in unamortized discount and issuance
costs. The 4.926% notes due 2037, the 4.000% notes due 2029 and the 4.150% notes due 2032 are
collectively referred as the “April 2022 Senior Notes.”
September 2021 Senior Notes
In September 2021, we completed our private oﬀers to exchange $6.0 billion of certain of our
outstanding notes maturing between 2025 and 2030 for $3,250 million of 3.137% senior unsecured notes
due November 2035 and $2,750 million of 3.187% senior unsecured notes due November 2036
(collectively, the “September 2021 Senior Notes”). As a result of this exchange, we paid premiums of $762
million, which were included in unamortized discount and issuance costs.

March 2021 Senior Notes
In March 2021, we completed our private oﬀers to exchange $5.5 billion of certain of our outstanding
notes maturing between 2024 and 2027 (the “March 2021 Exchange Oﬀer”) for $2,250 million of 3.419%
senior unsecured notes due April 2033 and $3,250 million of 3.469% senior unsecured notes due April 2034
(collectively, the “March 2021 Senior Notes”). As a result of this exchange, we paid premiums of $581
million, which were included in unamortized discount and issuance costs.
In connection with the March 2021 Exchange Oﬀer, Broadcom Corporation (“BRCM”) and Broadcom
Technologies Inc. (“BTI”) were automatically and unconditionally released from their guarantees in
accordance with the respective indentures governing the January 2021 Senior Notes, June 2020 Senior
Notes, May 2020 Senior Notes, April 2020 Senior Notes, and April 2019 Senior Notes, as deﬁned below
respectively.
January 2021 Senior Notes
In January 2021, we issued $10 billion of senior unsecured notes (the “January 2021 Senior Notes”).
Using the net proceeds from the January 2021 Senior Notes, we repaid the outstanding balance of $5,888
million of our unsecured term A-3 facility and unsecured term A-5 facility under the credit agreement
entered into on November 4, 2019 (the “November 2019 Credit Agreement”), repurchased $3,830 million of
certain of our outstanding notes maturing between 2021 and 2023 through a cash tender oﬀer and
redemption, and repaid $282 million of our 2.200% notes upon maturity in January 2021. As a result of
these repayments and repurchases, we incurred premiums of $151 million and wrote oﬀ $47 million of
unamortized discount and issuance costs, both of which were included in interest expense.
2021 Credit Agreement
In January 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), which provides for
a ﬁve-year $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, of which $500 million is available for the issuance
of multi-currency letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit and certain other instruments would
reduce the aggregate amount otherwise available under the revolving credit facility for revolving loans.
Subject to the terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement, we are permitted to borrow, repay and reborrow
revolving loans at any time prior to the earlier of (a) January 19, 2026 and (b) the date of termination in
whole of the revolving lenders’ commitments under the 2021 Credit Agreement. In connection with the
2021 Credit Agreement, we terminated the credit agreement entered into on May 7, 2019, which provided
for a ﬁve-year $5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, and the November 2019 Credit Agreement. We
had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at either October 29, 2023 or October 30,
2022.
June 2020 Senior Notes
In June 2020, we completed our private oﬀers to exchange $3,742 million of certain series of our
outstanding senior notes maturing between 2021 and 2024 for $1,695 million of senior notes due 2026 and
$2,222 million of senior notes due 2028 (collectively, the “June 2020 Senior Notes”).
May 2020 Senior Notes
In May 2020, we issued $8 billion of senior unsecured notes (the “May 2020 Senior Notes”). Using the
net proceeds, we repaid certain term loans under the November 2019 Credit Agreement and all
outstanding borrowings under a revolving credit facility.
April 2020 Senior Notes
In April 2020, we issued $4.5 billion of senior unsecured notes (the “April 2020 Senior Notes”). Using
the net proceeds, we repurchased certain series of our outstanding senior notes maturing between 2021
and 2022, pursuant to a cash tender oﬀer that we completed in April 2020.
April 2019 Senior Notes
In April 2019, we issued $11 billion of senior unsecured notes (the “April 2019 Senior Notes”). Using the
net proceeds, we repaid certain term loans.

Registered Exchange Oﬀer
In connection with the issuance of the June 2020 Senior Notes, the May 2020 Senior Notes, the April
2020 Senior Notes (collectively, the “2020 Senior Notes”) and the April 2019 Senior Notes, we entered into
registration rights agreements, pursuant to which we were obligated to use commercially reasonable eﬀorts
to ﬁle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and cause to be declared eﬀective, a
registration statement with respect to an oﬀer to exchange (the “Registered Exchange Oﬀer”) each series
of the 2020 Senior Notes and the April 2019 Senior Notes for notes that are registered with the SEC (the
“Registered Notes”), with substantially identical terms. We completed the Registered Exchange Oﬀer on
August 10, 2020. Substantially all of our 2020 Senior Notes and April 2019 Senior Notes were tendered and
exchanged for the corresponding Registered Notes in the Registered Exchange Oﬀer.
Commercial Paper
    In February 2019, we established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue
unsecured commercial paper notes (“Commercial Paper”) in principal amount of up to $2 billion
outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. Commercial Paper is sold
under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or,
alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of
their issuance. The discount associated with the Commercial Paper is amortized to interest expense over its
term. Outstanding Commercial Paper reduces the amount that would otherwise be available to borrow for
general corporate purposes under our revolving credit facility. We had no Commercial Paper outstanding at
either October 29, 2023 or October 30, 2022.
2017 Senior Notes
During the ﬁscal year ended October 29, 2017, Broadcom Cayman Finance Limited, which
subsequently merged into BTI during the ﬁscal year ended November 3, 2019 (“ﬁscal year 2019”) with BTI
remaining as the surviving entity, and BRCM issued $17,550 million of senior unsecured notes (the “2017
Senior Notes”). Our 2017 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an
unsecured, unsubordinated basis by Broadcom and BTI. Using the net proceeds, plus cash on hand, we
repaid certain term loans and ﬁnanced the acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.
During the ﬁscal year ended November 4, 2018, substantially all of the 2017 Senior Notes were
tendered and exchanged for notes registered with the SEC, with substantially identical terms.    
Assumed CA Senior Notes
In connection with our acquisition of CA, Inc. (“CA”) during ﬁscal year 2019, we assumed $2.25 billion
of CA’s outstanding senior unsecured notes (the “Assumed CA Senior Notes”). CA remains the sole obligor
under the Assumed CA Senior Notes.
Fair Value of Debt
As of October 29, 2023, the estimated aggregate fair value of our debt was $33,181 million. The fair
value of our senior notes was determined using quoted prices from less active markets. All of our debt
obligations are categorized as Level 2 instruments.

On September 30, 2019, we completed an oﬀering of approximately 4 million shares of Mandatory
Convertible Preferred Stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately $3,679 million and would
automatically convert into shares of our common stock on September 30, 2022.
The holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to receive, when, as and if declared
by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, out of funds legally available for payment,
cumulative dividends at the annual rate of 8.00% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share
(equivalent to $80 annually per share), payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of
shares of our common stock or any combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.
During ﬁscal year 2022, outstanding shares of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock converted
into an aggregate of approximately 12 million shares of our common stock at conversion rates ranging
between 3.0894 and 3.1149 common shares per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. We paid
cash in lieu of fractional shares of common stock upon conversion.
Stock Repurchase Programs
In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to
$10 billion of our common stock from time to time through December 31, 2022, which was subsequently
extended to December 31, 2023. In May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase
program to repurchase up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock from time to time through
December 31, 2023. We repurchased and retired approximately 9 million and 12 million shares of our
common stock for $5,824 million and $7,000 million under these stock repurchase programs during ﬁscal
years 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be eﬀected through a variety of methods,
including open market or privately negotiated purchases. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will
depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements,
alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. We are not obligated to
repurchase any speciﬁc amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase programs may be
suspended or terminated at any time.
Equity Incentive Award Plan
2012 Plan
In connection with the acquisition of BRCM, we assumed the BRCM 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“Original 2012 Plan”) and outstanding unvested RSUs originally granted by BRCM under the Original 2012
Plan that were held by continuing employees. During the second quarter of ﬁscal year 2021, our
stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Original 2012 Plan, now called the
Broadcom Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2012 Plan”). Under the Amended 2012 Plan, we
may grant stock options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair
market value on the date of grant, restricted stock awards, and RSUs to employees. No participant may be
granted such awards for more than an aggregate of 4 million shares in any ﬁscal year. Equity awards
granted under the Amended 2012 Plan generally vest over four years. The Amended 2012 Plan reduced the
number of shares available for new equity award grants to 20 million shares and removed the annual share
replenishment provision provided under the Original 2012 Plan. During the second quarter of ﬁscal year
2023, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Amended 2012 Plan to increase
the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 25 million shares. Awards cancelled or
forfeited and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations become available for future issuance. As
of October 29, 2023, 36 million shares remained available for issuance under the Amended 2012 Plan.
We may grant market-based RSUs with both a service condition and a market condition as part of our
equity compensation programs. The market-based RSUs generally vest over four years, subject to
satisfaction of market conditions. During ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, we granted market-based RSUs
under which grantees may receive the number of
77
Table of Contents
shares ranging from 0% to 300% of the original grant at vesting based upon the total stockholder return
(“TSR”) on our common stock on an absolute basis and as compared to the TSR of an index group of
companies. During ﬁscal year 2023, we also granted market-based RSUs vesting over ﬁve years, subject to
satisfaction of stock price performance milestones.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in us
through periodic payroll deductions, based on a 6-month look-back period, at a price equal to the lesser of
85% of the fair market value of our common stock at either the beginning or the end of the relevant
oﬀering period. The ESPP is structured as a qualiﬁed employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However, the ESPP is not intended to be a qualiﬁed pension, proﬁt
sharing or stock bonus plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is not subject
to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Excess income tax beneﬁts for stock-based awards exercised
or released $ 507 $ 375 $ 310 
We have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for RSUs of 5%. We will recognize additional expense if
actual forfeitures are lower than we estimated, and will recognize a beneﬁt if actual forfeitures are higher
than we estimated.
During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors
approved a broad-based program of multi-year equity grants of time- and market-based RSUs (the “Multi-
Year Equity Awards”) in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on March 15 of each
year. Each Multi-Year Equity Award vests on the same basis as four annual grants made March 15 of each
year, beginning in ﬁscal year 2019, with successive four-year vesting periods. Stock-based compensation
expense related to the Multi-Year Equity Awards was $596 million, $794 million and $816 million for ﬁscal
years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
As of October 29, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based
awards was $6,375 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average
service period of 3.4 years.
The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions utilized to calculate the fair value
of market-based awards granted in the periods presented:
Fiscal Year
2023 2022 2021
Risk-free interest rate 4.0 % 1.4 % 0.3 %
Dividend yield 3.3 % 2.7 % 3.0 %
Volatility 32.8 % 37.1 % 39.0 %
Expected term (in years) 4.8 3.4 3.4
The risk-free interest rate was derived from the average U.S. Treasury Strips rate, which approximated
the rate in eﬀect appropriate for the term at the time of grant.
The dividend yield was based on the historical and expected dividend payouts as of the respective
award grant dates.
The volatility was based on our own historical stock price volatility over the period commensurate with
the expected life of the awards and the implied volatility of a 180-day call option on our own common stock
measured at a speciﬁc date.
The expected term was commensurate with the awards’ contractual terms.

value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested. The number of RSUs vested included shares

Other, net 0.2  0.2  (0.2)
Eﬀective tax rate on income before income taxes 6.7 % 7.5 % 0.4 %
The increase in provision for income taxes in ﬁscal year 2023 compared to ﬁscal year 2022 was
primarily due to higher income before income taxes, partially oﬀset by an increase in the recognition of
uncertain tax beneﬁts as a result of lapses of statutes of limitations. The increase in provision for income
taxes in ﬁscal year 2022 compared to ﬁscal year 2021 was primarily due to higher income before income
taxes.
We derive the eﬀective tax rate beneﬁt attributed to foreign income taxed at diﬀerent rates primarily
from our operations in Singapore and Malaysia. Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic
Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or
reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions speciﬁed in these
incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax incentives are expected to expire in
November 2025. We have also obtained a tax holiday from our qualifying income earned in Malaysia, which
is scheduled to expire in ﬁscal year 2028. The tax holiday that we negotiated in Malaysia is also subject to
our compliance with various operating and other conditions. Before taking into consideration the eﬀects of
the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts, the eﬀect of these tax incentives and tax
holiday decreased the provision for income taxes by approximately $2,104 million, $1,821 million and
$1,156 million for ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The 2017 Tax Act amended Internal Revenue Code Section 174 to require businesses to capitalize and
amortize research and development expenses and became eﬀective in our ﬁscal year 2023. In ﬁscal year
2023, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $275 million for capitalized research and development.
We continue to indeﬁnitely reinvest $1,963 million of certain accumulated foreign earnings. The
unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is estimated to be $206 million. All
other current and future earnings of all our foreign subsidiaries are not considered permanently reinvested.
As of October 29, 2023, we had tax eﬀected U.S. state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of
$136 million and foreign NOL carryforwards of $128 million. The state and foreign NOL carryforwards expire
in various years beginning in ﬁscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively. We had $1,462 million of state
research and development tax credits which begin to expire in ﬁscal year 2024. We have provided a
valuation allowance on substantially all state tax credits and state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards as we do not expect them to be realized.

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax beneﬁts within the provision for
income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties were included within other long-term liabilities. During ﬁscal
years 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized interest and penalties of $22 million, $25 million and
$46 million respectively, within the provision for income taxes. As of October 29, 2023 and October 30,
2022, the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was approximately $389 million
and $411 million, respectively.
As of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, approximately $5,044 million and $5,528 million,
respectively, of the unrecognized tax beneﬁts and accrued interest and penalties would, if recognized,
beneﬁt our eﬀective income tax rate. We are subject to U.S. income tax examination for ﬁscal years 2018
and later. Certain of our acquired companies are subject to tax examinations in major jurisdictions outside
of the U.S. for ﬁscal years 2008 and later. It is possible that our existing unrecognized tax beneﬁts may
change up to $499 million as a result of lapses of the statute of limitations for certain audit periods and/or
audit examinations expected to be completed within the next 12 months.
12. Segment Information
Reportable Segments
We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Each segment
has separate ﬁnancial information that is utilized on a regular basis by the CODM in determining how to
allocate resources and evaluate performance. The reportable segments are determined based on several
factors including, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products, technology, delivery

Our CODM assesses the performance of each segment and allocates resources to each segment based
on net revenue and operating results and does not evaluate each segment using discrete asset information.
Operating results by segment include items that are directly attributable to each segment and also include
shared expenses such as marketing, general and administrative activities, facilities and information
technology (“IT”) expenses. Shared expenses are primarily allocated based on revenue and headcount.

Unallocated Expenses
Unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based
compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, and other costs, which
are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Acquisition-related
costs include transaction costs and any costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of acquired
businesses.
Depreciation expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in the operating
results of each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation expense by operating
segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There was no inter-segment revenue for any of the
periods presented. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies.

Geographic Information
Net revenue by country is based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location as speciﬁed
by the distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers who purchased
our products or services. For the majority of our products, title and control transfer to our customers in
Penang, Malaysia. The products are then transported to the customer speciﬁc locations. Net revenue from
the United States for ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $6,975 million, $5,915 million and $5,285
million, respectively. Net revenue from China (including Hong Kong) for ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021
was $11,533 million, $11,637 million and $9,752 million, respectively. Net revenue from Singapore for ﬁscal
years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $4,479 million, $4,003 million and $2,754 million, respectively. Net
revenue from other foreign countries for ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $12,832 million, $11,648
million and $9,659 million, respectively. These geographic delivery locations are not necessarily indicative
of the geographic location of our end customers or the country in which our end customers sell
devices containing our products. For example, we believe a substantial portion of our products shipped or
delivered to China (including Hong Kong) is included in devices sold by our end customers in the United
States and Europe.

Purchase Commitments. Represent unconditional purchase obligations to purchase goods or services,
primarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all signiﬁcant terms,
including ﬁxed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions, and the approximate timing of the
transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and
unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term of one year or less.
Other Contractual Commitments. Represent amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT
and other service agreements.
Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outﬂows associated with our
unrecognized tax beneﬁts at October 29, 2023, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash
settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $2,792 million of unrecognized tax beneﬁts
and accrued interest and penalties as of October 29, 2023 have been excluded from the table above.
Contingencies
From time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies
engaged in our lines of business, including commercial disputes, employment issues, tax disputes and
disputes involving claims by third parties that our activities infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or
other IP rights, as well as regulatory investigations or inquiries. Legal proceedings and regulatory
investigations or inquiries are often complex, may require the expenditure of signiﬁcant funds and other
resources, and the outcomes of such proceedings are inherently uncertain, with material adverse outcomes
possible. IP property claims generally involve the demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture,
use or sale of the allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages
or royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing IP. Claims that our products or
processes infringe or misappropriate any
84
Table of Contents
third-party IP rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemniﬁcation of our customers)
often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Moreover,
from time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights. Regardless of the merit or resolution of any
such litigation, complex IP litigation is generally costly and diverts the eﬀorts and attention of our
management and technical personnel.
Lawsuits Relating to California Institute of Technology
California Institute of Technology ("Caltech") ﬁled a complaint against Broadcom and Apple Inc. on May
26, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “U.S. Central District
Court”), and an amended complaint adding Cypress Semiconductor Corporation as a defendant on August
15, 2016. The amended complaint alleged that chips that support certain error correction codes as
speciﬁed in IEEE Standards 802.11n and 802.11ac willfully infringed four patents related to error correction
coding: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781; and 8,284,833 (“’833 patent”). Prior to trial,
Caltech dismissed its claims against Cypress and withdrew its infringement allegations as to ‘833 patent.
The complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, pre- and post-judgment interest,
as well as attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses. The trial was held in January 2020, and on January 29,
2020, the jury issued its verdict ﬁnding infringement and awarding Caltech past damages of $270.2 million
from Broadcom and $837.8 million from Apple, for which Apple is seeking indemniﬁcation from Broadcom.
On August 3, 2020, the U.S. Central District Court issued its judgment, awarding Caltech past damages in
the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest. Additionally, the U.S. Central
District Court awarded Caltech an unspeciﬁed amount of ongoing royalties to be determined after the
anticipated appeals process is resolved. Neither the jury nor the U.S. Central District Court found willful
infringement, which if it had, could have resulted in enhanced damages up to three times the amount
awarded. Broadcom and Apple appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the
“Federal Circuit Court”). In February 2022, the Federal Circuit Court aﬃrmed infringement of two patents,
both of which expired in August 2020, but it did not address all issues and ordered a new trial on damages
and on the infringement of the 7,916,781 patent, which also expired in August 2020. In May 2022, the
Federal Circuit Court denied the petition for rehearing ﬁled by Broadcom and Apple, and remanded the case
to the U.S. Central District Court. Subsequently, Caltech withdrew its infringement allegations as to the
7,916,781 patent. In September 2023, we entered into a settlement and patent license agreement with
Caltech pursuant to which we agreed to pay an aggregate of $160 million over ﬁve years and the case was
dismissed with prejudice.
Other Matters
In addition to the matters discussed above, we are currently engaged in a number of legal actions in
the ordinary course of our business.
Contingency Assessment
We do not believe, based on currently available facts and circumstances, that the ﬁnal outcome of any
pending legal proceedings or ongoing regulatory investigations, taken individually or as a whole, will have a
material adverse eﬀect on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements. However, lawsuits may involve complex
questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of signiﬁcant funds and other resources to
defend. The results of litigation or regulatory investigations are inherently uncertain, and material adverse
outcomes are possible. From time to time, we may enter into conﬁdential discussions regarding the
potential settlement of such lawsuits. Any settlement of pending litigation could require us to incur
substantial costs and other ongoing expenses, such as future royalty payments in the case of an IP dispute.
During the periods presented, no material amounts have been accrued or disclosed in the
accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements with respect to loss contingencies associated with any
other legal proceedings or regulatory investigations, as potential losses for such matters are not considered
probable and ranges of losses are not reasonably estimable. These matters are subject to many
uncertainties and the ultimate outcomes are not predictable. There can be no assurances that the actual
amounts required to satisfy any liabilities arising from the matters described above will not have a material
adverse eﬀect on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Other Indemniﬁcations
As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many
of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into
contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for IP claims related to the use of our
products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees,
companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against
combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the
use of our products, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned
facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts,
usually up to a speciﬁed maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to
these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liabilities or
environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemniﬁcations are rare and the
associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material.

14. Restructuring and Other Charges
Restructuring Charges
From time to time, we initiate cost reduction activities to integrate acquired businesses, align our
workforce with strategic business activities, or improve eﬃciencies in our operations. We recognized
charges of $36 million, $55 million and $149 million during ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
These charges were primarily recognized in operating expenses.
The following table summarizes the signiﬁcant activities within, and components of, the restructuring
liabilities:

Restructuring charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the ﬁscal years 2023, 2022 and
2021 included $7 million, $25 million and $36 million respectively, for the write-down of certain lease-
related ROU assets and other lease-related charges. As of each October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022,
short-term and long-term lease liabilities included $44 million and $52 million of liabilities related to
restructuring activities.
Other Charges
During ﬁscal year 2023, other charges included $204 million of non-recurring charges related to IP
litigation and $8 million of impairment and disposal charges primarily related to property, plant and
equipment. During ﬁscal years 2022 and 2021, other charges included impairment and disposal charges of
$7 million and $16 million, respectively, primarily related to leasehold improvements.
15. Subsequent Events
Acquisition of VMware, Inc.
On November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the
“VMware Merger”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the eﬀective time of the VMware Merger was indirectly
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock,
either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder
election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive
cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock,
in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and
outstanding. Based on the VMware stockholders’ elections, the VMware stockholders received
approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 54.4 million shares of Broadcom common stock in aggregate.
We assumed all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by
continuing employees. The assumed awards were converted into approximately 5 million Broadcom RSU
awards. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee
directors were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common
stock, in equal parts.
VMware was a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation
with enterprise control. We acquired VMware to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities.

We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023
Term Loans, as discussed in further detail below, as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of
VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes.
We are currently evaluating the purchase price allocation following the consummation of the VMware
Merger. It is not practicable to disclose the preliminary purchase price allocation or unaudited pro forma
combined ﬁnancial information for this transaction, given the short period of time between the acquisition
date and the issuance of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
2023 Term Loans
On August 15, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2023 Credit Agreement”), which
provided us with the ability to borrow term loans in connection with the VMware Merger. In connection with
entering into the 2023 Credit Agreement, we terminated the commitment letter for a senior unsecured
bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion that we entered into on May 26, 2022. Upon
completion of the VMware Merger, we entered an $11,195 million unsecured term A-2 facility (the "Term A-2
Loan”), an $11,195 million unsecured term A-3 facility (the “Term A-3 Loan”), and an $8,000 million
unsecured term A-5 facility (the “Term A-5 Loan”, collectively, the “2023 Term Loans”).
The term loans under the Term A-2 Loan, Term A-3 Loan and Term A-5 Loan bear interest at ﬂoating
interest rates and will mature and be payable on the second, third or ﬁfth anniversary, respectively, of the
date of the VMware Merger. Our obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement are unsecured and are not
guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries.
Cash Dividends Declared
On December 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $5.25 per share on
our common stock, payable on December 29, 2023 to stockholders of record on December 20, 2023.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Oﬃcer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial
Oﬃcer (“CFO”), evaluated the eﬀectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 29,
2023. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it ﬁles or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the
SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
ﬁles or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
its principal executive and principal ﬁnancial oﬃcers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-beneﬁt relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
October 29, 2023, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures
were eﬀective at the reasonable assurance level.(a)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting. Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
executive and principal ﬁnancial oﬃcers and eﬀected by the Board, management and other personnel, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reﬂect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of us are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material eﬀect on the ﬁnancial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of eﬀectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of
October 29, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of October 29, 2023,
our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is eﬀective based on those criteria.
The eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of October 29, 2023 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting ﬁrm, as stated in
their report which is included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting (as deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter ended October 29, 2023 that has materially
aﬀected, or is reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
