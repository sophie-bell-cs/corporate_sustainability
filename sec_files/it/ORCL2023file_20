agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material eﬀect on our results of 
operations and our belief that our net deferred tax assets will likely be realized in the 
foreseeable future;

•the possibility that we may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to 
the initiation of new restructuring plans;

activity may be modiﬁed in comparison to past periods in order to use available cash for

debt is reduced below certain thresholds;

such shortages, including committing to higher purchases and balances of hardware 
products, will continue to impact us in the future;
as well as other statements regarding our future operations, ﬁnancial condition and prospects, and 
business strategies. Forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words 
“anticipates,” “believes,” “endeavors,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “is designed to,” “plans,”

for forward-looking statements contained in the Exchange Act and the Securities Act for all forward-
looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and

assumptions about our business that could aﬀect our future results and could cause those results or 
other outcomes to diﬀer materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
Factors that might cause or contribute to such diﬀerences include, but are not limited to, those 
discussed in “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report and as may be updated in ﬁlings we 
make from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including our 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be ﬁled by us in our ﬁscal year 2024, which runs from June 1, 2023 to 
May 31, 2024.

of new information, future events or risks, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If 
we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make 
additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New information, future 
events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Annual Report not to occur. You 
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reﬂect our expectations 
only as of the date of this Annual Report.

PART I
Item 1.Business
Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. 
Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure oﬀerings that are delivered 
worldwide through a variety of ﬂexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include 
on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and 
cloud-based deployments), such as Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region oﬀerings 
(instances of Oracle Cloud in a customer’s own data center) and multicloud options that enable 
customers to use Oracle Cloud in conjunction with other public clouds. Accordingly, we oﬀer choice and 
ﬂexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best 
suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, 
educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales 
force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, 
deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations, 
including, for example, a global cloud applications developer that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 
(OCI) to power its software-as-a-service (SaaS) oﬀerings; a multi-national ﬁnancial institution that runs 
its banking applications using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer; and a global consumer products 
company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning for its accounting processes, 
risk management, supply chain and ﬁnancial planning functions.
Oracle SaaS and OCI (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) oﬀerings provide comprehensive and 
integrated applications and infrastructure services delivered via various cloud delivery models enabling 
our customers to choose the best option that meets their speciﬁc business needs. Oracle Cloud Services 
integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, on a customer’s behalf in a 
cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for the customer and 
that a customer may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices. 
Oracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to 
innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, 
integration and testing work; connectable among diﬀering deployment models to enable interoperability 
and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT and cloud 
environments; cost-eﬀective by lowering upfront customer investments and implementing usage-based 
resource consumption costs; and highly secure, standards-based and reliable. 
Oracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment oﬀerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle 
Database and Oracle Middleware software oﬀerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT 
infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. 
Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle 
license. 
Oracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-speciﬁc 
products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they 
purchase Oracle hardware products. Oracle also oﬀers professional services to assist our customers and 
partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services. Providing 
choice and ﬂexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and 
infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that oﬀering 
customers broad, comprehensive, ﬂexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications 
and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer 
needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer oﬀerings, more restrictive deployment 
models and less ﬂexibility for a customer’s transition to cloud-based IT environments.
Our investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we oﬀer through 
our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are 
another important element of our corporate strategy. In ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we invested $8.6 
billion, $7.2 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing 
portfolio of oﬀerings and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to 
how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another, including 
through the use of OCI to power our Oracle Fusion SaaS Applications, which we and our customers use to 
run internal business processes. We focus our development eﬀorts 
3
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
on improving the performance, security, reliability, operation, integration and cost-eﬀectiveness of our 
oﬀerings relative to our competitors; facilitating the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, 
use, manage and maintain our oﬀerings; and incorporating emerging technologies within our oﬀerings to 
enable leaner business processes, automation and innovation. For example, the Oracle Autonomous 
Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure as an OCI oﬀering that uses machine 
learning capabilities to automate many traditionally manual functions. After an initial purchase of Oracle 
products and services, our customers can continue to beneﬁt from our oﬀerings, research and 
development eﬀorts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support oﬀerings 
for their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we 
periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us. 
Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We 
believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can oﬀer to customers, expand 
our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings and 
increase stockholder value. We have invested billions of dollars over time to acquire a number of 
companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise 
enhanced our existing oﬀerings, including our acquisition of Cerner Corporation (Cerner) in June 2022 
(see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for 
additional information). We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and 
technologies to further our corporate strategy.
We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services. Each business is comprised of a 
single operating segment. Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included 
elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating 
segments.
Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to 
operations originally begun in June 1977.
Oracle Applications and Infrastructure Technologies
Oracle’s comprehensive portfolio of applications and infrastructure technologies is designed to address 
an organization’s IT environment needs, including business process, infrastructure and applications 
development requirements, among others. Oracle technologies are based upon industry standards and 
are designed to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure. Oracle applications and infrastructure 
technologies, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, 
virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and 
services, are the building blocks of Oracle Cloud Services, our partners’ cloud services and our 
customers’ cloud IT environments. Oracle applications and infrastructure oﬀerings are marketed and 
sold through our cloud and license and hardware businesses and are delivered through the Oracle Cloud 
or through other IT deployment models, including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise deployments. 
We believe that our Oracle Cloud Services oﬀerings are opportunities for us to continue to expand our 
cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasingly recognize the value of access to 
the latest versions of Oracle cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, 
rapidly deployable, ﬂexible and interoperable services model that Oracle provisions, manages, upgrades 
and maintains on our customers’ behalf. We believe that we can market and sell our Oracle Cloud 
Services oﬀerings together to help new and existing customers migrate their extensive installed base of 
on-premise and cloud-based applications and infrastructure technologies to the Oracle Cloud and we 
believe we are in the early stages of what we expect will be a material migration of our existing Oracle 
customer base from on-premise applications and infrastructure products and services to the Oracle 
Cloud. In addition, we also believe we can market our Oracle Cloud Services oﬀerings to a broader 
ecosystem of small and medium-sized businesses, non-IT lines of business purchasers, developers and 
partners due to the highly available, intuitive design, ease of access, low touch and low cost 
characteristics of the Oracle Cloud. 
In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered 
through our Oracle Cloud Services deployment models has increased. To address customer demand and 
enable customer choice, 
4
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure 
licenses and license support contracts to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and 
expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues 
relative to our total revenues has increased and our cloud services revenues represented 32%, 25% and 
22% of our total revenues during ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect these trends to 
continue.
Oracle Applications Technologies
Oracle applications technologies are marketed, sold, delivered and supported through our cloud and 
license business. Our applications cloud services and license support revenues represented 47%, 42% 
and 41% of our total cloud services and license support revenues during ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. Oracle applications oﬀerings include our Oracle Cloud SaaS oﬀerings, which are available 
for customers as a subscription, and Oracle applications license oﬀerings, which are available for 
customers to purchase for use within the Oracle Cloud and other cloud-based and on-premise IT 
environments, and include the option to purchase related license support. Regardless of the deployment 
model selected, our applications technologies are designed to reduce the risk, cost and complexity of 
our customers’ IT infrastructures, while supporting customer choice with ﬂexible deployment models 
that readily enable performance, agility, compatibility and extendibility. Our applications technologies 
are generally designed using industry standard architectures to manage and automate core business 
functions across the enterprise, as well as to help customers diﬀerentiate and innovate in those 
processes unique to their industries or organizations. We oﬀer applications that are deployable to meet 
several business automation requirements across a broad range of industries. We also oﬀer industry-
speciﬁc applications, which provide solutions to customers in the automotive, communications, 
construction and engineering, consumer goods, energy and water, ﬁnancial services, food and beverage, 
government and education, healthcare, high technology, hospitality, industrial manufacturing, life 
sciences, media and entertainment, oil and gas, professional services, retail, travel and transportation 
and wholesale distribution industries, among others.
Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
Oracle’s broad spectrum of Oracle Cloud SaaS oﬀerings provides customers a choice of software 
applications that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we deploy, manage, upgrade and 
support and that customers purchase by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated 
period. Customers access Oracle Cloud SaaS oﬀerings utilizing common web browsers via a broad 
spectrum of devices. Our SaaS oﬀerings are built upon open industry standards such as SQL, Java and 
HTML5 for easier application accessibility, integration and development. Our SaaS oﬀerings represent an 
industry leading business innovation platform, leveraging Oracle’s Next-Generation Cloud Infrastructure, 
and include a broad suite of modular, next-generation cloud software applications spanning all core 
business functions, including, among others:
•Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), which is designed to be a complete, 
global and integrated ERP solution to help organizations improve decision making and workforce 
productivity, and to optimize back-oﬃce operations by utilizing a single data and security model 
with a common user interface; 
•Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Performance Management (EPM), which is designed to analyze 
ﬁnancial performance, drive accurate and agile ﬁnancial plans, optimize the ﬁnancial close and 
consolidation process, streamline account reconciliation and satisfy an organization’s reporting 
requirements;
•Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain and Manufacturing Management (SCM), which is designed to 
help organizations create, optimize and digitize their supply chains and innovate products 
quickly; 
•Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), which is designed to help organizations 
ﬁnd, develop and retain their talent, enable collaboration, provide complete workforce insights, 
improve business process eﬃciency and enable users to connect to an integrated suite of HCM 
applications from any device;
•Oracle Fusion Sales, Service and Marketing, which are modules that are designed to be complete 
and integrated solutions to help organizations deliver consistent and personalized customer 
experiences across their customer channels, touch points and interactions;
5
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
•NetSuite Applications Suite, which is designed to be a uniﬁed, cloud-based applications suite to 
run a company’s entire business and includes ﬁnancials and ERP, customer relationship 
management, human resources, professional services and commerce, among others. Our 
NetSuite applications are generally marketed to small to medium-sized organizations; 
•Oracle Cerner healthcare, which is designed to enable medical professionals to deliver better 
healthcare to individual patients and communities; and 
•Oracle Advertising, which is designed to enable organizations to leverage their own data and 
consumer data to inform and measure marketing strategies and programs.
In addition, we oﬀer several cloud-based industry solutions to address speciﬁc customer needs within 
certain industries including communications, construction and engineering, education, ﬁnancial services, 
government, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing and retail, among others.
Customers, partners and other interested parties may elect to subscribe to Oracle applications and 
infrastructure training and certiﬁcation programs through a variety of online, cloud-based learning 
subscriptions oﬀered by Oracle University. Learners generally have unlimited access to course content 
delivered during the subscription period.
We believe that the comprehensiveness and breadth of our SaaS oﬀerings as a business innovation 
platform diﬀerentiate us from many of our competitors that oﬀer more limited or specialized 
applications. Our SaaS oﬀerings are designed to support connected business processes in the cloud and 
are centered on an intuitive and conversational user experience, a responsive, open and ﬂexible 
business core and a common data model. We believe Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP is a strategic suite of 
applications that is foundational to facilitating and extracting more business value out of the adoption of 
other Oracle SaaS oﬀerings, such as Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM and Oracle Fusion Cloud EPM, as 
customers realize the value of a common data model that spans across core business applications. We 
believe our SaaS oﬀerings remove business boundaries between front- and back-oﬃce activities. Our 
SaaS oﬀerings are designed to deliver a secure data isolation architecture and ﬂexible upgrades; self-
service access controls for users; a Service-Oriented Architecture; built-in social, mobile and business 
insight capabilities (analytics); and a high performance, high availability infrastructure based on Oracle’s 
Next-Generation Cloud Infrastructure. These SaaS capabilities are designed to simplify customer IT 
environments, reduce time to implement and upgrade, enable agility, reduce risk, provide an intuitive 
user experience for casual and experienced users and enable customers to focus resources on business 
growth opportunities. Our SaaS oﬀerings are also designed to natively incorporate advanced 
technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning, blockchain, 
digital assistants and advances in the “human interface” and how users interact with Oracle Cloud SaaS 
oﬀerings within a business context or to augment human capabilities to enhance productivity. 
Oracle Applications Licenses
Customers have the ability to license Oracle Applications, including Oracle E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, 
JD Edwards and Siebel applications, among others, for use within the Oracle Cloud or within their own 
cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. These licensed applications are designed to manage and 
automate core business functions across the enterprise, including HCM, ERP, EPM, SCM, Customer 
Experience and industry-speciﬁc applications, as described above, among others. 
Oracle License Support
Oracle license support oﬀerings are marketed and sold as a part of our cloud and license business. We 
provide customers the option to purchase license support contracts in connection with the purchase of 
Oracle Applications licenses. Substantially all of our customers opt to purchase license support contracts 
when they purchase Oracle applications and infrastructure licenses to run within the Oracle Cloud or 
other cloud-based and on-premise IT environments. We believe our license support oﬀerings protect and 
enhance our customers’ investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies because 
they provide proactive and personalized support services (including Oracle Lifetime Support) and

Manufacturing 
We rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce most of our hardware products that we market 
and sell to customers and utilize internally to deliver Oracle Cloud Services, and we distribute most of 
our hardware products from these partners’ facilities. Our manufacturing processes are substantially 
based on standardization of components across product types and centralization of assembly and 
distribution centers. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, 
product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of suppliers. For most of our hardware 
products, we have existing alternative sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, 
we do rely on sole sources for certain hardware components. We monitor and evaluate potential risks of 
disruption within our supply chain operations. Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this 
Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and 
availability of supplies for our hardware products and the related risks to our businesses. 
Sales and Marketing
We directly market and sell our cloud, license, hardware, support and services oﬀerings globally to 
businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We 
also market and sell our oﬀerings globally through indirect channels. 
In the United States (U.S.), our sales and services employees are based throughout the country. Outside 
the U.S., our international subsidiaries sell, support and service our oﬀerings in their local countries as 
well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary. Our 
geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce, 
provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to oﬀset geography-speciﬁc economic trends 
and oﬀers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our oﬀerings. Our international 
operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A 
of this Annual Report. A summary of our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set 
forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
We also market our product oﬀerings worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise 
our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is 
a global program that manages our business relationships with a large, broad-based network of

None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions; however, in certain foreign 
subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that D&I powers innovation and that the diversity of our workforce is critical to helping our 
customers solve diﬃcult problems. Our focus on D&I is reﬂected throughout our organization, starting at 
the highest level. Our Chief Executive Oﬃcer is a woman and forty percent of the members of our Board 
of Directors are women and/or come from a diverse background. We endeavor to hire employees from a 
broad pool of talent with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and abilities and we believe Oracle’s leaders 
serve as role models for our diverse and inclusive workforce. We strive to enable our employees to 
further their careers, build their networks and foster the skills needed to succeed at Oracle, including 
through participation in our Employee Resource Groups, which oﬀer employees opportunities to engage 
in mentor relationships and further develop diverse leaders and employees at Oracle. We seek to 
continuously build on our inclusive hiring strategies, tracking our progress and holding ourselves 
accountable for greater diversity at Oracle. Our programs are supported by Oracle leaders across the 
company with strategic sponsorship from Oracle’s Executive Diversity Council, which is led by Safra 
Catz, our Chief Executive Oﬃcer, and extend through the actions we are taking globally on Oracle’s ﬁve 
D&I Imperatives:
•driving insight and accountability with data;
•recruiting with an intention on diversity;
•embedding inclusion into talent development;
•inspiring an inclusive culture through community; and
•investing in the future diversity of our industry.
In addition to global, regional and local programs, Oracle Human Resources partners with business 
leaders to create and implement D&I plans to embed targeted strategies into organizations across 
Oracle. Employee satisfaction on the importance of D&I at Oracle and their manager’s encouragement 
of diverse ideas and perspectives ranks high in our employee engagement surveys.
We are proud to be recognized for our ongoing progress and commitment to D&I. Examples of 
recognition received include being named one of the World’s Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of 
America’s Best Employers For Women by Forbes in 2022 and one of America’s Best Employers For

Employee Experience
Oracle strives to deliver a great employee experience, anchored by meaningful work, career 
opportunities and well-being to continue to attract and retain high quality talent. We support employee 
well-being from multiple dimensions, including economic, health, development and lifestyle with a 
comprehensive suite of compensation, beneﬁts and learning and development.
Opportunities to Learn and Grow
We believe that one of the primary reasons candidates join Oracle is for the opportunity to develop their 
careers. We have programs and resources to help our employees explore, build and achieve their career 
goals. We promote regular career conversations between leaders and employees. These are separate 
from performance feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify and take steps 
to grow their careers. Our Talent Review process, which runs on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the 
mechanism for leaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 29% 
of our open non-entry level positions were ﬁlled internally in ﬁscal 2023, providing growth opportunities 
and retaining critical knowledge and talent.
We believe that helping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to 
our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve. We support employees with easily accessible learning 
resources to help build skills for today and the future. Oracle employees received more than three 
million hours of training in ﬁscal 2023 and accessed online learning content at an average rate of more 
than two million views per month. Our employees take advantage of online classes and learning 
resources on business, leadership and technical skills, as well as webinars and learning opportunities 
that are designed to support employee and family well-being.
Leaders Who Listen
We believe that an important aspect of creating a culture and environment that supports employee, 
customer and business success is listening to employee feedback. We share the results of our annual 
employee engagement survey with leaders who receive direct observations from employees about areas 
critical to Oracle’s strategic priorities, including the employee and customer experience. The results of 
the survey are also discussed with our Board of Directors and committees thereof. In ﬁscal 2023, 81% of 
our employees participated in the annual survey. Leaders listen to employees, evaluate feedback and 
prioritize actions to enhance employee, business and customer success.
Making a Diﬀerence
Each year, through our volunteering and giving programs, Oracle employees donate tens of thousands 
of volunteer hours and millions of dollars (matched by Oracle) to a wide variety of causes. Oracle and 
our employees also rise to the occasion in times of crisis. During ﬁscal 2023, through employee 
donations and Oracle’s matching contributions, we raised more than $1 million for disaster relief and 
recovery in response to earthquakes in Turkey, hurricanes in the United States and other natural 
disasters. 
Oracle also contributes tens of millions of dollars annually to protect the natural world and wildlife, 
advance education and strengthen communities. Among our recent commitments is a $1 million multi-
year grant to The National Museum of African American History and Culture, a Smithsonian Institution 
museum located in Washington, D.C.
Oracle is committed to being at the forefront of positive social impact through initiatives focused on 
education, the environment and community. Our philanthropic education initiatives, Oracle Academy and 
the Oracle Education Foundation, help students develop the skills they need to become technology 
innovators and leaders. Oracle also hosts Design Tech High School, a public charter school, at our 
Redwood Shores, California campus.

Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our quarterly revenues have historically been aﬀected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the 
structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the IT industry. In each 
ﬁscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth ﬁscal quarter 
and lowest in our ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter. See “Cloud and License Business” in Item 7 of this Annual Report for 
more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues, expenses and margins of our 
cloud and license business, which is our largest business.
Competition
We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a 
competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as ﬁrms emerge, expand or are acquired, as 
technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.
Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, 
integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments. Our enterprise cloud, license and 
hardware oﬀerings compete directly with certain oﬀerings from some of the largest and most 
competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, International 
Business Machines Corporation, Intel Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Adobe Systems Incorporated, 
Alphabet Inc., Salesforce, Inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise 
and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new 
technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our oﬀerings. Our 
competitors range from companies oﬀering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to 
vendors providing point solutions, or oﬀerings focused on a speciﬁc functionality, product area or 
industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we 
compete with existing competitors, as well as ﬁrms that may be partners in other areas of our business 
and other ﬁrms with whom we have not previously competed. For example, following our acquisition of 
Cerner, we also face competition from large healthcare IT providers such as Epic Systems Corporation, 
Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Arcadia Solutions, athenahealth, Inc. and InterSystems Corporation, 
among others. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions—including 
acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lines—which invite even greater 
competition in one or more product oﬀering categories. 
Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the 
future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, 
eﬃciency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our products and services 
sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also 
directly and indirectly aﬀected by the following, among other factors:
•market adoption of cloud-based IT oﬀerings, including SaaS and cloud infrastructure oﬀerings; 
•the ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services 
oﬀerings;
•compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and 
public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle Cloud environments;
•the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors;
•the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and 
the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;
•operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with 
alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems;
•the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software 
customers;
•products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staﬀ;

•products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, 
systems integrators or other third parties; and
•the attractiveness of oﬀerings from business processing outsourcers.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, 
many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well 
as our discussion in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations, highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should 
carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.
Business and Operational Risks
We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products and services, integrating 
acquired products and services and enhancing our existing products and services.   Rapid 
technological advances, intense competition, changing delivery models and evolving standards in 
computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and 
increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or suﬃciently 
diﬀerentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product oﬀerings and support services in 
a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not 
purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud oﬀerings or renew license support, hardware 
support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to our future 
success. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to 
develop new products will allow us to compete eﬀectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.
We have continued to refresh and release new oﬀerings of our cloud products and services. Machine 
learning and AI are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if they fail to operate as 
anticipated or our other products do not perform as promised, our business and reputation may be 
harmed.
In addition, our business may be adversely aﬀected if:
•we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the 
anticipated time frames;
•infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in 
greater costs than anticipated;
•we are unable to increase our existing data center capacity or establish data centers in new 
geographic locations in a timely manner to meet current or expected customer demand;
•we fail to meet our contractual service level commitments;
•there is a delay in market acceptance of and diﬃculty in transitioning new and existing 
customers to new, enhanced or acquired product lines or services;
•sanctions, export controls or other regulatory, legislative or other barriers prevent us from 
serving certain customers or restrict our customers from operating in speciﬁc jurisdictions;
•there are changes in IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or timely address with our 
product development eﬀorts;
•we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner; or
17
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
•we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.
In addition, our proﬁtability and revenues could be adversely impacted if we lost one or more of our key 
customers for any reason, including as a result of any of the factors discussed above. Any such loss 
could also limit or reduce our growth in future periods.
If we do not successfully execute our Oracle Cloud strategy, including our oﬀerings of Oracle 
Cloud Services, our revenues and proﬁtability may decline.   We provide our cloud and other 
oﬀerings to customers worldwide via a variety of deployment models, including via our cloud-based 
SaaS and OCI oﬀerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete 
eﬀectively, generate signiﬁcant revenues or maintain the proﬁtability of our cloud oﬀerings. Additionally, 
the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models oﬀered by us and our competitors may 
unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license oﬀerings. If we do not successfully execute our 
cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a 
cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and proﬁtability could decline.
As customer demand for our cloud oﬀerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues 
and operating results due to the diﬀerences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license 
and on-premise license, and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud oﬀering 
arrangements. Customers predominantly purchase our cloud oﬀerings on a subscription basis and 
revenues from these oﬀerings are generally recognized ratably or as services are consumed over the 
terms of the subscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud 
oﬀerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in 
contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are 
generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In 
addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transitions from or be able to suﬃciently 
backﬁll reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support oﬀerings relative to the 
expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could 
adversely aﬀect our revenues and proﬁtability.
As a part of our Oracle Cloud strategy, we plan our investment levels based on estimates of future 
revenues and future anticipated rates of growth. In recent periods, our cloud services and license 
support expenses have grown to meet current and expected demand for our cloud oﬀerings, including 
investments to increase our existing data center capacity and to establish data centers in new 
geographic locations. In connection with these investments, we entered, and expect to continue to 
enter, into long-term operating lease commitments with third party data center providers that generally 
require us to pay signiﬁcant contract termination fees to early exit such obligations should our strategies 
change, which could adversely impact our proﬁtability and cash ﬂows. In addition, we outﬁt these data 
centers with equipment and improvements that we typically depreciate over their estimated useful lives, 
which could be shortened should our cloud strategies change, which could adversely aﬀect our 
proﬁtability.
Our products and services may not function properly if we experience signiﬁcant coding, 
manufacturing or conﬁguration errors in our cloud, license and hardware oﬀerings.   Despite 
testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and 
hardware oﬀerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or conﬁguration errors that can impact 
their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and 
correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware oﬀerings can be time consuming and 
costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware oﬀerings could aﬀect their ability to properly function, 
integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware oﬀerings, could result in service interruptions, 
delays or outages of our cloud oﬀerings, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, 
could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or 
services, and could adversely aﬀect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third-
party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience any of these errors, or if 
there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware oﬀerings or new versions of these oﬀerings, 
our sales could be aﬀected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations 
as well as cloud and other services that we oﬀer to our customers on our products and networks. 
Therefore, any ﬂaws could aﬀect our and our customers’ abilities to conduct business operations and to 
ensure accuracy in ﬁnancial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs and 
interruptions. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware oﬀerings and related 
services to run their businesses, and errors in our cloud, license and hardware oﬀerings and related 
services

could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as signiﬁcant harm to our 
brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.
If we are unable to compete eﬀectively, the results of operations and prospects for our 
business could be harmed.   We face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of 
the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as ﬁrms emerge, expand or 
are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Our enterprise cloud, license and 
hardware oﬀerings compete directly with certain oﬀerings from some of the largest and most 
competitive companies in the world. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market 
segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our 
oﬀerings. We believe many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and 
market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases, middleware products, 
application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence, 
compute, storage and networking products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications and 
infrastructure oﬀerings. 
In addition, use of our competitors’ technologies can inﬂuence a customer’s purchasing decision or 
create an environment that makes it less eﬃcient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services. 
For example, we oﬀer our customers multicloud services whereby our customers can combine cloud 
services from multiple clouds with the goal of optimizing cost, functionality and performance. OCI’s 
multicloud services work with a number of our competitors’ products, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon 
Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. This multicloud strategy could lead our customers to migrate 
away from our cloud oﬀerings to our competitors’ products, which could adversely aﬀect our revenues 
and proﬁtability.
Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing 
products and services on terms that we may not generally ﬁnd acceptable, which may convince 
customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose customers if our competitors 
introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, 
better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, oﬀer more ﬂexible business practices, provide 
debt or equity ﬁnancing to customers or form strategic alliances with other companies. Mergers, 
consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or acquisitions of our competitors by large 
companies may result in increased competition. 
If our competitors oﬀer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the 
marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and 
oﬀerings or oﬀer other terms that are less favorable to us, in order to compete successfully. Any such 
changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely aﬀect operating results. Additionally, 
the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models oﬀered by us and our competitors may unfavorably 
impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services oﬀerings, and we may also 
incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our 
infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and proﬁtability. Our license support fees and 
hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new 
hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may oﬀer lower pricing on their support oﬀerings, 
which could put pressure on us to further discount our oﬀerings.
Changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our 
sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors 
may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy, commit to large 
customer deployments at prices that are unproﬁtable, or provide guarantees of prices and product 
implementations. These practices could, over time, signiﬁcantly constrain the prices that we can charge 
for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reﬂect changes in customer use of 
our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source 
software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.
Any failure to oﬀer high-quality technical support services may adversely aﬀect our 
relationships with our customers and our ﬁnancial results.   Our customers depend on our 
support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure oﬀerings. 
We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer 
demand for support services or may be ineﬃcient in our resolution of customer support issues. 
Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs 
and adversely aﬀect our operating results. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a 
market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely aﬀect our 
reputation,

our ability to sell and renew our applications and infrastructure oﬀerings to existing and prospective 
customers, and our business, operating results, and ﬁnancial position.
Our cloud oﬀerings and hardware oﬀerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully 
manage this complexity, including the sourcing of technologies and components, the results 
of these businesses will suﬀer.   We depend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a 
timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and 
sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud oﬀerings, 
and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due 
to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations could 
be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, 
political unrest, public health crises, changes to trade laws or regulations, port stoppages or other 
transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors aﬀecting the countries or regions where these 
single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped (such as the 
tensions between China and Taiwan). If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and 
license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely 
aﬀected.
Supply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our 
hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some 
instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher purchases and balances of hardware 
products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure 
to deliver our cloud oﬀerings, relative to our historical positions. While this permits us to secure 
manufacturing capacity, it has increased excess and obsolescence risk of such hardware products and 
could adversely impact our proﬁtability and cash ﬂows. We expect these factors will continue to impact 
us in the future.
We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain 
component designs for, our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located 
outside the U.S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems, delays or cannot 
meet our demand for products. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of 
additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of 
which could adversely aﬀect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. 
These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.
Our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.   We are 
currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to 
our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in 
strategies, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. These types of restructurings 
have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced 
productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. These types of 
restructurings may also lead to a shortage of suﬃciently skilled employees in certain roles. In addition, 
we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings beneﬁts of 
these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These eﬀects could recur in 
connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings, and our revenues and other results of 
operations could be negatively aﬀected.
We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualiﬁed employees.   We rely 
on hiring qualiﬁed employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our 
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Oﬃcer and founder; our Chief Executive Oﬃcer; 
other members of our executive team; and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is 
substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and 
other personnel. Hiring freezes or slowdowns may result in decreased productivity while existing 
employees take on additional roles and responsibilities, and may also lead to a shortage of suﬃciently 
skilled employees in certain roles. 
We recently updated our on-site attendance expectations, which may vary by line of business and 
location. A transition away from our hybrid work model to on-site work requirements could result in 
employee dissatisfaction and attrition, and could also lead to increased employee burnout or negatively 
impact employee productivity. Many of our employees will continue to work from home some or all of the 
time. While we believe this has helped us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain 
employees who want or need more ﬂexibility, it may fail 
20

to yield these desired beneﬁts and it may present cybersecurity risks and additional risks for our real 
estate portfolio and strategy. Despite our eﬀorts to reopen our oﬃces in a safe manner, our employees 
who have opted to return to the oﬃce may nevertheless be exposed to health risks, which may expose 
us to potential liability. 
We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not oﬀset by either improved 
productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and 
motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-
competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle 
over the years for a variety of reasons, and any future departures may be disruptive to our operations.
We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced 
technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our 
workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the beneﬁt of a more 
eﬃcient workforce structure. We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these 
countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has aﬀected our employee retention eﬀorts 
and increased our expenses in an eﬀort to oﬀer a competitive compensation program. In addition, 
changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and 
professional talent.
Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units and performance-based equity, which 
are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs 
poorly, it may adversely aﬀect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our 
compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of 
employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting 
alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain 
employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our 
compensation practices or those of our competitors could aﬀect our ability to retain and motivate 
existing personnel and recruit new personnel.
There are risks associated with our cloud and license and hardware indirect sales channels 
which could aﬀect our future operating results.   Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect 
channel networks are comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, 
education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. 
Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and 
hardware marketing and sales eﬀorts. Our ﬁnancial results could be adversely aﬀected if: 
•our contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel 
participants were to deteriorate;
•any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a signiﬁcant channel 
participant; 
•the ﬁnancial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken; or 
•the level of demand for our channel participants’ products and services were to decrease. 
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our 
relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, 
customers and revenues.
Acquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the ﬁnancial and strategic goals 
that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.   We review and consider strategic 
acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active 
acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions 
have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with 
our acquisition program include:
•our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by 
acquisition, transition or integration activities;
•we may have diﬃculties (1) managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; 
(2) entering new markets where we have no, or limited, direct prior experience or where 
competitors may have stronger market positions; or (3) retaining key personnel from the 
acquired companies;
•an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an 
acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected, we may impose our business 
practices or alter 
21

go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or 
otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, each or all of which could 
adversely aﬀect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that 
we recorded as a part of an acquisition, including intangible assets and goodwill;
•our operating results or ﬁnancial condition may be adversely impacted by (1) claims or liabilities 
that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an 
acquisition; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired company, 
the termination or modiﬁcation of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; and (3) 
unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired 
company’s business practices;
•we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other 
circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology;
•we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of 
reasons, including (1) if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew or 
terminate their contracts with the acquired company; (2) if we are unable to sell the acquired 
products or service oﬀerings to our customer base; (3) if acquired customers do not elect to 
purchase our technologies due to diﬀering business practices; or (4) if contract models utilized by 
an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues in a manner that is consistent with 
our current accounting practices;
•we may have diﬃculty integrating acquired technologies, products, services and their related 
supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and related infrastructures;
•we may have multiple product lines or services oﬀerings as a result of our acquisitions that are 
oﬀered, priced, delivered and supported diﬀerently, which could cause customer confusion and 
delays;
•we may incur higher than anticipated costs (1) to support, develop and deliver acquired products 
or services; (2) for general and administrative functions that support new business models; or (3) 
to comply with regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we 
had anticipated;
•we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, 
restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies 
under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition;
•we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition 
and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, and we may need to divest or dispose of assets or 
businesses or take other actions in order to obtain such approvals;
•our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash;
•we incurred additional debt to ﬁnance our acquisition of Cerner in ﬁscal 2023 and in the future, 
we may have to incur additional debt to pay for other acquisitions or have to delay or not 
proceed with an acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition 
in a timely manner or on favorable terms; and
•we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our 
acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including arrangements 
that we may assume in an acquisition.
The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of 
operations, ﬁnancial condition or cash ﬂows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several 
concurrent acquisitions.
If we or our customers are unable to operate our respective businesses as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic (or any resurgence of the pandemic), our future results of operations 
could be harmed.   The COVID-19 pandemic and eﬀorts to control its spread have aﬀected, and any 
spread or resurgence of COVID-19 variants may in the future aﬀect, how we and our customers, partners 
and suppliers operate our businesses. Our operations have been and may in the future be negatively 
aﬀected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control, 
including preventative measures and other related governmental measures. If we are not able to 
respond to and manage future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic eﬀectively, our business will be 
harmed. In addition, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy 
and related impacts on our business and our customers’ business operations remains uncertain and 
cannot be predicted. Additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise, and the 
COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section.

Data Privacy, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property Risks
If our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our 
data, our customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or 
improperly modiﬁed, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand 
and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be 
disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, any of which could 
reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and 
regulatory actions.   Our products and services, including Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, 
manipulate and manage third-party data, such as our customers’ information and data, as well as our 
own data. We believe that Oracle in particular is a target for computer hackers and other bad actors 
because Oracle stores and processes large amounts of data, including in customer sectors involving 
particularly sensitive data such as health sciences (including patient health information), ﬁnancial 
services, retail, hospitality and the government. We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to 
attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated 
organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation-states and individuals sponsored by them) 
to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, 
and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’, partners’ and suppliers’ software, hardware and 
cloud oﬀerings, networks and systems. Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to 
the compromise of personal information or the conﬁdential information or data of Oracle or our 
customers. Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related viruses, worms, and other malicious 
software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security 
vulnerabilities of networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions and cause 
shutdowns or denials of service. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, 
employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other 
information in order to gain access to our data, our customers’, suppliers’ or partners’ data or the IT 
systems of Oracle, our customers, suppliers or partners. Our products and services, including our Oracle 
Cloud Services, may also be accessed or modiﬁed improperly as a result of customer, partner, 
employee, contractor or supplier error or malfeasance.
If a cyber-attack or other security incident results in unauthorized access to or modiﬁcation of our 
customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, our own data or our IT systems, or if the services we 
provide to our customers are disrupted, or if our products or services are reported to have (or are 
perceived as having) security vulnerabilities, we could incur signiﬁcant expenses and suﬀer substantial 
damage to our brand and reputation. If our customers lose conﬁdence in the security and reliability of 
our products and services, including our cloud oﬀerings, and perceive them to not be secure, they may 
decide to reduce or terminate their spend with us. In addition, cyber-attacks and other security incidents 
could lead to considerable investigation and remediation costs, loss or destruction of information, 
interruption of our operations, inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity 
obligations, regulatory investigations and ﬁnancial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability, 
including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notiﬁcation and fraud monitoring. Our 
remediation eﬀorts may not be successful. 
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems, change 
frequently, grow more complex over time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, 
we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques. Our 
internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies. However, 
our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new 
threats emerge. We may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a signiﬁcant period 
of time after the security breach.
Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on a wide variety of third-party products, 
components and services. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a 
security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, 
reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. We also have an active acquisition 
program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. 
While we make signiﬁcant eﬀorts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired 
companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle.

Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, 
liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or 
industry standards relating to privacy and data protection.   As regulatory focus on privacy 
issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal 
information expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection and use within 
our business will intensify. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering 
enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations, 
in a manner that could signiﬁcantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners 
and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer (including across national borders) and 
share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. Our acquisition of 
Cerner during ﬁscal 2023 also subjects us to additional data privacy and other related regulations 
governing the healthcare industry and patient information, including but not limited to regulations 
governing electronic health data transmissions, the processing of patient information, healthcare fraud 
and healthcare information sharing.
Following the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the rate of global 
consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased, giving rise to more global jurisdictions in 
which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if we are not deemed to be in 
compliance, could result in enforcement actions and/or ﬁnes. This is true in the U.S. where, for example, 
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia have enacted privacy laws, the U.S. Congress is 
considering several privacy and security-related bills at the federal level, the federal government is 
pursuing a range of cybersecurity initiatives pertaining to critical infrastructure companies and 
government contractors, and a number of other state legislatures are considering privacy laws. 
Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary ﬁnes for privacy violations. The GDPR provides 
for monetary penalties of up to 4% of an organization’s worldwide revenue. These penalties can be 
signiﬁcant. For example, multiple U.S.-based technology companies have been ﬁned between €225 
million and €1.2 billion for alleged GDPR violations. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to ﬁne 
companies for unfair and deceptive data protection practices, and these ﬁnes may increase in size. 
Taken together, the laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other 
types of data could greatly increase the size of potential ﬁnes related to data protection, and our cost of 
providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us 
from oﬀering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have implemented 
contracts, diligence programs, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, 
data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts, policies and 
procedures. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information 
can shift rapidly, in ways that may aﬀect our reputation or inﬂuence regulators to enact regulations and 
laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products and services.
We make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy, 
information provided on our website and press statements. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to 
comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, 
including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public 
perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted 
business, proceedings, actions or ﬁnes brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, 
or could adversely aﬀect our business and harm our reputation.
Third parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of 
intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.   We periodically 
receive notices from, or have lawsuits ﬁled against us by, third parties claiming infringement or other 
misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third 
parties include entities that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that 
acquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of monetization through infringement assertions. We 
expect to continue to receive such claims as:
•we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies;
•the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows;
•the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in 
the industry;
•the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and
24
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
•non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry 
segments.
Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: 
•be time consuming, costly and result in litigation;
•divert management’s time and attention from developing our business;
•require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we 
would not normally ﬁnd acceptable;
•require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products;
•require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms;
•require us to satisfy indemniﬁcation obligations to our customers; or
•otherwise adversely aﬀect our business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition or cash ﬂows.
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.   We rely on copyright, 
trademark, patent and trade secret laws, conﬁdentiality procedures, controls and contractual 
commitments to protect our intellectual property. Despite our eﬀorts, these protections may be limited. 
Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our 
intellectual property. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Any of our pending or future 
patent applications may not be issued with the claim scope we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of 
some countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as U.S. laws and courts. 
If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use, or other 
misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.
We may not receive signiﬁcant revenues from our current research and development eﬀorts 
for several years, if at all.   Developing our various product oﬀerings is expensive and the investment 
in the development of these oﬀerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important 
element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a signiﬁcant amount of resources to 
research and development and related product and service opportunities, both through internal 
investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from acquired companies. Accelerated product 
and service introductions and short lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and 
development that could adversely aﬀect our operating results if not oﬀset by revenue increases. We 
believe that we must continue to dedicate a signiﬁcant amount of resources to our research and 
development eﬀorts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive 
signiﬁcant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Adverse litigation results could aﬀect our business.   We are subject to various legal proceedings. 
Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management’s 
attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with 
certainty. Even a favorable judgment may be subject to appeals leading to protracted litigation, 
additional costs and the prospect that our desired outcome will be overturned. An adverse decision 
could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could aﬀect our business, operating results or 
ﬁnancial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is 
discussed under Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this 
Annual Report.
We may be subjected to increased taxes due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws or 
from adverse resolutions of tax audits and controversies.   As a multinational corporation, we 
incur income taxes as well as non-income based taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, property and value-
added taxes) in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Signiﬁcant uncertainties exist with 
respect to the application of the various taxes to the businesses in which we engage, often requiring 
that we make judgments in determining our tax liabilities and worldwide provision for income taxes. We 
are regularly under audit by tax authorities in the U.S. and internationally, which has led to 
disagreements regarding our treatment of various items, including our intercompany transfer prices and 
calculations and the applicability of withholding taxes to our cross-border transactions. Any unfavorable 
resolution of these tax audits and controversies could cause our tax liabilities to increase and may have 
a material and adverse impact on our provision for income taxes and eﬀective tax rate. Although we 
believe that our income and non-income based 
25
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the ﬁnal determination of tax audits or disputes 
will not be diﬀerent from what is reﬂected in our historical income tax provisions and tax accruals.
Countries around the world continually consider and make changes to relevant tax, accounting and 
other laws, treaties, regulations, guidance and interpretations. In the U.S., certain enacted and proposed 
legislation may substantially raise U.S. income taxes on our domestic and international proﬁts. Such 
unfavorable tax legislation resulting from the shifting U.S. political landscape and economic environment 
create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have a 
material adverse impact on our future income tax provisions and eﬀective tax rate.
Other countries also continue to consider changes to their tax laws that could negatively aﬀect us by 
increasing taxes imposed on our international revenue streams, operations and cross-border 
transactions, including the imposition of taxes targeted at digital technology businesses and changes in 
withholding tax rules. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G20 
have developed a two-pillar framework that would provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions 
where customers or users are located and implement a 15% global minimum tax on multinational 
corporate groups. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the 
OECD’s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering 
changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s two-pillar framework. These changes may 
materially increase the level of income tax on our international proﬁts.
Our future income tax provisions and eﬀective tax rate could materially increase under the tax changes 
discussed above or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other 
countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely aﬀected by 
changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions with diﬀering statutory tax rates, 
ﬂuctuations in our stock price and level of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation 
of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.
Our international sales and operations and global customer base subject us to additional 
risks that can adversely aﬀect our operating results.   We derive a substantial portion of our 
revenues from, and have signiﬁcant operations, outside of the U.S., and in both our U.S. and non-U.S. 
operations we serve customers based in or with ties to numerous jurisdictions around the world. 
Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations 
increases our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, 
labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition/antitrust regulations, 
anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental oﬃcials such as the U.S. Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariﬀs, and import, export and general trade 
regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and 
regulations could result in monetary ﬁnes, civil and/or criminal penalties, enforcement actions against 
us, our oﬃcers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including 
disgorgement, the loss of trade privileges, and other remedial measures. Any such violations could result 
in prohibitions on our ability to oﬀer our products and services in one or more countries or territories or 
to certain entities, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our 
reputation, our brand, our international expansion eﬀorts, our ability to attract and retain employees, 
our business and our operating results. 
Changes to sanctions or export control regulations in the U.S. and the other jurisdictions where we 
currently operate or have dealings, or in the future may operate or have dealings, can require 
suspension or termination of business, including ﬁnancial transactions, in certain countries, territories or 
with certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial 
condition and results of operations. For example, in March 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
and the imposition of economic sanctions and export controls targeting Russia by the U.S., EU and other 
countries, we withdrew our operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. We 
continue to monitor relations between the U.S. and the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus and 
the People’s Republic of China, among others. It is diﬃcult to anticipate the eﬀect such relations may 
have on us. Compliance with any further economic sanctions, export controls or other regulatory 
restrictions (and any retaliatory responses thereto) taken by the U.S. or other countries could prevent us 
from serving certain customers or restrict our customers from operating in speciﬁc jurisdictions, which 
could have an adverse eﬀect on our operations and results of operations. Compliance with these laws 
may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our 
compliance eﬀorts. 
26

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these diﬃculties. We 
monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way 
in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and 
report our ﬁndings to government authorities, and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their 
own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be 
given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove 
eﬀective.
We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating 
globally, including those related to: 
•general economic conditions in each country or region;
•political unrest, terrorism and war, including but not limited to the current Russia-Ukraine war, 
the economic impact thereof and the potential to subject our business to materially adverse 
consequences should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other 
potential impacts, the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe, where 
a material portion of our business is carried out;
•the potential for other hostilities, including but not limited to escalating tensions between China 
and Taiwan;
•public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in 
which we have signiﬁcant operations;
•ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our 
operating results;
•diﬃculties in accessing or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries 
that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular our cash assets, in that country’s 
currency;
•regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may 
not be able to suﬃciently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other 
cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be 
required to pay in these countries;
•common local business behaviors or regulatory requirements that conﬂict with our business 
ethics, practices and conduct policies;
•longer payment cycles and diﬃculties in collecting accounts receivable;
•overlapping tax regimes; and
•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.
The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our 
supply chain operations and sales of our products and services in aﬀected countries or regions.
As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in 
India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly traded company in Japan, we face several additional 
risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we 
would otherwise have if these entities were wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Our sales to local, state, federal and foreign government customers expose us to business 
volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, procurement 
regulations, governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, 
investigations, sanctions and penalties.   We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. 
government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement 
laws relating to the award, administration and performance of those contracts.
Governmental entities are variously pursuing policies that aﬀect our ability to sell our products and 
services. Changes in government procurement policy, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives 
and/or requirements may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector. For 
example, the U.S. government imposes evolving cybersecurity requirements, including, for example, the 
FedRAMP authorization process and the Department of Defense (DoD) Cybersecurity Maturity Model 
Certiﬁcation. These requirements may impact our lines of business in the U.S. federal government 
market. Compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly, and failure to meet, or 
delays in meeting, the required security controls could limit our ability to sell 
27
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
products and services, directly or indirectly, to the DoD and other federal and state government entities 
that implement similar cybersecurity requirements.
We are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to 
terminate contracts at any time for a variety of reasons, including without cause. For example, the U.S. 
federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its 
convenience, or for default based on our performance. U.S. federal, state and local government and 
foreign government contracts are generally subject to government funding 
authorizations/appropriations. Contracts may also be terminated due to a lack of government funds.
There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, 
to reduce spending as governments continue to face signiﬁcant deﬁcit reduction pressures. This may 
adversely impact spending on government programs.
Government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to 
audits and investigations. If violations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties 
and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, 
forfeiture of proﬁts, suspension of payments, ﬁnes and suspensions or debarment from future 
government business.
Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and 
could result in signiﬁcant liabilities and costs.   Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to 
state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and 
disposal of materials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical 
substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labeling requirements. 
Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase 
our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and 
administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change 
our sales activities, or otherwise impact future ﬁnancial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. 
Any violation of these laws can subject us to signiﬁcant liability, including ﬁnes, penalties and possible 
prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a 
material adverse eﬀect on the ﬁnancial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware 
businesses. Regulatory, market, and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and 
energy mix for our data center operations may also grow.
A signiﬁcant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, 
such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for 
Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, among others, may increase our cost of 
doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other 
countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these 
requirements. 
We have an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC) comprised of senior individuals from a wide range 
of Oracle business units, including our Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer who oversees our overall sustainability 
strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks 
have the potential for signiﬁcant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, 
including service delivery and support, product development and deployment, supply chain 
management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention, or brand reputation. A failure by 
the ESC to identify and assess these risks could adversely aﬀect our reputation, business, ﬁnancial 
performance and growth. 
We publish an annual Social Impact Report, which includes disclosure of our Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) matters and goals. Our disclosures on these matters, and standards we set for 
ourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may potentially harm our reputation and brand. By 
electing to set and share publicly these corporate ESG standards, our business may also face increased 
scrutiny related to ESG activities.
Further, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, including 
sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized in the 
U.S., Europe and elsewhere, which may require speciﬁc, target-driven frameworks or disclosure 
requirements. For example, in the U.S., the SEC has proposed rules requiring, among other things, 
disclosure of public companies’ climate-related strategies, costs, 
28
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
impacts and targets. Standards for reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be 
required by the SEC or other regulators, are complex and evolving, and the implementation and 
oversight of controls to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure standards could impose 
signiﬁcant compliance costs. In addition, such disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our 
previous ESG-related disclosure or challenges in meeting evolving and varied regulatory and other 
stakeholder expectations and standards, which could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and 
prospects.
Financial Risks
Our operations can be diﬃcult for us to predict because our quarterly results of operations 
may ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly based on a number of factors.   Our revenues, particularly certain of 
our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be diﬃcult to forecast. A 
substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the 
latter part of a quarter. Because a signiﬁcant portion of our cost structure is largely ﬁxed in the short 
term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our proﬁtability. 
The number of large license transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products transactions 
increases the risk of ﬂuctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of 
these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and proﬁtability to fall signiﬁcantly short of 
our predictions. In addition, sudden shifts in regional or global economic or political activity may cause 
our sales forecasts to be inaccurate.
In addition, we hold a portfolio of publicly traded and privately held equity investments. Changes in the 
fair values of these investments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of 
consolidated net income in each period. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these 
investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of 
the companies or funds in which we invest. Changes in the fair values of these investments are also 
subject to the general conditions of public and private equity markets, which are uncertain and have in 
the past varied, and may in the future vary, materially by period. Changes in the fair values of these 
investments have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to volatility in our net income that is 
not reﬂective of our core businesses.
Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely aﬀect customer demand and our revenue 
and proﬁtability.   We conduct a signiﬁcant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other 
than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the Australian Dollar, 
British Pound, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal, relative 
to the U.S. Dollar can signiﬁcantly aﬀect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash ﬂows, 
which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of 
the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely aﬀects our 
revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign 
currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain 
of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to 
purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely aﬀect margins on sales of our products in 
countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our reported revenues and operating results are adversely 
aﬀected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively aﬀected when the 
dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely aﬀected when the dollar 
strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among 
other assets, are held in foreign currencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.
In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees 
and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the 
near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily 
utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to oﬀset the risks associated with certain foreign 
currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As part of this program, we enter 
into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures 
are oﬀset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an eﬀort to 
mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large 
portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize 
gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign 
currency forward contracts, including the cost to obtain such contracts. For example, we will experience 
29
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-eﬀective to hedge our 
foreign currency exposures, if our hedging eﬀorts are ineﬀective, or should we suspend our foreign 
currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency 
ﬂuctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, 
the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we 
have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to oﬀset these exposures and any related fees paid 
to purchase such contracts, and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of 
operations, ﬁnancial position and cash ﬂows.
We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly 
inﬂationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. We could incur future losses in emerging market 
countries and other countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as 
highly inﬂationary. 
There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.   As of May 31, 2023, 
we had an aggregate of $90.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar 
year 2023 and calendar year 2061. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our 
indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate suﬃcient cash 
ﬂows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this Risk Factors section. There can be no 
assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
We may also need to reﬁnance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we 
may not be able to reﬁnance existing debt or that the terms of any reﬁnancing may not be as favorable 
as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of 
reﬁnancing result in higher interest rates upon reﬁnancing, then the interest expense relating to that 
reﬁnanced indebtedness would increase.
Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax 
credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably aﬀect our 
provision for income taxes and eﬀective tax rate. In addition, changes to our outlook or credit rating or a 
withdrawal by any rating agency could negatively aﬀect the value of both our debt and equity securities 
and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could 
adversely aﬀect our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.   All of the 
factors discussed within this Risk Factors section could aﬀect our stock price. The timing of 
announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new cloud services, 
products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitions or major transactions could also 
aﬀect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of stock repurchases or dividends could 
aﬀect our stock price. Our stock price could also be aﬀected by factors, some of which are beyond our 
control, including, among others: speculation in the press, social media and the analyst community; 
changes in recommendations or earnings related estimates by ﬁnancial analysts; changes in investors’ 
or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock; negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys; 
earnings announcements where our ﬁnancial results diﬀer from our guidance or investors’ expectations; 
our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. The stock market in general, and the 
market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume ﬂuctuations 
that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. A 
signiﬁcant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, 
which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could 
adversely aﬀect our business.
We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it 
will enhance long-term stockholder value.   Our repurchase program does not have an expiration 
date and we are not obligated to repurchase a speciﬁed number or dollar value of shares. Further, our 
stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 
However, we do not expect to increase the amount of stock repurchases until our gross debt is reduced 
below certain thresholds. Even if fully implemented, our stock repurchase program may not enhance 
long-term stockholder value. In addition, the Inﬂation Reduction Act, signed into law on August 16, 2022, 
imposes an excise tax of 1% (potentially increasing to 4% under certain U.S. tax proposals) on certain 
corporate stock repurchases.

General Risks
Economic, political and market conditions can adversely aﬀect our business, results of 
operations and ﬁnancial condition, including our revenue growth and proﬁtability, which in 
turn could adversely aﬀect our stock price.   Our business is inﬂuenced by a range of factors that 
are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include: 
•general economic and business conditions;
•overall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services;
•governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and
•general legal, regulatory and political developments.
Macroeconomic developments such as the global or regional economic eﬀects resulting from increasing 
inﬂation rates, limited liquidity, adverse developments aﬀecting ﬁnancial institutions, the current Russia-
Ukraine war and related economic curtailment initiatives, evolving trade policies between the U.S. and 
international trade partners, or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to 
uncertainty or instability in economic, political or market conditions could negatively aﬀect our business, 
operating results, ﬁnancial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely aﬀect our stock price. 
Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate conﬁdence in, the global economy or the 
curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce 
or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel 
purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for 
previously purchased products and services. If any parties with whom we conduct business or invest our 
cash or cash equivalents are unable to meet their obligations to us, our business could be adversely 
aﬀected. Bank failures or issues in the broader U.S. or global ﬁnancial systems may have an impact on 
the broader capital markets and, in turn, our ability to access those markets.
In addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global 
stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, public 
health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political 
uncertainty that could adversely aﬀect our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, including our 
revenue growth and proﬁtability. These factors generally have the strongest eﬀect on our sales of cloud 
license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may aﬀect 
our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud oﬀerings.
Business disruptions could adversely aﬀect our operating results.   A signiﬁcant portion of our 
critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas, some of which include emerging 
market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations 
solely within the U.S. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, 
supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, including some 
of our cloud oﬀerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing 
back-oﬃce processes. A major natural disaster, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that 
supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the eﬀects of climate change (such as increased 
storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical 
business operations, supply chains or IT systems could severely aﬀect our ability to conduct normal 
business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely 
aﬀected.

Item 2.Properties
Our properties consist of owned and leased oﬃce facilities for sales, support, research and development, 
services, manufacturing, cloud operations and administrative and other functions. Our headquarters 
facility consists of approximately 0.9 million square feet in Austin, Texas, all of which we own. We also 
own or lease other facilities for current use consisting of approximately 29.2 million square feet in 
various other locations in the U.S. and abroad. Approximately 9.6 million square feet, or 32%, of our total 
owned and leased space is sublet or is being actively marketed for sublease or disposition. We lease our 
principal internal manufacturing facility for our hardware products in Hillsboro, Oregon. Our cloud 
operations deliver our Oracle Cloud Services through the use of global data centers, substantially all of 
which were leased through colocation suppliers. We believe that our facilities are in good condition and 
suitable for the conduct of our business.

Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of 
May 31, 2023, approximately $8.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock 
repurchase program. 
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase 
activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions 
and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and 
economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be eﬀected from time to time through 
open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may 
be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May 31, 2023

Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations
We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with 
an overview of our businesses and signiﬁcant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our 
critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the 
assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported ﬁnancial results. We then provide a more 
detailed analysis of our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition for ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 
2022. A discussion regarding our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations for ﬁscal 2022 compared 
to ﬁscal 2021 can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended May 31, 2022, 
as ﬁled with the SEC on June 21, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at 
www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.
Business Overview
Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. 
Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure oﬀerings that are delivered 
worldwide through a variety of ﬂexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include 
on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and 
cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we oﬀer choice and ﬂexibility to our customers and facilitate the 
product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our 
worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including 
businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.
We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single 
operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 
1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual 
Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to 
how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief 
Technology Oﬃcer, view our operating results and allocate resources.
Cloud and License Business 
Our cloud and license business, which represented 83% and 85% of our total revenues in ﬁscal 2023 and 
2022, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and 
infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license oﬀerings. Revenue streams included in our 
cloud and license business are:
•Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:
olicense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to 
customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of 
Oracle applications and infrastructure licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT 
environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with 
us upon expiration in order to continue to beneﬁt from technical support services and the 
periodic issuance of unspeciﬁed updates and enhancements, which current license support 
customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a 
percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-
premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are 
generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably 
over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one 
year; and 
ocloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud 
applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle 
develops, provides unspeciﬁed updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and 
supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a 
stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the 
cloud services being performed; generally have durations of one to three years; are generally 
renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally 
35
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the 
case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time.
•Cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our 
software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, 
among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise or other IT 
environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in 
nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software 
is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty 
arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in 
time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can 
substantially aﬀect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue 
recognition for license transactions, which is diﬀerent than the typical revenue recognition 
pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally 
recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers 
have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.
Providing choice and ﬂexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications 
and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, 
customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle 
Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have 
introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the 
related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the 
Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our 
total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 
32%, 25% and 22% of our total revenues during ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is aﬀected by many factors, including the strength of 
general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and 
competitive position of our oﬀerings; customer satisfaction with our oﬀerings; the continued renewal of 
our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially 
all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license 
purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the 
pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud 
capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate 
ﬂuctuations.
On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will 
continue to increase due to:
•expected growth in our cloud services and license support oﬀerings; and
•continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license oﬀerings.
We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total 
revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and 
our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint 
of our cloud and license products and services.
Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four 
quarters within a particular ﬁscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license 
business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business 
are generally ﬁxed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ 
revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular ﬁscal year is primarily due to the 
addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we 
generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual 
terms and the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the 
course of each ﬁscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the 
historical 
36
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a 
point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four ﬁscal quarterly periods.
Hardware Business 
Our hardware business, which represented 6% and 7% of our total revenues in ﬁscal 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software 
products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-speciﬁc hardware oﬀerings, 
operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related 
hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or 
ﬁrmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance 
obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point 
in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership 
is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve 
existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The 
majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors 
and value-added resellers. Our hardware support oﬀerings provide customers with unspeciﬁed software 
updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and 
associated software products. Our hardware support oﬀerings can also include product repairs, 
maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and 
renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware 
products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are 
delivered over the contractual terms.
We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of 
revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and 
distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. 
Our quarterly hardware revenues are diﬃcult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and 
hardware operating margins that we report are aﬀected by many factors, including our manufacturing 
partners’ abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, with this factor 
becoming more pronounced in recent periods due to global supply chain constraints for certain 
technology components; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to 
competitor oﬀerings; customer demand for competing oﬀerings, including cloud infrastructure oﬀerings; 
the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether 
customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of 
hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its 
support contracts; and the close association between hardware products, which have a ﬁnite life, and 
customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either 
maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are 
available; and foreign currency rate ﬂuctuations.
Services Business 
Our services business, which represented 11% and 8% of our total revenues in ﬁscal 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle 
applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are diﬀerentiated based on 
our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best 
practices. Our services oﬀerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our 
services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services 
revenues are aﬀected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our 
services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware oﬀerings and the related services 
that we may market and sell in connection with these oﬀerings; general economic conditions; 
governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter 
controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate ﬂuctuations.

Acquisitions
Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. 
Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, 
products, services and technologies. We acquired certain companies and technologies during ﬁscal 2023 
and 2022, including Cerner in ﬁscal 2023. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our acquisition of Cerner 
and our other recent acquisitions. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire 
companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy.
We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents 
and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the 
issuance of additional securities. We estimate the ﬁnancial impact of any potential acquisition with 
regard to earnings, operating margin, cash ﬂows and return on invested capital targets, among others, 
before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Our consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting 
Standards Codiﬁcation (ASC), and we consider various staﬀ accounting bulletins and other applicable 
guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, 
judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we 
rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments 
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can aﬀect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the ﬁnancial statements as well as the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are 
diﬀerences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our ﬁnancial 
statements will be aﬀected. The accounting policies that reﬂect our more signiﬁcant estimates, 
judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and 
evaluating our reported ﬁnancial results include:
•Revenue Recognition; 
•Business Combinations;
•Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments;
•Accounting for Income Taxes; and
•Legal and Other Contingencies.
Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the 
Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more discussion of our critical and 
other accounting policies. There were no signiﬁcant changes to our critical accounting policies and 
estimates from the prior year.
Revenue Recognition 
The most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Customers, and 
our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the 
evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation. 
Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in 
determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products 
and services generally function on a standalone basis and do not require a signiﬁcant amount of 
integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services contained within a customer 
contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. 
We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on 
the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each 
38
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to 
each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is 
satisﬁed. 
We use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for 
products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-
premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or 
services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an 
SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and 
circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our 
pricing practices that are inﬂuenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and 
services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not 
historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license 
support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a 
percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the 
SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products 
are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative 
SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a 
cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is 
generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within 
a contract are ﬁrst allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with 
any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.
Business Combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our 
acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of 
assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is deﬁned as an integrated set of assets and 
activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to 
investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual 
assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business 
requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of 
consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where 
applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to reﬁnement. As a result, during the 
measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record 
adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding oﬀset to goodwill. 
Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or ﬁnal determination of the values 
of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes ﬁrst, any subsequent adjustments are 
recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make signiﬁcant estimates and 
assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, pre-
acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that 
the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they 
are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the 
acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
that may aﬀect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the 
acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies 
throughout the measurement period in order to obtain suﬃcient information to assess whether we 
include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.
If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency 
by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we 
will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset 
existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability 
can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent 
39

to the measurement period or ﬁnal determination of the net asset values for the business combination, 
whichever comes ﬁrst, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will aﬀect earnings and could 
have a material eﬀect on our results of operations and ﬁnancial position.
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business 
combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based 
upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our 
preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identiﬁed within the measurement period. 
Subsequent to the measurement period or our ﬁnal determination of the tax allowance’s or 
contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes ﬁrst, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax 
related valuation allowances will aﬀect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of 
operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and ﬁnancial position.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments 
We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine 
our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for 
each of our reporting units.
Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; ﬁnancial 
performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity speciﬁc factors; 
industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors 
aﬀecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value 
of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.
Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a 
reporting unit and involves signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions 
include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future 
cash ﬂows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination 
of appropriate market comparables.
We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased ﬁnite lived intangible assets whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to 
evaluate whether the net book values of our ﬁnite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine 
whether ﬁnite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash ﬂows that 
are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates 
about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and 
include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash ﬂows to be generated by certain asset groupings. 
These assumptions and estimates can be aﬀected by a variety of factors, including external factors such 
as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our 
internal forecasts.
Accounting for Income Taxes 
Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a 
global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is 
uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost 
reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and 
expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic 
earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, 
the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters could be diﬀerent from that which is reﬂected in our historical 
income tax provisions and accruals. Such diﬀerences could have a material eﬀect on our income tax 
provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than 
not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate 
suﬃcient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider 
future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in 
which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the 
law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining 
40

the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to 
realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets 
valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, 
or goodwill would be adjusted at our ﬁnal determination of the valuation allowance related to an 
acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the 
net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously 
provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time.
We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could 
diﬀer from the actual results reﬂected in income tax returns ﬁled during the subsequent year. 
Adjustments based on ﬁled returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are ﬁled 
and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our eﬀective tax rate.
The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax 
authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any 
uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated 
with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business 
Combinations” above. 
For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these 
uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to 
recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The 
ﬁrst step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that 
the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
processes. The second step is to measure the tax beneﬁt as the largest amount that is more than 50% 
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved 
for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the ﬁnal outcome of these 
matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, 
such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and reﬁnement of estimates or realization of earnings 
or deductions that diﬀer from our estimates. To the extent that the ﬁnal outcome of these matters is 
diﬀerent than the amounts recorded, such diﬀerences generally will impact our provision for income 
taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the 
impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include 
the related interest and penalties.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of 
each signiﬁcant matter and assess our potential ﬁnancial exposure. A description of our accounting 
policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under 
“Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business 
combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal 
proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Signiﬁcant judgment 
is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of 
an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are 
based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional 
information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and 
litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could 
have a material impact on our results of operations and ﬁnancial position.

Results of Operations
Impact of Acquisitions
The comparability of our operating results for ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 2022 was impacted by our 
recent acquisitions, including Cerner. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations for ﬁscal 
2023 compared to ﬁscal 2022, we have qualitatively disclosed the impact of our acquired products and 
services subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in operating segments’ revenues where such 
qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that inﬂuenced the 
changes in our results of operations. When material, we have also provided quantitative disclosures 
related to such acquired products and services. The impacts of expense contributions from our recent 
acquisitions subsequent to the acquisition dates generally were not separately identiﬁable due to the 
integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were 
insigniﬁcant to our results of operations during the periods presented.
Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information 
In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, 
total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are 
presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the 
other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly 
attributable to our three businesses.
In addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware 
and services—which are our operating segments as deﬁned pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. 
The ﬁnancial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is 
consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reﬂects revenues, 
direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of 
our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of 
our three businesses in the discussion below.
Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, 
general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible 
assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring 
expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses, net and provision for income taxes are not 
attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of 
our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to “Supplemental 
Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 
14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a 
reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total 
income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for ﬁscal 2023 
and 2022. 
During ﬁscal 2022, we remitted and recorded $4.7 billion for certain litigation related items that we do 
not expect to recur in future periods.
Constant Currency Presentation
Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a signiﬁcant portion 
of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and 
expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be aﬀected by changes in the U.S. Dollar 
against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying 
businesses performed, excluding the eﬀects of foreign currency rate ﬂuctuations, we compare the 
percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant 
currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities 
reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates 
(i.e., the rates in eﬀect on May 31, 2022, which was the last day of our prior ﬁscal year) rather than the 
actual exchange rates in eﬀect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros 
had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2023 and 2022, our ﬁnancial 
statements would reﬂect reported revenues of $1.08 million in ﬁscal 2023 (using 1.08 as the month-end 
average exchange rate for the period) and $1.07 million in ﬁscal 2022 (using 1.07 as the month-end 
average exchange rate for the period).

The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the ﬁscal 2023 results using the ﬁscal 
2022 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of 
the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported 
currency and in constant currency.

Excluding the eﬀects of foreign currency rate ﬂuctuations, our total revenues increased across our three 
businesses during ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022 primarily due to revenue contributions from our 
acquisition of Cerner. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Cerner, the constant currency revenues 
increase during ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022 in our cloud and license business was attributable to 
growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and 
infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and also renewed their related 
cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our 
technologies and to receive support services, partially oﬀset by a decrease in our cloud license and on-
premise license revenues. In our hardware business, the increase during ﬁscal 2023 was primarily due to 
growth in our Oracle Exadata and certain other strategic hardware product oﬀerings. In our services 
business, the increase during ﬁscal 2023 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our 
primary services oﬀerings. 
In reported currency, Cerner contributed $5.9 billion to our total revenues during ﬁscal 2023. In constant 
currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Paciﬁc regions contributed 84%, 10% and 6%, 
respectively, of the constant currency total revenue growth during ﬁscal 2023.
Excluding the eﬀects of foreign currency rate ﬂuctuations, our total operating expenses increased in 
ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022 primarily due to additional operating expenses as a result of our 
acquisition of Cerner, including higher intangible assets amortization; higher cloud services and license 
support expenses, which were primarily due to higher employee related expenses and infrastructure 
investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; higher 
hardware expenses, which were primarily due to incremental hardware product costs related to Cerner’s 
hardware business; higher restructuring expenses; and higher expenses across other operating expense 
categories primarily due to higher employee related expenses. Furthermore, during ﬁscal 2022, we 
recorded gains of $250 million on operating asset sales, which was allocated as a beneﬁt to most of our 
operating expense lines as presented per our consolidated statement of operations and which reduced 
our total operating expenses during the same period. These constant currency expense increases during 
ﬁscal 2023 were

partially oﬀset by the absence of $4.7 billion of litigation related charges that were recorded to 
acquisition related and other expenses during ﬁscal 2022. We do not expect the litigation related 
charges to recur in future periods.
In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues 
increased in ﬁscal 2023, relative to ﬁscal 2022, primarily due to certain litigation related charges noted 
above that increased our operating expenses during ﬁscal 2022.
Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges
To supplement our consolidated ﬁnancial information, we believe that the following information is helpful 
to an overall understanding of our past ﬁnancial performance and prospects for the future. 
Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination 
accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income 
items that aﬀected our GAAP net income:
    Year Ended Ma y 31,  
(in millions)   2023    2022

Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquir ed in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 
31, 2023, estimated futur e amortization r elated to intangible assets was as follows (in millions): 
Fiscal 2024  $ 2,994  
Fiscal 2025    2,283

Total intangible assets, net  $ 9,837  
Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business  
combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measur ement period has ended and certain other operating items,  
net. For ﬁscal 2022, acqu isition related and other expenses also included certain litigation related charges. We consider the litigation  
related charges that are included in this line item to be outside our ordinary course of business based on the following considerations:  
(i) the unprecedented nature of the litigation related charges including the natur e and size of the damages awar ded; (ii) the 
dissimilarity of this litigation and related charges to recurring litigation of which we are a party in our normal business course for which  
any and all such charges are included in our GAAP operating results and are not separately quantiﬁed and disclosed within this line 
item or any other line in the table presented above; (iii) the comple xity of the case; (iv) the counterparty involved; and (v) our 
expectation that litigation r elated char ges of this natur e will not r ecur in futur e periods; among other factors.
Restructuring expenses during ﬁscal 2023 and 2022 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2022 Oracle  
Restructuring Plan (2022 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in 
management’s discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses,” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
included elsewher e in this Annual R eport.
Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolida ted statements of operations (in 
millions):

realignment of our legal entity structur e resulted in an eﬀective tax rate of 16.3%, instead of 6.8%, for ﬁscal 2023 and 16.3%, instead  
of 12.2%, for ﬁscal 2022, which in each case represented our eﬀective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statement of 
operations.  
Cloud and License Business
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure 
technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle license support 
oﬀerings; Oracle Cloud Services oﬀerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license oﬀerings. 
License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure 
license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our 
customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, 
which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a 
subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspeciﬁed updates 
and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally 
recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage 
model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues 
represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our 
database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT 
environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made 
available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place signiﬁcant emphasis, both 
domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market 
certain of our oﬀerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business 
are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These 
costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services 
and license support oﬀerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our 
cloud and license oﬀerings, and marketing program costs.

Excluding the eﬀects of foreign currency rate ﬂuctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues 
increased in ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022 due to growth in our cloud services and license support 
revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license 
deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue 
to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services for which we 
delivered such cloud and support services during the period presented, as well as revenue contributions 
from our Cerner acquisition, partially oﬀset by a decrease in our non-Cerner cloud license and on-
premise license revenues. In reported currency, Cerner contributed $3.6 billion to our cloud and license 
business’ revenues during ﬁscal 2023. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Paciﬁc 
regions contributed 84%, 9% and 7%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this 
business during ﬁscal 2023.
In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in ﬁscal 2023 compared 
to ﬁscal 2022 primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount; higher 
technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; 
and additional operating expenses due to our Cerner acquisition. In addition, an allocation of gains from 
operating asset sales in ﬁscal 2022 decreased our expenses during that period, with no comparable 
transaction in ﬁscal 2023. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent 
periods, and we expect this growth to continue during ﬁscal 2024 as we increase our existing data 
center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and 
expected customer demand.
Excluding the eﬀects of currency rate ﬂuctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin 
increased in ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 2022 due to increases in total revenues for this business. 
Total margin as a percentage of revenues for this business decreased in ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 
2022 due to expenses growth.
Hardware Business
Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, 
server, storage, and industry-speciﬁc hardware oﬀerings. The hardware product and related software, 
such as an operating system or ﬁrmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted 
for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are 
generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and 
ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of 
hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally 
recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual 
term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect 
channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our 
hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware 
business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used 
to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, 
warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the 
impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer 
products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; 
and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable 
compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware oﬀerings.

The increase in our constant currency hardware revenues in ﬁscal 2023 was primarily due to revenue 
contributions from our Cerner acquisition and growth in our Oracle Exadata and certain other strategic 
hardware product oﬀerings, relative to ﬁscal 2022. In reported currency, Cerner contributed $140 million 
to our hardware business’ revenues in ﬁscal 2023. Our hardware business’ revenues were adversely 
impacted during ﬁscal 2023 and 2022 due to the impacts of the global supply chain shortages for 
technology components that resulted in certain manufacturing delays. In constant currency, the 
Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Paciﬁc regions contributed 75%, 16% and 9%, respectively, to the 
revenue growth for this business during ﬁscal 2023.
Excluding the eﬀects of currency rate ﬂuctuations, total hardware expenses increased in ﬁscal 2023 
compared to ﬁscal 2022 primarily due to incremental hardware product costs from Cerner’s hardware 
business, partially oﬀset by lower sales and marketing expenses due to lower headcount.
In constant currency, our hardware business’ total margin increased in ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 
2022 due to higher total revenues for this business. In constant currency, total margin as a percentage

Services Business
Our services oﬀerings are designed to help maximize the performance of customer investments in 
Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies and substantially include our consulting services and 
advanced customer services oﬀerings. Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the 
services are performed.

Excluding the eﬀects of currency rate ﬂuctuations, our total services revenues increased in ﬁscal 2023 
relative to ﬁscal 2022 due to revenue contributions from our Cerner acquisition and revenue increases in 
each of our primary services oﬀerings. In reported currency, Cerner contributed $2.2 billion to our

Asia Paciﬁc regions contributed 86%, 11% and 3%, respectively, to the revenue growth for this business 
during ﬁscal 2023.
In constant currency, total services expenses increased in ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 2022 primarily

Research and Development Expenses:   Research and development expenses consist primarily of 
personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest signiﬁcantly in our research and 
development eﬀorts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive 
position.

from operating asset sales during ﬁscal 2022 decreased our expenses during that period, with no 
comparable transaction in ﬁscal 2023.
Amortization of Intangible Assets:   Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through 
our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, 
the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for 
potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information 
regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.

Excluding the eﬀects of foreign currency rate ﬂuctuations, acquisition related and other expenses 
decreased in ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022 primarily due to the absence of $4.7 billion of litigation 
related charges recorded to acquisition related and other expenses during ﬁscal 2022 that we generally 
do not expect to recur, partially oﬀset by higher transitional employee related costs related to our 
acquisition of Cerner and certain facilities-related right-of-use assets that were abandoned in connection 
with plans to improve our cost structure and operations in ﬁscal 2023.
Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management 
approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or 
operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic 
initiatives. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs, contract termination costs and 
certain other exit costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding 
our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in 
this Annual Report.

Restructuring expenses  $ 490   157%  151% $ 191 
Restructuring expenses in ﬁscal 2023 and 2022 primarily related to our 2022 Restructuring Plan. Our 
management approved, committed to and initiated the 2022 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure 
and further improve eﬃciencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in 
future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs 
associated with existing restructuring plans.
The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2022 Restructuring Plan were eﬀected to implement 
our continued emphasis in developing, marketing, selling and delivering our cloud-based oﬀerings. 
Certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to our 2022 Restructuring Plan initiatives were oﬀset by 
investments in resources and geographies that better address the development, marketing, sale and 
delivery of our cloud-based oﬀerings, including investments in the development and delivery of our 
second-generation cloud infrastructure.

Interest expense  $3,505   27%  27% $2,755 
Interest expense increased in ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 2022 primarily due to higher average 
borrowings during ﬁscal 2023 resulting from borrowings pursuant to a $15.7 billion delayed draw term 
loan credit agreement (Bridge Credit Agreement), a $5.6 billion term loan credit agreement (Term Loan 
Credit Agreement), the issuance of $12.3 billion of senior notes and, to a lesser extent, issuances of 
commercial paper notes. The amount of indebtedness under the Bridge Credit Agreement was fully 
repaid from the proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and most of the 
proceeds from the issuance of $12.3 billion of senior notes during ﬁscal 2023. The increase in interest 
expense was partially oﬀset by lower interest expense that resulted from $8.3 billion and $3.8 billion of 
scheduled repayments made during ﬁscal 2022 and 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
Non-Operating Expenses, net:   Non-operating expenses, net consists primarily of interest income, 
net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net proﬁts of our majority-
owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan), 
net losses related to equity investments including losses attributable to equity method investments and 
net other income and expenses, including net unrealized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
related to our deferred compensation plan, and non-service net periodic pension income and losses.

Our non-operating expenses, net decreased during ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022 primarily due to 
higher interest income due to higher average interest rates that were applicable to our cash, cash 
equivalent and marketable securities balances; and lower other losses, net, which was primarily 
attributable to higher unrealized investment gain associated with certain marketable equity securities 
that we held for employee beneﬁt plans, and for which an equal and oﬀsetting amount was recorded to 
our operating expenses during the same period. These decreases were partially oﬀset by higher net 
losses associated with equity investments and higher foreign currency losses.
Provision for Income Taxes:   Our eﬀective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were 
the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax 
rates. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual 
Report for a discussion regarding the diﬀerences between the eﬀective income tax rates as presented 
for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in eﬀect during these 
periods. Future eﬀective tax rates could be adversely aﬀected by an unfavorable shift of earnings 
weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by 
adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by 
employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.

Provision for income taxes decreased during ﬁscal 2023, relative to the corresponding prior year period, 
primarily due to decreases attributable to a combination of the net excess beneﬁt of amortization of 
Cerner intangible assets, a favorable mix of earnings when compared to ﬁscal 2022, and, to a lesser 
extent, tax beneﬁts related to stock-based compensation, which together were partially oﬀset by the net 
tax impact of the absence of certain litigation related charges we incurred in ﬁscal 2022.

Working capital:   The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2023 in comparison to May 31, 2022 
was primarily due to $27.8 billion net cash used for our acquisition of Cerner, $1.6 billion of repayment 
of senior notes assumed from our acquisition of Cerner, $3.5 billion of long-term senior notes that were 
reclassiﬁed to current liabilities, cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay 
dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures during ﬁscal 2023. These 
unfavorable impacts were partially oﬀset by cash proceeds from borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan 
Credit Agreement and the issuance of senior notes (refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), the favorable impacts 
to our net current assets resulting from net income and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Our 
working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the 
amounts and timing of which are variable. 
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:   Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of 
deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 
days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain 
other securities. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2023 in 
comparison to May 31, 2022 was primarily due to the net cash outﬂows of $27.8 billion for our 
acquisition of Cerner, $1.6 billion of repayment of senior notes assumed from our acquisition of Cerner, 
$3.8 billion of repayment of senior notes due October 2022 and February 2023, repurchases of our 
common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. 
These cash outﬂows during ﬁscal 2023 were partially oﬀset by certain cash inﬂows, primarily due to 
cash inﬂows generated by borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the issuance of 
senior notes and commercial paper notes, as well as cash inﬂows from our operations and stock option 
exercises during ﬁscal 2023. During ﬁscal 2023, we also borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge 
Credit Agreement which was fully repaid within the same period.

* Not meaningful
Cash ﬂows from operating activities:   Our largest source of operating cash ﬂows is cash collections 
from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments 
from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the 
contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a ﬁscal year, we also have 
historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware oﬀerings and other 
services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related 
expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, 
taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased during ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 2022 primarily 
due to higher net income that was primarily due to the absence of certain litigation related charges 
recorded during ﬁscal 2022 that we generally do not expect to recur and certain cash favorable working 
capital changes, net in ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022.
Cash ﬂows from investing activities:   The changes in cash ﬂows from investing activities primarily 
relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in 
marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, 
to support our growth.
Net cash used for investing activities was $36.5 billion during ﬁscal 2023 compared to net cash provided 
by investing activities of $11.2 billion during ﬁscal 2022. The increase in net cash used for investing 
activities during ﬁscal 2023 was primarily due to the cash used for our acquisition of Cerner, an increase 
in cash used for capital expenditures and a decrease in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of 
marketable securities and other investments, partially oﬀset by a decrease in cash used for the 
purchases of marketable securities and other investments, in each case relative to ﬁscal 2022.

Cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities:  The changes in cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities primarily 
relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend 
payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. 
Net cash provided by ﬁnancing activities was $7.9 billion during ﬁscal 2023 compared to the net cash 
used for ﬁnancing activities of $29.1 billion in ﬁscal 2022. The increase in net cash provided by ﬁnancing 
activities was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan Credit 
Agreement and the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper notes, net of repayments; lower 
stock repurchases; lower maturities of senior notes and higher net cash from our employee stock 
program, in each case during ﬁscal 2023 relative to ﬁscal 2022. During ﬁscal 2023, we also borrowed 
$15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement which was fully repaid within the same period.
Free cash ﬂow:   To supplement our statements of cash ﬂows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-
GAAP measures of cash ﬂows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash ﬂows generated from our 
operations. We believe that free cash ﬂow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our 
performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash ﬂow is not meant to be 
considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an 
alternative to cash ﬂows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash ﬂow 
as follows:
 
    Year Ended Ma y 31,

Net cash provided by operating activities  $17,165   80% $9,539

Free cash ﬂow as a percent of net income   100%      75% 
Recent Financing Activities:
Cash Dividends:  In ﬁscal 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.36 per share that totaled 
$3.7 billion. In June 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of 
our outstanding common stock payable on July 26, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of 
business on July 12, 2023. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and 
payment dates are subject to the ﬁnal determination of our Board of Directors.
Credit Agreements and Related Borrowings:  On June 8, 2022, we borrowed $15.7 billion under the 
Bridge Credit Agreement to partly ﬁnance our acquisition of Cerner. We fully repaid the amount 
borrowed under the Bridge Credit Agreement during ﬁscal 2023.
During ﬁscal 2023, we entered into and subsequently expanded the Term Loan Credit Agreement and 
borrowed a total of $4.7 billion under the ﬁrst facility (Term Loan 1 Facility) and $960 million under the 
second facility (Term Loan 2 Facility and, together with the Term Loan 1 Facility, the Term Loan Facilities). 
We used the net proceeds of these borrowings to reduce the amount of indebtedness outstanding under 
the Bridge Credit Agreement. We will begin making quarterly repayments of amounts borrowed under 
both Term Loan Facilities in September 2024. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term 
Loan 1 Facility will be fully due and payable on August 16, 2027, and any remaining unpaid principal 
balance under the Term Loan 2 Facility will be fully due and payable on August 16, 2025, unless the 
termination date of one or both of the Term Loan Facilities is extended.
Senior Notes:  During ﬁscal 2023, we issued $12.3 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:
•$1.0 billion of 5.80% senior notes due November 2025;
•$750 million of 4.50% senior notes due May 2028;
•$1.25 billion of 6.15% senior notes due November 2029;

•$750 million of 4.65% senior notes due May 2030;
•$2.25 billion of 6.25% senior notes due November 2032;
•$1.5 billion of 4.90% senior notes due February 2033;
•$2.5 billion of 6.90% senior notes due November 2052; and
•$2.25 billion of 5.55% senior notes due February 2053.
We used the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to repay the amount of indebtedness 
outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement, to repay $1.3 billion of senior notes due February 2023 
and to partially repay our outstanding commercial paper notes.
Cerner Senior Notes and Other Borrowings:  We assumed $1.6 billion of senior notes and other 
borrowings through our Cerner acquisition, all of which were repaid during ﬁscal 2023. 
Commercial Paper Program:  During ﬁscal 2023, our commercial paper program was increased to 
$6.0 billion. Our commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory 
notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and 
state securities laws. There were $563 million of outstanding commercial paper notes as of May 31, 
2023 (none outstanding as of May 31, 2022) that mature at various dates through June 2023. We use 
the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.
Additional details regarding these activities above are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Common Stock Repurchase Program:   Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2023, approximately $8.2 billion remained 
available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 17.0 million 
shares for $1.3 billion, 185.8 million shares for $16.2 billion, and 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion in 
ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an 
expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working 
capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment 
obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock 
repurchases may be eﬀected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 
10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at 
any time.
Contractual Obligations:   Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2023 consisted of:
•principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our 
consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments;
•routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the 
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included in our consolidated balance sheet;
•operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and
•other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally 
binding.
In addition, as of May 31, 2023, we had $9.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax beneﬁts, including 
related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is 
uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it 
is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during ﬁscal 2024. We 
are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, 
estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and 
many aspects are out of our control. Notes 2, 7, 13 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our most material 
contractual obligations and contingencies.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated 
from operations, and our $6.0 billion, ﬁve-year revolving credit agreement will be suﬃcient to meet our 
working capital,

capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could 
fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our 
internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, 
additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.
Stock-Based Awards
Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to 
attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of 
existing stockholders. 
We recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the 
number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent 
with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2020 has been an annualized rate 
of 1.8% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-
based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the 
company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This 
maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are 
exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2023, which generally have a ten-year exercise 
period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent 
years, our stock repurchase program has more than oﬀset the dilutive eﬀect of our stock-based 
compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future 
depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to 
pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2023, the 
maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and 
regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 8.0%.
During ﬁscal 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the 
annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants 
to senior oﬃcers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of 
a separate executive oﬃcer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a ﬁscal 2023 
equity budget that could be used throughout the ﬁscal year to grant equity within his or her 
organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.
Stock-based awards activity from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2023 is summarized as follows (shares 
in millions):
 
Stock-based awar ds outstanding at May 31, 2020    277

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Equity Price Risk
Marketable and Non-Marketable Equity Investments
Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities investments totaled $972 million and $1.1 billion 
as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our marketable equity securities investments in publicly 
traded companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. Our non-
marketable equity securities investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity 
method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the 
same issuer or for impairment. Our non-marketable equity securities investments accounted for under 
the equity method, primarily in a related party entity, generally do not ﬂuctuate based on market price 
changes. However, these equity method investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds 
the fair value and is not expected to recover. The timing and amounts of changes in fair value of our 
marketable and non-marketable equity investments depends on factors beyond our control, including 
the perceived and actual performance of the companies in which we invest. Our non-marketable 
convertible debt investments would be subject to equity price risk in the future when the convertible 
option is exercised. For additional disclosure regarding the impact to our quarterly results of operations 
from investment volatility, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Currency Risk 
Foreign Currency Translation Risk 
As described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided 
and are expected to continue to provide a signiﬁcant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses 
that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are aﬀected and will 
continue to be aﬀected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in 
foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash ﬂows that we report 
for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end 
of, each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the 
reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables, total revenues 
and total expenses that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
for, and as of the end of, each reporting period.
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk 
We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from 
various intercompany transactions. Our principal currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, 
Brazilian Real, Euro, Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal. We have established a program that primarily utilizes 
foreign currency forward contracts to oﬀset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. 
Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for major currencies 
in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are 
oﬀset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility 
associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our 
foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for 
trading purposes.
Realized gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our 
foreign currency forward contracts, and also costs incurred to enter into these foreign currency forward 
contracts are included in non-operating expenses or income, net in our consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally 
depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange 
rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our 
foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated 
operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in 
which the amounts and timing are unknown. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency 
forward contracts.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation 
under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management, 
including our Principal Executive and Financial Oﬃcer, of the eﬀectiveness of the design and operation 
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). 
Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial 
Oﬃcer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive and Financial Oﬃcer 
has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were eﬀective as of May 31, 2023 to provide 
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we ﬁle or submit 
under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
speciﬁed in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, 
including our Principal Executive and Financial Oﬃcer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over ﬁnancial 
reporting, as such term is deﬁned in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision 
and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Oﬃcer, we 
conducted an evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of May 
31, 2023 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Our internal 
control over ﬁnancial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external 
reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over 
ﬁnancial reporting was eﬀective as of May 31, 2023. We reviewed the results of management’s 
assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.

The eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of May 31, 2023 has been audited by 
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting ﬁrm, as stated in their report which is 
included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As a result of our acquisition of Cerner on June 8, 2022, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, 
subsequent to the date of acquisition, includes certain additional internal controls relating to Cerner. 
Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting 
identiﬁed in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 
15d-15 that occurred during our last ﬁscal quarter that have materially aﬀected, or are reasonably likely 
to materially aﬀect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. 
Inherent Limitations on Eﬀectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Oﬃcer, believes that our disclosure 
controls and procedures and internal control over ﬁnancial reporting are designed to provide reasonable 
assurance of achieving their objectives and are eﬀective at the reasonable assurance level. However, 
our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control 
over ﬁnancial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the 
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reﬂect the fact that there are 
resource constraints and the beneﬁts of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of 
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance 
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations 
include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur 
because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of 
some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The 
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of 
future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals 
under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the 
inherent limitations in a cost-eﬀective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation (the Company) as of 
May 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, 
stockholders’ equity (deﬁcit) and cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2023, and 
the related notes (collectively referred to as the “ﬁnancial statements”). In our opinion, the ﬁnancial 
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of the Company at May 31, 2023 and 
2022, and the results of its operations and its cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended May 
31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 20, 2023 expressed 
an unqualiﬁed opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
These ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Company’s ﬁnancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting 
ﬁrm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess 
the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing 
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the 
accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our 
opinion. 
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the 
ﬁnancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and 
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the ﬁnancial statements and (2) involved our 
especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not 
alter in any way our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating 
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or 
disclosures to which they relate.
 
   Income Tax – Uncertain tax positions
Description 
of the matter As discussed in Note 13 of the ﬁnancial statements, the Company recognizes uncertain tax 
positions and measures unrecognized tax beneﬁts related to various domestic and foreign 
matters. As of May 31, 2023, the total amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $7.7 
billion, of which $3.9 billion, if recognized would impact the Company’s eﬀective tax rate. 
The Company uses signiﬁcant judgment in the accounting for some of these uncertain tax 
positions including the interpretation and application of tax laws and legal rulings in various 
jurisdictions.
Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than 
not to be sustained and the measurement of the beneﬁt of various tax positions was 
complex, involved signiﬁcant judgment, and was based on interpretations and application 
of tax laws and legal rulings. 
61
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
How we 
addressed 
the matter in 
our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating 
eﬀectiveness of the controls over management’s process for interpretation and application 
of tax laws and legal rulings, as well as development of the assumptions and estimates 
used in the measurement of uncertain tax positions. 
To test management’s assessment of which uncertain tax positions are more likely than not 
to be sustained, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating 
management’s assumptions and analysis, including any communications with taxing 
authorities that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We 
involved our tax subject matter professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain 
tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related 
taxing authorities. In addition, we also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to 
these matters included in Note 13 of the ﬁnancial statements.
 
   Business combinations – Valuation of intangible assets
Description 
of the matter As discussed in Note 2 of the ﬁnancial statements, the Company completed the acquisition 
of Cerner Corporation during ﬁscal year 2023 for a total purchase price of $28.2 billion, 
which was accounted for as a business combination. In connection with this acquisition, 
management recognized customer relationship, order backlog, developed technology and 
trade name intangible assets of $12.0 billion. The valuation of the customer relationship 
and developed technology intangible assets is complex and judgmental due to the use of 
subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management when determining 
their estimated fair value. In particular, the fair value estimates for the acquired assets are 
sensitive to changes in assumptions for revenue growth, and cost of revenues and 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Auditing management’s valuation of customer relationship and developed technology 
intangible assets is complex due to the auditor judgment required to evaluate 
management’s assumptions used in determining the fair value of these assets.
How we 
addressed 
the matter in 
our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating 
eﬀectiveness of controls over the determination of the fair value of customer relationships 
and developed technology intangible assets. This included controls over management’s 
development of the assumptions described above.
To test the estimated fair value of the customer relationships and developed technology 
intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating 
the Company’s selection of valuation methodologies with the assistance of our valuation 
specialists and application of acquisition accounting, and evaluating the signiﬁcant 
assumptions used by the Company to develop the forecasted revenue growth rates and 
projected cost of revenues and operating expenses. We compared the signiﬁcant 
assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, and to the historical results 
of the acquired business and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data 
used by management in the valuation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on 
criteria established in the Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Oracle 
Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, eﬀective internal control over ﬁnancial 
reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, 
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deﬁcit) and 
cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report 
dated June 20, 2023 expressed an unqualiﬁed opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining eﬀective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting 
and for its assessment of the eﬀectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting included in the 
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on our audit. We are a 
public accounting ﬁrm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether eﬀective internal control over ﬁnancial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating eﬀectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Deﬁnition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material eﬀect on the 
ﬁnancial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of eﬀectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
May 31, 2023
 
1.ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Oracle Corporation provides products and services that substantially address all aspects of enterprise 
information technology (IT) environments, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We 
deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of ﬂexible and interoperable 
IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an 
approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-
Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud 
Services) oﬀerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services 
delivered via various cloud delivery models enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets 
their speciﬁc business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and 
hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT 
environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support 
contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspeciﬁed license upgrades and maintenance 
releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that 
purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide 
customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical 
support services. We also oﬀer customers a broad set of services oﬀerings that are designed to improve 
customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.
Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation 
and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.
Basis of Financial Statements
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and 
majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are 
reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s 
stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not 
signiﬁcant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented 
separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net in our 
consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
On June 8, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Cerner Corporation (Cerner), a provider of digital 
information systems used within hospitals and health systems, by means of a merger of one of our 
wholly owned subsidiaries with and into Cerner such that Cerner became an indirect, wholly owned 
subsidiary of Oracle. Through our acquisition of Cerner, we enhanced our oﬀerings of each of our three 
existing businesses, cloud and license, hardware and services. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
included in this Annual Report include the ﬁnancial results of Cerner prospectively from the date of 
acquisition. Refer to Note 2 below for additional details regarding our acquisition of Cerner.
The comparability of our consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 
was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during ﬁscal 2022. The comparability of 
our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended May 31, 2021 was impacted by a $2.3 
billion net income tax beneﬁt related to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted 
in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Refer to Note 13 below for additional 
information regarding our income taxes.

Use of Estimates
Our consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) 
Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation (ASC), and we consider various staﬀ accounting bulletins and other 
applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain 
estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions 
upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these 
estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can 
aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the ﬁnancial statements as well as 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there 
are diﬀerences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements will be aﬀected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction 
is speciﬁcally dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There 
are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not 
produce a materially diﬀerent result.
During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers 
and increased the estimate of the useful lives from four years to ﬁve years eﬀective at the beginning of 
ﬁscal 2023. Based on the carrying value of our servers as of May 31, 2022, this change in accounting 
estimate decreased our total operating expenses by $434 million during ﬁscal 2023.
Revenue Recognition 
Our sources of revenues include:
•cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and 
cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, which typically represent perpetual software licenses 
purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments; 
•hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered 
Systems, servers, and storage products, and industry-speciﬁc hardware; and hardware support 
revenues; and 
•services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related 
services including consulting and advanced customer services.
License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to 
cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support 
contracts provide customers with rights to unspeciﬁed software product upgrades, maintenance releases 
and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical 
content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support 
contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. 
Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.
Cloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services oﬀerings, which deliver 
applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop 
functionality for, provide unspeciﬁed updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade 
and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated 
period. 
Cloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting 
customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-speciﬁc 
software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. The 
vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support 
contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option. 
Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our 
Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-speciﬁc hardware. Our hardware 
support oﬀerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that 
are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product 
repairs, maintenance services and 
70

technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net 
hardware products fees.
Our services are oﬀered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to 
customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our 
customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in 
Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to 
provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products 
and services. 
We apply the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) as a single 
standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud, license, hardware and services 
arrangements and generally require revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised 
goods or services provided to our customers, reﬂecting the amount of consideration we expect to 
receive for those goods or services. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application 
of the following steps:
•identiﬁcation of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•identiﬁcation of the performance obligations in the contract;
•determination of the transaction price;
•allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and 
•recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisﬁed.
Our customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other 
services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our 
channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.
The timing of revenue recognition may diﬀer from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an 
unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, 
when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance 
sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard 
payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise 
licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer 
use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware 
support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and cloud infrastructure 
contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally 
invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a ﬁnancing 
component are contracts ﬁnanced through our Oracle ﬁnancing division. The transaction price for a 
contract that is ﬁnanced through our Oracle ﬁnancing division is adjusted to reﬂect the time value of 
money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net 
within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the 
transaction is being ﬁnanced.
Our revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our 
arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as deﬁned in the respective agreements, 
the ﬁnancial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insigniﬁcant. 
Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or 
services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently 
remitted to governmental authorities.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services
Revenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the 
contractual period that the cloud services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made 
available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes 
the beneﬁts of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services that are 
provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the 
utilization of the services by the customer.

Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support
Oracle’s primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware 
support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspeciﬁed software 
product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when 
they are available, and hardware product repairs, as applicable. Oracle is obligated to make the license 
and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, 
revenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably 
over the contractual periods that the support services are provided.
Revenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Premise Licenses
Revenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally 
recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to 
download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-
premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For 
usage-based royalty arrangements with a ﬁxed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is 
generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.
Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products
The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or ﬁrmware, are highly 
interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The 
revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the 
hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.
Revenue Recognition for Services 
Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for ﬁxed 
price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to 
completion. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are 
performed.
Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations 
Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining 
whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a 
signiﬁcant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally 
not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based 
on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract. 
We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance 
obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the 
observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar 
customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a 
periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have 
not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase 
license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License 
support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access 
the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on 
observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling 
price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other 
observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a 
contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach 
whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are ﬁrst allocated a portion of the 
transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price 
allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.

Remaining Performance Obligations from Customer Contracts
Trade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related 
uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. The 
amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 that were included in the 
opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was approximately $8.3 
billion and $8.8 billion. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisﬁed in prior periods and 
impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2023, 
2022 and 2021.
Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, 
and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and 
have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in 
future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that 
we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each ﬁscal year, the amounts and 
volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth ﬁscal quarter 
and lowest in our ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter. These seasonal impacts inﬂuence how our remaining performance 
obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate ﬂuctuations and other factors, 
inﬂuence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 
31, 2023, our remaining performance obligations were $67.9 billion, approximately 49% of which we 
expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months, 35% over the subsequent month 13 to 
month 36, and the remainder thereafter.
Sales of Financing Receivables
We oﬀer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and 
services oﬀerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that 
we have ﬁnanced for our customers on a non-recourse basis to ﬁnancial institutions within 90 days of 
the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to ﬁnancial 
institutions as sales of ﬁnancing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of 
these ﬁnancing receivables. During ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, $2.0 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, 
respectively, of our ﬁnancing receivables were sold to ﬁnancial institutions.
Business Combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our 
acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of 
assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is deﬁned as an integrated set of assets and 
activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to 
investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual 
assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business 
requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of 
consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent 
consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to reﬁnement. As a 
result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, 
we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding oﬀset to 
goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or ﬁnal determination of 
the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes ﬁrst, any subsequent adjustments 
are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities 
of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs 
pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the 
business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and 
measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability 
is incurred. Abandoned operating leases related to an acquired company or our internal operations are 
accounted for as Right-of-Use (ROU) asset impairment charges pursuant to ASC 842, Leases and are 
accounted for separately from the business combination. In all periods 
73

presented, when estimating the asset impairment charges, assumptions were applied regarding 
estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can diﬀer from actual results. This may require us 
to revise our initial estimates which may aﬀect our results of operations and ﬁnancial position in the 
period the revision is made.
For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the 
acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies 
throughout the measurement period in order to obtain suﬃcient information to assess whether we 
include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair 
value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, 
which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for 
such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been 
incurred at the business acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably 
estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or ﬁnal determination of the net asset values for the 
business combination, whichever comes ﬁrst, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will aﬀect 
earnings and could have a material eﬀect on our results of operations and ﬁnancial position.
In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business 
combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based 
upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to 
our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identiﬁed within the measurement period. 
Subsequent to the measurement period or our ﬁnal determination of the tax allowance’s or 
contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes ﬁrst, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax 
related valuation allowances will aﬀect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of 
operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and ﬁnancial position.
Marketable and Non-Marketable Investments 
In accordance with ASC 320, Investments—Debt Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these 
instruments, we classify substantially all of our marketable debt securities investments as available-for-
sale. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as 
a component of stockholders’ equity, except for any unrealized losses determined to be related to credit 
losses, which we record within non-operating expenses or income, net in the accompanying consolidated 
statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges 
are required. All of our marketable debt securities investments are classiﬁed as current based on the 
nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.
Investments in equity securities, other than any equity method investments, are generally recorded at 
their fair values, if the fair values are readily determinable. Non-marketable equity securities for which 
the fair values are not readily determinable and where we do not have control of, nor signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence in, the investee are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable price 
changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer with any gains 
or losses recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net as of and for each 
reporting period. For equity investments through which we have signiﬁcant inﬂuence in, but not control 
of, the investee, we account for such investments pursuant to the equity method of accounting whereby 
we record our proportionate share of the investee’s earnings or losses, amortization of diﬀerences 
between our investment basis and underlying equity in net assets of the investee, excluding component 
representing goodwill, and impairment, if any, as a component of non-operating expenses or income, 
net for each reporting period. 
Our non-marketable debt investments and equity securities and related instruments totaled $1.6 billion 
and $1.2 billion as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are subject to periodic impairment reviews 
and are classiﬁed as a part of non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The 
majority of the non-marketable investments held as of these dates were with a related party entity for 
which we follow the equity method of accounting. We are also a counterparty to certain options to 
acquire additional equity interests in that entity at various times through June 2025 and we could obtain 
control of that entity should such options be exercised.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that 
we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our 
investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative ﬁnancial instruments. 
The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4. 
Allowances for Credit Losses 
We record allowances for credit losses based upon a speciﬁc review of all signiﬁcant outstanding 
invoices. For those invoices not speciﬁcally reviewed, provisions are provided at diﬀering rates, based 
upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the 
receivable was recorded in and current and expected future economic conditions. We write-oﬀ a 
receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection eﬀorts 
without success.
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash 
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and cash 
equivalents are generally held with large, diverse ﬁnancial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount 
of exposure to any single ﬁnancial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit 
purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities. Our derivative contracts are 
transacted with various ﬁnancial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to 
counterparty credit-related losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security 
agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these 
contracts ﬂuctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do not require collateral to 
secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations 
we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the signiﬁcant majority of our 
customer contracts and by the diversiﬁcation of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 
10% or more of our total revenues in ﬁscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.
We outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of the substantial majority of our hardware 
products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. Further, we have 
simpliﬁed our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and 
the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any 
inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware 
products could adversely impact future operating results of our cloud and license and hardware 
businesses. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, 
which approximates actual cost, on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for 
estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by 
product and projections of future demand within speciﬁc time horizons. Inventories in excess of future 
demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of 
changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At 
the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent 
changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established 
cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated 
balance sheets and totaled $298 million and $314 million at May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Other Receivables 
Other receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our 
products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other 
current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $798 million and $791 million at May 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively.

Deferred Sales Commissions
We defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and 
recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support and hardware support contract. Initial sales 
commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized 
on a straight-line basis over a period of beneﬁt that we estimate to be four years. We determine the 
period of beneﬁt by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer 
contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for 
renewal contracts relating to certain of our cloud-based arrangements are generally deferred and then 
amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period, which is generally one to 
three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and 
marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and asset balances for deferred sales 
commissions are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in our consolidated 
balance sheets. 
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is 
computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range 
from one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful 
lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are 
periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any signiﬁcant property 
impairment charges in ﬁscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net 
tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indeﬁnite 
useful life are itemized in Note 6 below and are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range 
from one to 10 years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased 
intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining 
periods of amortization. 
The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at 
least annually for goodwill and indeﬁnite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is 
assessed for impairment, we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of 
impairment (optional assessment) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the 
optional assessment be used for any given ﬁscal year, qualitative factors considered for a reporting unit 
include: cost factors; ﬁnancial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other 
factors; entity speciﬁc factors; industry and market considerations; macroeconomic conditions; and 
other relevant events and factors aﬀecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative 
assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying 
value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those 
reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit 
with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of each 
reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash ﬂows 
the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the 
discounted cash ﬂow analysis; future economic and market conditions; and market comparables of peer 
companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the diﬀerence, 
limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit. Our most recent goodwill impairment 
analysis was performed on March 1, 2023 and did not result in a goodwill impairment charge. We did not 
recognize impairment charges in ﬁscal 2022 or 2021.
76
Table of Contents

Recoverability of ﬁnite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the 
asset to the future undiscounted cash ﬂows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level 
associated asset grouping. Recoverability of indeﬁnite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison 
of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount 
of any impairment is measured as the diﬀerence between the carrying value and the fair value of the 
impaired asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in ﬁscal 2023, 2022 or 
2021. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our ﬁnite lived intangible assets and may adjust 
the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that a shorter amortization period is more reﬂective of the period in which these assets contribute to our 
cash ﬂows. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
During ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we used derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage foreign currency 
and interest rate risks. We do not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading purposes. We account 
for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires 
that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
measured at its fair value as of each reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes in our 
derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless speciﬁc hedge accounting and documentation 
criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges). 
The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the 
derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, 
loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a 
corresponding earnings oﬀset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative 
instrument designated as a cash ﬂow hedge, during each reporting period, we record the change in fair 
value of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance 
sheets and the change is reclassiﬁed to earnings in the period the hedged item aﬀects earnings.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at 
the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We 
generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease 
commencement date in determining the present value of future payments, because the implicit rate of 
the lease is generally not known. ROU assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at 
lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments 
and less any lease incentives. Our lease terms that are used in determining our operating lease liabilities 
at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain 
that we will exercise such options. We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as 
operating expenses. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such 
cases, we generally account for the components as a single lease component. We do not recognize lease 
assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of less than one year.
ROU assets related to our operating leases are included in other non-current assets, short-term 
operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities 
are included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash ﬂow movements 
related to our lease activities are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable 
and other liabilities as presented in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated 
statements of cash ﬂows for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. Note 10 below provides additional 
information regarding our leases.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of 
each signiﬁcant matter and assess our potential ﬁnancial exposure. Descriptions of our accounting 
policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under 
“Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business 
combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a 
77

liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered 
probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 16 below provides additional information 
regarding certain of our legal contingencies.
Foreign Currency
We transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign 
operation is the local country’s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside 
the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and 
liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the 
balance sheet dates. The eﬀects of foreign currency translation adjustments are substantially included in 
stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and 
related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating expenses or 
income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $249 million, $199 million 
and $112 million in ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation 
We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock 
unit awards, service-based employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs), and 
purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock 
Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be 
recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We account for 
forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur. 
For our service-based stock awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line 
basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years.
For our PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis related to awards 
that are probable of achievement over the longer of the (a) estimated implicit service period for 
performance-metric achievement, or (b) derived service period for market-based metric achievement. 
During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based 
on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of 
performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or 
changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-based 
compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in 
estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reﬂected in 
the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSO tranche on a 
cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered. 
Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively. 
We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain 
of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in each 
reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in 
connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to 
recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are 
realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-
based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax 
asset established, and recorded as a discrete detriment/beneﬁt to our provision for income taxes in such 
period. Note 12 below provides additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans 
and related expenses. 
Research and Development Costs and Software Development Costs
All research and development costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and 
Development. Software development costs required to be capitalized under ASC 985-20, Costs of 
Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed, and under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, were not 
material to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements in ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.

Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred income 
taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary diﬀerences between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax 
purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax 
beneﬁt that is more likely than not to be realized.
A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain 
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ﬁrst step is to determine if the weight of 
available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an 
audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure 
the tax beneﬁt as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate 
settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for 
income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.
A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation 
allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” 
above.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 
848): Facilitation of the Eﬀects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) and also 
issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides 
optional guidance for contract modiﬁcations and certain hedging relationships associated with the 
transition from reference rates that are

expected to be discontinued. We will adopt Topic 848 when our relevant contracts are modiﬁed upon 
transition to alternative reference rates. We do not expect our adoption of Topic 848 to have a material 
impact on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
2.ACQUISITIONS
Acquisition of Cerner Corporation
On December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with 
Cerner, a provider of digital information systems used within hospitals and health systems that are 
designed to enable medical professionals to deliver better healthcare to individual patients and 
communities.
On January 19, 2022, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender oﬀer to purchase all 
of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Cerner at a purchase price of $95.00 per 
share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, based upon the terms and subject to the 
conditions set forth in the Oﬀer to Purchase dated January 19, 2022, and the related Letter of 
Transmittal.
On June 8, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the tender oﬀer and applicable Delaware law, we acquired all 
the outstanding Cerner shares and eﬀectuated the merger of Cerner with and into a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Oracle and Cerner became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. Vested equity 
awards outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger were cancelled in exchange 
for the right to receive an amount in cash based on a formula contained in the Merger Agreement. The 
unvested equity awards to acquire Cerner common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the 
conclusion of the merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Oracle common 
stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. We have included the ﬁnancial results of 
Cerner in our consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date of acquisition. During ﬁscal 2023, Cerner 
contributed $5.9 billion to our total revenues.
The total purchase price for Cerner was $28.2 billion, which consisted of $28.2 billion in cash and $55 
million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. Pursuant to our 
business combinations accounting policy, we estimated the fair values of net tangible and intangible 
assets acquired, and the excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of such fair values 
was recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on 
estimated fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from Cerner:
 
(in millions)     
Cash and marketable securities  $ 769 
Trade receivables, net    854 
Property, plant and equipment, net   1,512 
Intangible assets   11,972 
Goodwill   18,618 
Other assets    520 
Accounts payable and other liabilities   (1,691)
Deferred revenues    (305)
Senior notes and other borrowings   (1,600)
Deferred tax liabilities, net   (2,424)
Total  $28,225 
All of the $1.6 billion of senior notes and other borrowings assumed through our Cerner acquisition were 
repaid during ﬁscal 2023. Refer to Note 7 below for more information. Generally, goodwill recognized as 
a part of our acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.
Other Fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 Acquisitions 
During ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain 
technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services oﬀerings. These 
acquisitions were not signiﬁcant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
The unaudited pro forma ﬁnancial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of 
operations for Oracle and Cerner. The unaudited pro forma ﬁnancial information for all periods presented 
includes the business combination accounting eﬀects resulting from this acquisition, including 
amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation charges for unvested 
restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed and the related tax eﬀects as though Cerner 
was acquired as of the beginning of ﬁscal 2022. The unaudited pro forma ﬁnancial information as 
presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of 
operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of ﬁscal 
2022.
The unaudited pro forma ﬁnancial information for ﬁscal 2023 and 2022 combines the historical results of 
Oracle for ﬁscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, the historical results of Cerner for the twelve months 
ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (adjusted due to diﬀerences in reporting periods and 
considering the date we acquired Cerner), and the eﬀects of the pro forma adjustments listed above. 
The unaudited pro forma ﬁnancial information is as follows:
    Year Ended Ma y 31,  
(in millions, except per share data)   2023    2022  
Total revenues  $ 50,065  $ 48,218 
Net income  $ 8,456  $ 4,988 
Basic earnings per share  $ 3.14  $ 1.85 
Diluted earnings per share  $ 3.06  $ 1.79 
 
3.CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and 
other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, 
marketable equity securities and certain other securities.
The amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated 
their fair values at May 31, 2023 and 2022. We use the speciﬁc identiﬁcation method to determine any 
realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale. Such 
realized gains and losses were insigniﬁcant for ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. The following table 
summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketable securities held, substantially all of 
which were classiﬁed as available-for-sale:
 
    May 31,  
(in millions)   2023    2022  
Money market funds  $ 1,694  $ 12,842 
Time deposits and other    468    520 
Total investments $ 2,162  $ 13,362 
Investments classiﬁed as cash equivalents  $ 1,740  $ 12,843 
Investments classiﬁed as marketable securities  $ 422  $ 519 
 
As of May 31, 2023 and 2022, all of our marketable debt securities investments mature within one year. 
Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, 
we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit 
ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment 
policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk 
and market risk.
Restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated 
balance sheets as of May 31, 2023 and 2022 and our consolidated statements of cash ﬂows for the 
years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was nominal.

4.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 deﬁnes fair value as the 
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements 
for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most 
advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of 
nonperformance. 
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable 
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s 
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is signiﬁcant to 
the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair 
value: 
•Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted 
prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets 
or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be 
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; 
or 
•Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are 
signiﬁcant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 
and Level 2 inputs are deﬁned above):

Our marketable securities investments consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain 
other securities. Marketable securities as presented per our consolidated balance sheets included debt 
securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months and the remainder 
of the debt securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. As of May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2022, 
all of our marketable debt securities investments mature within one year. Our valuation techniques used 
to measure the fair values of our instruments that were classiﬁed as Level 1 in the table above were 
derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist. Our valuation 
techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above were derived 
from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market 
data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash ﬂow 
techniques, with all signiﬁcant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including 
reference rate yield curves, among others.

In ﬁscal 2018 we enter ed into certain cross-cur rency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic eﬀect of converting our 
ﬁxed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate,  
U.S. Dollar -denominated debt of $871 million based on LIBOR. The eﬀective interest rates as of May 31, 2023 and 2022 after 
consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were 8.36% and 4.10%, respectively, for the July 2025 Notes. Refer 
to Note 1 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges.
In ﬁscal 2023, we issued $12.3 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay the 
amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement, to repay $1.3 billion  of senior notes due February 2023  and 
to partially repay our outstanding commer cial paper notes. The interest is payable semi-annually . We may redeem some or all of the 
senior notes of each series prior to their maturit y, subject to certain restrictions, and the payme nt of an applicable make-whole  
premium in certain instances.

borrowings to ﬁxed-rate borrowings with a ﬁxed annual interest rate of 3.07%, plus a margin depending on the credit rating assigned  
to our long-ter m senior unsecur ed debt, as further discussed below .
Future principal payments (adjusted for the eﬀects of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements 
associated with the July 2025 Notes) for all of our borrowings at May 31, 2023 were as follows (in 
millions): 
 
Fiscal 2024  $ 4,063 
Fiscal 2025    10,000 
Fiscal 2026    5,694 
Fiscal 2027    5,250 
Fiscal 2028    10,170 
Thereafter    55,750 
Total  $ 90,927 
Senior Notes
Interest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes listed in the above table except for the Euro Notes 
for which interest is payable annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series 
prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole 
premium in certain instances.
The senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our 
commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial paper program below) 
and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation, including the Revolving 
Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement as described further below. All existing and 
future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be eﬀectively senior to the senior 
notes, borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, any future borrowings pursuant to the 
Revolving Credit Agreement and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in 
compliance with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2023.
Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement
On June 8, 2022, we borrowed $15.7 billion under a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (Bridge 
Credit Agreement) that we entered into in March 2022 to partly ﬁnance our acquisition of Cerner. The 
Bridge Credit Agreement provided that, subject to certain exceptions, net cash proceeds received by us 
from certain debt and equity issuances shall result in mandatory prepayments under the Bridge Credit 
Agreement. Interest was based on either (a) a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-based 
formula plus a margin of 100.0 basis points to 137.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating 
assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of 0.0 basis 
points to 37.5 basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Bridge 
Credit Agreement. The eﬀective interest rate for ﬁscal 2023 was 3.57%. We fully repaid the amount 
borrowed under the Bridge Credit Agreement during ﬁscal 2023.
Revolving Credit Agreement
Our Revolving Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured $6.0 billion, ﬁve-year revolving credit facility 
(the Revolving Facility) to be used for our working capital purposes and for other general corporate 
purposes. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may borrow, 
prepay and reborrow amounts under the Revolving Facility during the term of the Revolving Credit 
Agreement. All amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement will become due on March 8, 
2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at our request or, if an event of default 
occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related

events). Interest is based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of 87.5 basis points to 
150.0 basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or 
(b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of 0.0 basis points to 50.0 basis points, depending on the same 
such credit rating, each as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of May 31, 2023 and 2022, 
we did not have any outstanding borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
Five-Year Term Loan Credit Agreement
On August 16, 2022, we entered into a $4.4 billion term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit 
Agreement), which provides for a total term loan commitment of $4.4 billion, comprised of a $3.6 billion 
term loan (Term Loan 1 Facility) and a $790 million term loan (Term Loan 2 Facility and, together with the 
Term Loan 1 Facility, the Term Loan Facilities). The proceeds of the Term Loan Facilities may only be used 
to reﬁnance indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Credit Agreement and to pay related fees and 
expenses.
On November 2, 2022, the total term loan commitment was increased by $1.3 billion, comprised of $1.1 
billion under the Term Loan 1 Facility and $170 million under the Term Loan 2 Facility pursuant to the 
terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
We may request additional commitments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement up to a maximum of 
$6.0 billion (each, an Incremental Borrowing). The use of proceeds of any Incremental Borrowing will be 
speciﬁed at the time of such borrowing and may include working capital purposes and other general 
corporate purposes.
We initially borrowed $4.4 billion on August 16, 2022, and we borrowed an incremental $1.3 billion on 
November 2, 2022, each under the Term Loan Facilities. We used the net proceeds of the borrowings 
under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to reduce the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the 
Bridge Credit Agreement. The eﬀective interest rate for these borrowings during ﬁscal 2023 was 5.76%.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for repayment of borrowings under the Term Loan Facilities as 
follows:
•an amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by 1.25% on 
September 30, 2024 and quarterly thereafter until June 30, 2026;
•an amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by 2.50% on 
September 30, 2026 and quarterly thereafter until June 30, 2027; and
•any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 1 Facility will become fully due and 
payable on August 16, 2027 and any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 2 
Facility will become fully due and payable on August 16, 2025 (subject to any extension of the 
Term Loan 2 Facility termination date, as set out below), unless the outstanding loans are prepaid 
earlier at the request of Oracle or accelerated by the lenders if an event of default occurs.
The termination date of the Term Loan 2 Facility may be extended at our sole option by up to 2 years. 
The termination date of each Term Loan Facility may also be further extended at each lender’s option by 
up to 2 years.
Interest is based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of 147.5 basis points to 197.5 
basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a 
Base Rate formula plus a margin of 47.5 basis points to 97.5 basis points, depending on the same such 
credit rating, each as set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants 
and events of default, including the requirement that the ratio of “Consolidated EBITDA” to 
“Consolidated Net Interest Expense” (each term as deﬁned in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) of Oracle 
and its subsidiaries shall not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any ﬁscal quarter during the period 
that the Term Loan Credit Agreement is eﬀective. If an event of default occurs under the Term Loan 
Credit Agreement and is not cured within the applicable grace period or waived, any unpaid amounts 
under the Term Loan Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable. We were in 
compliance with such covenants as of May 31, 2023.

Cash Flow Hedge—Interest Rate Swap Agreements
In August 2022, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to manage the related interest 
rate risk of $4.4 billion borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement by eﬀectively converting the 
ﬂoating-rate to ﬁxed-rate. The economic eﬀect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty 
of the cash ﬂows associated with ﬂoating-rate interest payments of the Term Loan Credit Agreement by 
a ﬁxed annual interest rate of 3.07%, plus a margin depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-
term senior unsecured debt as mentioned above. We have designated these interest rate swap 
agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash ﬂow hedges 
pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
The fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized either as non-current assets or 
non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair values of these interest 
rate swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated 
balance sheets and an amount is reclassiﬁed out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into non-
operating income or expense, net in the same period that corresponding interest expense is recognized.
We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes.
Cerner Senior Notes and Other Borrowings
In connection with our acquisition of Cerner, we assumed:
•$1.0 billion par value of legacy Cerner senior notes. The acquisition triggered a mandatory oﬀer 
to prepay such senior notes in accordance with the terms of the underlying note purchase 
agreements. Holders of $931 million par value of senior notes exercised the option for 
prepayment, and accordingly, such notes together with accrued interest were redeemed on June 
8, 2022, and the remaining outstanding senior notes together with accrued interest were 
redeemed during the second quarter of ﬁscal 2023; and
•$600 million of principal amount of revolving credit loans. The entire loan along with accrued 
interest was settled and the credit facility was terminated on June 8, 2022.
Commercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes
During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2023, our commercial paper program was increased to $6.0 billion. Our 
commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant 
to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities 
laws pursuant to dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement 
with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas.
There were $563 million of outstanding commercial paper notes as of May 31, 2023 (none outstanding 
as of May 31, 2022) that mature at various dates through June 2023. The eﬀective interest rate including 
issuance costs was 4.89% for ﬁscal 2023. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial 
paper for general corporate purposes.
8.RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Fiscal 2022 Oracle Restructuring Plan
During ﬁscal 2022, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and 
further improve eﬃciencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational 
activities (2022 Restructuring Plan). In ﬁscal 2023, our management supplemented the 2022 
Restructuring Plan to reﬂect additional actions that we expected to take. Restructuring costs associated 
with the 2022 Restructuring Plan were recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our 
consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred. We recorded $493 million and $223 million 
of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2022 Restructuring Plan in 
88

ﬁscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total costs recorded to date in our consolidated statements of 
operations in connection with the 2022 Restructuring Plan were $716 million. Actions pursuant to the 
2022 Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of May 31, 2023.
Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan
During ﬁscal 2019, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and 
further improve eﬃciencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational 
activities (2019 Restructuring Plan). In ﬁscal 2021, our management supplemented the 2019 
Restructuring Plan to reﬂect additional actions that we expected to take. Restructuring costs associated 
with the 2019 Restructuring Plan were recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our 
consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred. We recorded $430 million of restructuring 
expenses in connection with the 2019 Restructuring Plan in ﬁscal 2021. The total costs recorded in our 
consolidated statements of operations in connection with the 2019 Restructuring Plan were $1.2 billion. 
Actions pursuant to the 2019 Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of May 31, 2021.

9.DEFERRED REVENUES
Deferred revenues consisted of the following:
 
    May 31,  
(in millions)   2023    2022  
Cloud services and license support  $ 7,983  $ 7,406 
Hardware    535    555

Deferred revenues, non-current (in other non-current liabilities)   968    753 
Total deferred revenues  $ 9,938  $ 9,110 
 
Deferred cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially 
represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or support contracts that are typically billed in 
advance with corresponding revenues generally being recognized ratably or based upon customer usage 
over the respective contractual periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our 
services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are 
performed. Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer 
payments that related to undelivered products and services or speciﬁed enhancements.
10.LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES 
Leases
We have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As 
of May 31, 2023, our operating leases substantially have remaining terms of one year to ﬁfteen years, 
some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases. 
Operating lease expenses totaled $873 million, net of sublease income of $11 million in ﬁscal 2023 and 
$766 million, net of sublease income of $12 million in ﬁscal 2022. At May 31, 2023, ROU assets, current 
lease liabilities and non-current lease liabilities for our operating leases were $4.6 billion, $865 million 
and $4.0 billion, respectively. We

recorded ROU assets of $2.0 billion in exchange for operating lease obligations during the year ended 
May 31, 2023. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was 
$894 million and $808 million for the year ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of May 31, 
2023, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately eight years 
and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligations was 4.0%. As of 
May 31, 2023, we have $9.1 billion of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data 
centers, that are expected to commence in ﬁscal 2024 generally for terms of three to ﬁfteen years that 
were not reﬂected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2023 or in the maturities table 
below.
Maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows as of May 31, 2023 (in millions):
 
Fiscal 2024  $ 906 
Fiscal 2025    832 
Fiscal 2026    783

Total operating lease liability  $ 4,849 
 
Unconditional Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our 
suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: 
ﬁxed or minimum quantities to be purchased; ﬁxed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the 
approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-
assemblies, perform ﬁnal assemblies and perform testing of our hardware products. We also obtain 
individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on 
projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component 
and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulﬁllment within agreed upon lead-times 
and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in 
the amounts disclosed below. Certain routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not 
related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the 
ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in 
order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are diﬃcult to quantify in a meaningful way.
As of May 31, 2023, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in 
millions):
 
Fiscal 2024  $ 1,732 
Fiscal 2025    294 
Fiscal 2026    174 
Fiscal 2027    134 
Fiscal 2028    77 
Thereafter    360 
Total  $ 2,771 
 
As described in Note 7 above, as of May 31, 2023 we have senior notes and other borrowings that 
mature at various future dates and derivative ﬁnancial instruments outstanding that we leverage to 
manage certain risks and exposures.
Guarantees 
Our cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying 
customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, 
we have not incurred 
91
Table of Contents
Index to F inancial Statements
 
any material costs as a result of such indemniﬁcations and have not accrued any material liabilities 
related to such obligations in our consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also 
include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach conﬁdentiality or 
service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these 
indemniﬁcation agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemniﬁcation claims and 
the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Our Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be 
performed in all material respects as deﬁned in the agreement during the service period. Our license 
and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate 
as described in the applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also 
warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a 
period of 90 days from performance of the services.
We occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into ﬁnancial guarantees with third parties in 
the ordinary course of our business including, among others, guarantees related to taxes, import 
licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements 
have not had a material eﬀect on our results of operations, ﬁnancial position or cash ﬂows. 
11.STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)
Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of 
May 31, 2023, approximately $8.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock 
repurchase program. We repurchased 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion, 185.8 million shares for $16.2 
billion, and 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion in ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, under the 
stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase 
activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions 
and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and 
economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be eﬀected from time to time through 
open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may 
be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
During ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $1.36, $1.28 and 
$1.04 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.
In June 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of our 
outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 26, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the 
close of business on July 12, 2023. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future 
record and payment dates are subject to the ﬁnal determination of our Board of Directors.

12.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
Stock Plans
In ﬁscal 2021, we adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan to replace the Amended and Restated 2000 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) which provides for the issuance of long-term 
performance awards, including restricted stock-based awards, non-qualiﬁed stock options and incentive 
stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligible employees, 
oﬃcers and directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. In 
ﬁscal 2022, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved 
the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan and, together with 
the 2000 Plan, the Plans), which increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued 
under the 2020 Plan by 300 million shares.
The total number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan is (i) 390,000,000 shares, plus (ii) 
132,921,827 shares, which were the number of shares that were unissued and available for grant under 
the 2000 Plan as of the date that the 2020 Plan was originally adopted, plus (iii) the number of shares 
granted and outstanding as of the date that the 2020 Plan was originally adopted which would have 
been available again for issuance under the terms of the 2000 Plan had the 2020 Plan not been adopted. 
Under the 2020 Plan, for each share granted as a full value award in the form of a restricted stock unit 
(RSU) or a performance-based restricted stock award (PSU), an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted 
from our pool of shares available for grant.
As of May 31, 2023, 146 million unvested RSUs, 36 million performance-based stock options (PSOs), of 
which 6 million shares were vested, and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase 28 million shares 
of common stock, substantially all of which were vested, were outstanding under the Plans. 
Approximately 208 million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan 
as of May 31, 2023. To date, we have not issued any stock options under the 2020 Plan or any stock 
purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.
The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation 
Committee of the Board. RSUs generally require service-based vesting of 25% annually over four years. 
SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisable 
generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.
PSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Technology Oﬃcer in ﬁscal 
2018 consisted of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially could vest. One 
tranche, which was based solely on the attainment of a market-based metric, was achieved and vested 
in ﬁscal 2022. Each of the remaining six tranches requires the attainment of both a performance metric 
and a market capitalization metric by May 31, 2022, which was subsequently extended by three 
additional ﬁscal years to May 31, 2025 via an amendment approved by the Compensation Committee of 
the Board during ﬁscal 2022. If any of the remaining operational and market capitalization performance 
goals are achieved before May 31, 2025 additional tranches may vest, assuming continued employment 
and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board certiﬁes that performance has 
been achieved. Upon amendment of the PSOs in ﬁscal 2022, we estimated the revised fair values of the 
six unvested tranches of the PSOs using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. We are recognizing 
incremental stock-based compensation expense related to these amended awards for any of the 
remaining unvested tranches that are probable of achievement over the longer of the (a) estimated 
implicit service period for performance-metric achievement, or (b) derived service period for market-
based metric achievement. Stock-based compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting 
is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively 
recognized in the period when such a determination is made. We have estimated remaining service 
periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement as of May 31, 2023 to be 
approximately one to two years.
In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based 
awards and stock options under each acquired company’s respective stock plans, or we substituted 
substantially similar awards under the Plans. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options 
assumed or substituted generally retained

all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. 
As of May 31, 2023, 3 million unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 459,000 
shares of common stock, substantially all of which were vested, were outstanding under acquired 
company stock plans that Oracle assumed.
In ﬁscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for 
the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualiﬁed stock options, to non-
employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the 
terms of the Directors’ Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a 
ﬁscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 
2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest 
over four years, and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. Currently, we only grant RSUs 
that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’ Plan was most recently 
amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the 
amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon ﬁrst 
becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for chairing certain 
Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In 
April 2020, the Compensation Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic RSU 
grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equity grants for 
chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2023, approximately 40,000 unvested RSUs and stock options 
to purchase approximately 339,000 shares of common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding 
under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2023, approximately 1 million shares were available for future 
stock awards under this plan.
The following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity granted pursuant to Oracle-based 
stock plans for our last three ﬁscal years ended May 31, 2023:

total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock-based 
awards was $7.2 billion and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting 
period of 2.76 years.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Restricted Stock-Based Awards
We estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-
based vesting requirements based upon their market values as of the grant dates, discounted for the 
present values of expected dividends.

Tax Beneﬁts from Exercises of Stock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based Awards
Total cash received as a result of stock option exercises was approximately $1.0 billion, $319 million and 
$1.7 billion for ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted 
stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $5.1 billion 
for ﬁscal 2023 and $3.7 billion for each of ﬁscal 2022 and 2021. In connection with the vesting and 
issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that were exercised, the tax beneﬁts 
realized by us were $1.2 billion, $843 million and $842 million for ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of 
common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of 
the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2023, 37 million shares were reserved for future issuances 
under the Purchase Plan. We issued approximately 2 million shares in each of ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 
2021 under the Purchase Plan.
Deﬁned Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans 
We oﬀer various deﬁned contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total deﬁned 
contribution plan expense was $470 million, $412 million and $380 million for ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. 
In the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment 
Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation 
on a per-pay-period basis as deﬁned by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit 
as deﬁned by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, 
currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching 
amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $198 million, $164 million 
and $150 million in ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
We also oﬀer non-qualiﬁed deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a 
portion of their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date speciﬁed by the 
employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each 
approximately $792 million and approximately $756 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, 
and were presented in other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets.

We sponsor certain deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans that are oﬀered primarily by certain of our foreign 
subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local 
regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party 
trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as 
applicable. Our total deﬁned beneﬁt plan pension expenses were $78 million, $67 million and $105 
million for ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The aggregate projected beneﬁt obligation and 
aggregate net liability (funded status, which is substantially included in other non-current liabilities in 
our consolidated balance sheets) of our deﬁned beneﬁt plans as of May 31, 2023 were $939 million and 
$322 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2022 were $1.1 billion and $580 million, respectively.
13.INCOME TAXES 
Our eﬀective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income and losses 
earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Our (provision for) 
beneﬁt from income taxes varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for 
ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research 
and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax eﬀects of stock-based 
compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax eﬀect of Global Intangible 
Low-Taxed Income. In addition, for ﬁscal 2021, our beneﬁt from income taxes varied from the tax 
computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to a total net deferred tax beneﬁt 
of $2.3 billion as a result of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-
group transfer of certain intellectual property rights.
The following is a geographical breakdown of income before income taxes:
 
    Year Ended Ma y 31,  
(in millions)   2023    2022    2021

We provide for United States income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis 
temporary diﬀerences of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indeﬁnitely reinvested outside 
the United States. At May 31, 2023, the amount of temporary diﬀerences related to undistributed 
earnings and other outside basis temporary diﬀerences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon 
which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $11.0 billion. If the undistributed 
earnings and other outside basis diﬀerences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would 
generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated

with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2023, assuming a full 
utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other 
outside basis temporary diﬀerences would be approximately $2.0 billion.
Our net deferred tax assets were $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the 
foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of 
suﬃcient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain beneﬁt from the 
reversal of temporary diﬀerences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The 
amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if 
estimates of future taxable income change. 
The valuation allowance was $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A 
majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2023 and 2022 related to tax assets established in 
purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation 
allowance and the recognition of the associated tax beneﬁts associated with our acquisitions will be 
recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our ﬁnal determination of the valuation 
allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as deﬁned above), whichever comes ﬁrst.
At May 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $380 million, which 
are subject to limitation on their utilization. Approximately $304 million of these federal net operating 
losses expire in various years between ﬁscal 2024 and ﬁscal 2038. Approximately $76 million of these 
federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating 
loss carryforwards of approximately $2.2 billion at May 31, 2023, which expire between ﬁscal 2024 and 
ﬁscal 2043 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of approximately $1.9 billion at May 31, 2023, which are subject to limitations on their 
utilization. Approximately $1.8 billion of these foreign net operating losses are not currently subject to 
expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $61 million, expire 
between ﬁscal 2024 and ﬁscal 2039. At May 31, 2023, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of 
approximately $141 million, which expire in ﬁscal 2026. We had state capital loss carryforwards of 
approximately $314 million, which expire between ﬁscal 2026 and ﬁscal 2036. We had tax credit 
carryforwards of approximately $1.4 billion at May 31, 2023, which are subject to limitations on their 
utilization. Approximately $933 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to 
expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $438 million, expire in 
various years between ﬁscal 2024 and ﬁscal 2043.
We classify our unrecognized tax beneﬁts as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross 
unrecognized tax beneﬁts, including acquisitions, were as follows:
 
    Year Ended Ma y 31,  
(in millions)   2023    2022    2021  
Gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts as of June 1  $7,284  $6,912  $6,972

As of May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, $3.9 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, of 
unrecognized tax beneﬁts would aﬀect our eﬀective tax rate if recognized. We recognized interest and 
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our (provision for) beneﬁt from income taxes line of our 
consolidated statements of operations of $111 million, $93 million and $166 million during ﬁscal 2023, 
2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.7 
billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.
Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of 
Oracle and various acquired entities for years through ﬁscal 2021. Many issues are at an advanced stage 
in the examination process, the most signiﬁcant of which include issues related to transfer pricing, 
domestic production activity, one-time transition tax, foreign tax credits, research and development 
credits and state economic nexus. With respect to all of these domestic audit issues considered in the 
aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2023, our gross unrecognized 
tax beneﬁts could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 
months by as much as $538 million ($442 million net of oﬀsetting tax beneﬁts). Our U.S. federal income 
tax returns have been examined for all years prior to ﬁscal 2013 and, with some exceptions, we are no 
longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have 
been examined for all years prior to ﬁscal 2007, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.
Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining or have examined 
returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through ﬁscal 2023. Many of the relevant tax 
years are at an advanced stage in examination or subsequent controversy resolution processes, the 
most signiﬁcant of which include issues related to transfer pricing and withholding tax. The manner in 
which those issues are resolved and the timing thereof could potentially result in a range of decreases or 
increases in our unrecognized tax beneﬁts over the next 12 months. We believe it was reasonably 
possible that, as of May 31, 2023, the gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts could decrease (whether by 
payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $767 million ($262 
million net of oﬀsetting tax beneﬁts). We also believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 
2023, the gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts could increase in the next 12 months by as much as $637 
million ($111 million net of oﬀsetting US tax beneﬁts). With some exceptions, we are generally no longer 
subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to ﬁscal 2001.
We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to 
income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of 
countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, 
Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain, where the amounts under 
controversy are signiﬁcant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments 
to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or 
any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or ﬁnal outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we 
believe that the ﬁnal outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a 
material eﬀect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is 
unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of beneﬁts in the period we 
determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign 
income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a 
further charge to expense.
We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. 
However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related ﬁnancial statement 
eﬀect thereof.
14.SEGMENT INFORMATION 
ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. 
Operating segments are deﬁned as components of an enterprise about which separate ﬁnancial 
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-
making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating 
decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Technology Oﬃcer. We are organized 
by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of diﬀerent ways, 
the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and 
ﬁnancial results are assessed. The tabular information below presents ﬁnancial

information that is provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the 
company’s performance and allocating company resources. 
We have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a 
single operating segment. All three of our businesses market and sell our oﬀerings globally to 
businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide 
sales force positioned to oﬀer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our enterprise 
applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including 
our cloud services and license support oﬀerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license oﬀerings. 
Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from oﬀerings that are typically contracted 
with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over time with our 
revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion 
of the contractual terms. Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to 
the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for 
which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual 
term. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers 
licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications 
software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the 
point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use, which typically is 
immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each ﬁscal year, our cloud and license business’ 
contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth ﬁscal quarter and the related cash ﬂows are 
typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter of the next ﬁscal year) as we 
receive payments from these contracts. 
Our hardware business provides infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems, 
servers, storage, industry-speciﬁc hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other 
hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also oﬀers 
hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that 
are essential to the functionality of their hardware products and can also include product repairs, 
maintenance services and technical support services that are typically delivered and recognized ratably 
over the contractual term. 
Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of 
their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by 
operating segment.

Disaggregation of Revenues
We have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating ﬁnancial 
performance, and disclosures presented outside of our ﬁnancial statements in our earnings releases and 
used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and 
uncertainty of revenues and cash ﬂows are aﬀected by economic factors. The principal category we use 
to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as presented in our consolidated 
statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as 
per the preceding tables of this footnote.
The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region:

15.EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average 
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by 
dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period, plus the dilutive eﬀect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, 
and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicable pursuant to the treasury 
stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
 
    Year Ended Ma y 31,  
(in millions, except per share data)  2023   2022    2021  
Net income  $8,503  $6,717  $13,746 
Weighted average common shares outstanding   2,696   2,700   2,945 
Dilutive eﬀect of employee stock plans    70    86    77 
Dilutive weighted average common shares outstanding   2,766   2,786   3,022 
Basic earnings per share  $3.15  $2.49  $ 4.67 
Diluted earnings per share  $3.07  $2.41  $ 4.55 
Shares subject to anti-dilutive restricted stock-based awards and 
stock options excluded from calculation    50    34    36 
 
These weighted shares relate to anti-dilutive restricted service based stock-based awar ds as calculated using the treasury stock  
method and contingently issuable shares pursuant to PSOs arrangements. Such shares could be dilutive in the futur e. See Note 12 for 
information r egarding the e xercise prices of our outstanding, une xercised stock options.
 
16.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s NetSuite Acquisition
On May 3 and July 18, 2017, two alleged stockholders ﬁled separate derivative lawsuits in the Court of 
Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf. Thereafter, the court consolidated the 
two derivative cases and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The 
consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our 
Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. 
104(1) (1) (1)

Plaintiﬀ alleged that the defendants breached their ﬁduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to 
purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. The complaint sought (and the operative 
complaint continues to seek) declaratory relief, unspeciﬁed monetary damages (including interest), and 
attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants ﬁled a motion to dismiss, which the court denied on March 19, 
2018.
On May 4, 2018, our Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (SLC) to investigate 
the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 
2019, the SLC ﬁled a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiﬀ should be allowed 
to proceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had 
fulﬁlled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew the SLC’s authority, except that the SLC 
maintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation.
After plaintiﬀ ﬁled the July 18, 2017 complaint, an additional plaintiﬀ joined the case. Plaintiﬀs ﬁled 
several amended complaints, and ﬁled their most recent amended complaint on December 11, 2020. 
The operative complaint asserts claims for breach of ﬁduciary duty against our Chief Executive Oﬃcer, 
our Chief Technology Oﬃcer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former Chief Executive Oﬃcer who passed 
away on October 18, 2019), and two other members of our Board of Directors. Oracle is named as a 
nominal defendant. On December 11, 2020, the estate of Mark Hurd and the two other members of our 
Board of Directors moved to dismiss this complaint. On June 21, 2021, the court granted this motion as 
to the estate of Mark Hurd and one Board member and denied the motion as to the other Board 
member, who ﬁled an answer to the complaint on August 9, 2021. On December 28, 2020, our Chief 
Executive Oﬃcer, our Chief Technology Oﬃcer, and Oracle as a nominal defendant ﬁled answers to the 
operative complaint.
Trial commenced on July 18, 2022, and has concluded. On November 18, 2022, the court held a ﬁnal 
hearing on the parties’ post-trial brieﬁng. On December 27, 2022, the court “so ordered” a stipulation, 
dismissing the Board member from this action. On May 12, 2023, the court issued its trial ruling, ﬁnding 
for defendants and rejecting plaintiﬀs’ claims. On May 22, 2023, plaintiﬀs ﬁled a motion for attorneys’ 
fees, claiming that this lawsuit had conferred a beneﬁt on Oracle. On May 31, 2023, defendants ﬁled a 
bill of costs, as the prevailing party.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material 
impact on our ﬁnancial position or results of operations.
Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Cloud Business
On February 12 and May 6, 2019, two stockholder derivative lawsuits were ﬁled in the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of California. The cases were consolidated, and on July 8, 2019, a 
single plaintiﬀ ﬁled a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint brought various claims 
relating to a Rule 10b-5 class action that was ﬁled in the same court on August 10, 2018, and which was 
settled for a payment by the Company of $17,500,000. That matter is now concluded. In the Rule 10b-5 
class action, plaintiﬀ alleged Oracle and certain Oracle oﬃcers made or were responsible for false and 
misleading statements regarding Oracle’s cloud business.
Plaintiﬀ in the derivative action ﬁled an amended complaint on June 4, 2021. The derivative suit is 
brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief 
Technology Oﬃcer, our Chief Executive Oﬃcer, and the estate of Mark Hurd. Plaintiﬀ claims that the 
alleged actions described in the 10b-5 class action caused harm to Oracle, including harming Oracle 
because Oracle allegedly repurchased its own stock at an inﬂated price. Plaintiﬀ also claims that 
defendants violated their ﬁduciary duties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by failing to 
prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiﬀ also brings derivative claims for violations of federal securities laws. 
Plaintiﬀ seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a ﬁnding that defendants are 
liable for breaching their ﬁduciary duties, an award of damages to Oracle, an order directing defendants 
to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspeciﬁed relief. On June 14, 2021, the court 
“so ordered” a stipulation from the parties, staying this case pending resolution of the 10b-5 action, and 
the court “so ordered” two additional stipulations, staying the case until January 31, 2023. Defendants 
are scheduled to ﬁle their motion to dismiss by June 29, 2023.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe these matters will have a material 
impact on our ﬁnancial position or results of operations.

Other Litigation
We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in 
the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have 
completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these 
matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, 
individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already 
recognized, if any.
