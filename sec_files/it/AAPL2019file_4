Markets and Distribution
The Company’ s customers are primarily in the consumer , small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government
markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small
and mid-size d businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct
sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers,
wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2019 , the Compa ny’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels
accounted for 31% and 69%, respectively , of total net sales.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2019 , 2018  and 2017 .
Competition
The markets for the Company’ s products and services are highly competitive and the Com pany is confronted by aggressive
competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological
advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other
electronic devices. Many of the Company’ s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating
systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. Princ ipal competitive factors important to
the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and
service quality and reliability , design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution
capability , service and support, and corporate reputation.
The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other
electronic devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The
Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate features of the Company’ s products
and applications within their products, or collab orate to offer solutions that are more competit ive than those they currently offer.
These mark ets are characterized by aggressive  price competition, frequent product introduction s, evolving design approaches and
technologies, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and
businesses.
The Company’ s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience
and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide
content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution, including hardware, software and services.
Some of the Company’ s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and
services at little or no profit, or even at a loss, to compete with the Company’ s offerings.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 2
Supply of Components
Although most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components
are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in
the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the
Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant
commodity pricing fluctuations.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the
Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,
initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufactur ing capacities have increased. The
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the
Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Substantially all of the Company’ s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia,
with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.
Research and Development
Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’ s ability to
compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and
technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services,
and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition
of third-party businesses and technology .
Intellectual Property
The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices,
accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of
intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Compan y believes the ownership of such
intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the
Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.
The Company regularly files patent applications  to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is
currently pursuing thousands of patent applicatio ns around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of
issued paten ts, including  utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of
its products and service s. No single intellectua l property right is solely responsible for protec ting the Company’ s products. The
Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.
In addition to Company-owned intellectual property , many of the Company’ s products and services are designed to include
intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of
the Company’ s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on
commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable
terms or at all.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has histor ically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part
to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly  impact net sales, cost of sales and
operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels
as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines
as the launch of a newe r product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product
introduction.
Employees
As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had approximately 137,000 full-time equivalent employees.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding
other statem ents in this Form 10-K. The follow ing information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’ s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
The busines s, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently
known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below , any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly , cause
the Company’ s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial
condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’ s
business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.
Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’ s financial condition and operating results, past
financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performa nce, and investors should not use
historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business, results of operations,
financial condition and growth .
The Company has intern ational operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’ s total net sales. In
addition, a majority of the Company’ s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a
result, the Company’ s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.
Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and
monetary policy , tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuatio ns could materially adversely affect
demand for the Compan y’s products and servic es. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in
response to financial market volatility , negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in
income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.
In addition to an advers e impact on demand for the Company’ s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional
economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’ s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,
distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit
to finance operations and purchases of the Company’ s products; and insolvency .
A downturn  in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectib ility risk on the Company’ s trade
receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’ s ability to issue new
debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’ s financial instruments. These and other economic factors
could materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.
Global markets for the Company’ s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change,
and the Company may be unable to compete ef fectively in these markets.
The Compa ny’s produc ts and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price
competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product
life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance  characteristics, rapid adoption of
technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.
The Company’ s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of
innovative new products , services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believe s it is unique in that it designs and
develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and
related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these
investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services
successfully .
The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register ,
numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’ s competitors seek to compete primarily through
aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company’ s products and infringing on its intellectual property . If
the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on
the Company’ s intellectual property , the Company’ s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely af fected.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 5
The Compan y has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces
substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources,
as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’ s competitors
have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices . Competition has been particularly
intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources,
experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.
Additionally , the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications
within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also
expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’ s approach to providing components seamlessly within their
offerings or work collaboratively to of fer integrated solutions.
Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In
addition, an increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller , simpler and cheaper
than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’ s existing products.
The Company’ s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience
and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide
content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
The Company’ s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’ s ability to continually improve its
products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to
continue to provide products and services that compete ef fectively .
To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions
and transitions of products and services.
Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature  of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually
introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand
for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and
services. The success of new product and servic e introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely
and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’ s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production
ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and
inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to
meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly ,
the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate ef fect of new product and service introductions and transitions.
The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.
The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute
products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major
markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its
retail and online stores and its direct sales force.
Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’
purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the
Company’ s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.
The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’
stores with Company employees and contract ors, and improving product placement display s. These programs can require a
substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these
resellers could stop distributing the Company’ s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’ s products
could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’ s products.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 6
The Company is expos ed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and othe r assets, in addition to purchase
commitment cancellation risk.
The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated
demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizabl e value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders
of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities
and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the
Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of
the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory , capital assets, inventory prepayments and other
assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-
downs, fees, impairmen ts and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in
which the Company competes.
The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.
Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’ s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for
periods up to 150 days . Because the Compan y’s markets are volatile , competitive and subject to rapid technology and price
changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insuf ficient amounts of components or
products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.
Future oper ating results depend upon the Company’ s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially
reasonable terms.
Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant
supply and pricing risks.  Many components, including those that are available from multiple sourc es, are at times subject to industry-
wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely af fect the Company’ s financial condition
and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may
suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry ,
further limiting the Comp any’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercia lly reasonable terms. The effects of
global or regional economic conditions on the Company’ s suppliers, described in “Global and regional economic conditions could
materially adversely affect the Company’ s busin ess, results of operations, financial condition and growth ,” above, also could affect
the Company’ s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and
price increases that could materially adversely af fect its financial condition and operating results.
The Compan y’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses
new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities
have increas ed. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of
reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized
to meet the Company’ s requirements. If the Company’ s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or
constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company , the Company’ s financial
condition and operating results could be materi ally adversely affected. The Company’ s business and financial performance could
also be materially advers ely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and
obtain suf ficient quantities from an alternative source.
The Compa ny depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing
partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.
Substantially all of the Company’ s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A
significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single
locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can
lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’ s direct control over production and distrib ution. Such diminished control may
have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’ s flexibility to respond to changing
conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the
Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects
and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability . While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code
of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur .
The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many
components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substan tially all of the Company’ s hardware
products. Any failure of these partners to perfor m can have a negative impact on the Company’ s cost or supply of components or
finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destina tions can be disrupted for a variety
of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial
disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor , environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 7
The Compan y has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and
has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help
ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial
problems or other disruptions in their business , such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of
manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.
The Company’ s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could
materially adversely af fect the Company’ s business and result in harm to the Company’ s reputation.
The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing
defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company , often have issues that
can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defect s can also exist in components and
products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’ s products unsafe and create a
risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury . These risks may increase as the Company’ s products are introduced
into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’ s service offerings may have quality issues and from
time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’ s servi ces may not perform as anticipated
and may not meet custo mer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and
defects in the hardware, software and services it of fers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues
affecting the Company’ s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product
replacements or modifications, write-of fs of inventory , property , plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant
warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the
experience for users of the Company’ s products and services, and result in harm to the Compa ny’s reputation, loss of competitive
advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and
lost sales.
The Compa ny relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.
The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently
available content. The licensing or other distribu tion arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not
guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content
providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more
difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers
or distributor s may seek to limit the Company’ s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to
continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its
geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on
commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’ s financial condition and operating results.
Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If
requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no
assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner . In addition,
certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights
management, which could lessen the protection  of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements
with the Company’ s content providers.
The Company’ s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.
The Company believes decisions by customers  to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party
software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software
applications and services for the Company’ s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and
maintained for the Company’ s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’ s products.
The Company believes the availability of third- party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the
developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for
the Company’ s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for
personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the
anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications
and services.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 8
The Company’ s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less
inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’ s products and more inclined to devot e their resources to developing and
upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their ef forts on these competing platforms,
the availability and quality of applications for the Company’ s devices may suf fer.
The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its
products. The Company’ s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers
are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes
to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.
The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and
Watch App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these
platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that
the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.
The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property , which may not be available to the Company on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Many of the Company’ s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires
licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently
competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the
Company’ s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to
time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be
obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however , no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on
commercially reasonable  terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property , or to use such intellectual
property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise
have a material adverse impact on the Company’ s financial condition and operating results.
The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on
intellectual property rights .
The Company is subject to various legal procee dings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not
yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes
include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an
indemnified third party .
Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have
generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular , the Company has histo rically faced a significant number of
patent claim s relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other
patent-holding companie s frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of
patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in
courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintif fs in these actions frequently seek
injunctions and substantial damages.
Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’ s operations and
distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other
arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur . These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’ s cost of sales and
operating expenses.
Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments
and Conting encies” under the heading “Contin gencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable
possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss
contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.
The outcome  of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified
third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’ s expectations, the Company’ s financial condition and operating
results for that reportin g period could be materially adversely affected. Further , such an outcome could result in significant
compensatory , punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive
relief against the Company that could materially adversely af fect its financial condition and operating results.
While the Company maintains insurance covera ge for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insuf ficient to cover
all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 9
The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to
potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse ef fects on the Company’ s business.
The Compan y’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to:
antitrust; privacy, data security and data locali zation; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product
liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile
communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and
employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money
laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety .
Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’ s global
operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’ s business by increasing the Company’ s costs,
limiting the Company’ s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’ s business practices or
otherwise making the Company’ s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and
procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’ s
employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Compan y’s policies and procedures. If the
Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’ s reputation, financial
condition and operating results.
The technolo gy industry , including, in some instances, the Company , is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny ,
which expos es the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to
antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the
Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on the Company’ s financial condition and operating
results. There can be no assurance that the Company’ s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the
aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations or changes to laws and regulations in the future.
The Company’ s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of
resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
The Company’ s retail stores have required subs tantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems,
inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have
been designed and built to serve as high-profile  venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements,
locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’ s more typical retail stores. Due to the high
cost structure associated with the Company’ s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual
store or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-of fs of equipment and leasehold improvements and
severance costs.
The Compa ny’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertaintie s and could adversely impact the
Company’ s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general
retail activity . Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’ s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store
construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value
of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.
Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’ s ongoing business and present risks
not originally contemplated.
The Compan y has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve
significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and
expenses, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’ s due diligence. These new ventures
are inherently risky and may not be successful.
The Company’ s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network
disruptions.
The Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents,
power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other
events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’ s
business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities . Such failures or disruptions can
adversely impact the Company’ s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’ s online services, interfering
with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’ s products. These events could materially
adversely af fect the Company’ s reputation, financial condition and operating results.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 10
There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable
information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.
The Company’ s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable
information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’ s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network
and data security , including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But
these measu res cannot provide absolute security , and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur
and could materially adversely af fect the Company’ s reputation, financial condition and operating results.
The Company’ s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the
Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and
losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’ s
reputation, financial condition and operating results.
For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’ s information technology systems that
compromises the confidentiality , integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things,
impair the Company’ s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’ s stock price,
materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in
penalties, fines or judgments against the Company .
Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across
various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the
confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.
The Compa ny has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent
unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all
companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error,
malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce
employees or customers  into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access
the Company’ s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company , the Company monitors its services
and systems for unusual activity and may freeze  accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in
the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’ s products and services.
In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to specific
obligations relating to health data and payme nt card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy , security and breach
notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’ s
compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is
handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’ s agreements with healthcare  institutions, the Company could be
subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur
significant fees or fines.
Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromise d, the Company could be liable for
associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry
data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the
ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standard s, which would materially adversely
affect the Company’ s reputation, financial condition and operating results.
While the Company maintains insurance covera ge that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance
coverage may be insuf ficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
The Company’ s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations
regarding data protection.
The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII.
In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transf ers of PII among the Company and
its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing
additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with
emerging and changing  international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to
change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability .
The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy , information provided on its website
and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international
privacy-related or data protection laws and regul ations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or
others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability .
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 11
The Company’ s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.
Much of the Company’ s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief
Executive Officer, execu tive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high
demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’ s key personnel are
located.
The Compa ny’s busin ess can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural
disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.
Political events, internat ional trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other
business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy , and could have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its customers, suppli ers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers
and other channel partners.
International trade disputes can result in tariffs and other measures that can adversely affect the Company’ s business. For example,
trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’ s
products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin
that the Company earns  on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’ s products more expensive for customers, which could
make the Company’ s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures that could
limit the Company’ s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and
measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’ s
business.
Many of the Company’ s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’ s suppliers and contract
manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities
are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist
attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’ s control. Global climate
change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more  intense effects. Such events could
make it difficult or impos sible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies
in the Comp any’s supp ly and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’ s service offerings.
Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures
to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and
manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative
consequences to the Company .
The Company’ s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the
Company’ s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and
could result in disruption  to the Company’ s business and harm to the Company’ s reputation. Should major public health issues,
including pandemics, arise, the Company could  be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional
limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps
of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company’ s suppliers and contract manufacturers.
While the Company maintains insurance covera ge for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insuf ficient to cover
all losses that may arise.
The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate.
The Company’ s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example,
gross margi ns on the Company’ s hardware products vary across product lines and can chang e over time. The Company’ s gross
margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product
pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the
Company’ s ability to effectively stimulate deman d for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential
increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and acquiring and delivering content for the Company’ s
services; the Company’ s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services,
or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or
services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other facto rs could have a materially adverse
impact on the Company’ s financial condition and operating results.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 12
The Company has histor ically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part
to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly  impact net sales, cost of sales and
operating expenses. Further , the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in
demand for that produ ct could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected
developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’ s products or services, issues with new product or service
introductions, informatio n technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’ s logistics,
components supply , or manufacturing partners.
The Company’ s stock price is subject to volatility .
The Compa ny’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future.
Additionally , the Company , the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and
volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelate d to these companies’ operating
performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed
the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect  expectations of future growth and
profitability . The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current
levels or grow , and that its current share repurch ase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration
by the Company’ s Board of Directors, and the Company’ s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific
number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability , dividends, share repurchases or
other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly , which could have a material adverse impact on investor
confidence and employee retention.
The Company’ s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
local currencies.
The Company’ s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales,
cost of sales  and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’ s products in foreign countries and on products
that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations.
The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’ s foreign
currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing
demand for the Company’ s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise
international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar ’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins
the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.
Conversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar , while generally beneficial to the Company’ s foreign
currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign
currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the
Company’ s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely af fecting gross margins.
The Compan y uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a
portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavo rable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in
place.
The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.
The Compa ny’s investm ents can be negatively  affected by liquidity , credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic
conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’ s
cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially . Therefore, although the
Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future
fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’ s financial
condition and operating results.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 13
The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments
related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.
The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company
also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A
substantial majority of the Company’ s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or
financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company’ s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is
higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor
non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-
assemblies or assemble final products for the Company . In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term
supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2019 , a significant portion of the Company’ s
trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to
long-term supply agreem ents were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primar ily in Asia. While the Company has
procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term
prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will ef fectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.
The Compa ny could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or
exposure to additional tax liabilities.
The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’ s
subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdi ctions may be subject to significant
change. The Company’ s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory
tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the
U.S. and Ireland.
The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and
other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from
these exami nations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these
examinations. If the Com pany’ s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination
of the Comp any’s taxes  owed is for an amount  in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’ s financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely af fected.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 2. Properties
The Company’ s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 28, 2019 , the Compa ny owned or leased
facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in
various places outside the U.S. The Company  believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable
segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
The Company is subjec t to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at
least a reasonable poss ibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,
concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
The outcom e of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period for amounts above management’ s expectations, the Company’ s financial condition and operating results for that reporting
period could be materia lly adversely affected. Refer to the risk factor “The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of
legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights ” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the
heading “Risk Factors.” The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2019  that did not individually or in the
aggregate have a material impact on the Company’ s financial condition or operating results.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable.

Fiscal 2019  Highlights
Total net sales decreased  2% or $5.4 billion  during 2019 compared to 2018, driven by lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by
higher net sales of Wearables, Home and Acces sories and Services in all geographic operating segments. The weakness in foreign
currencies had a significant unfavorable impact on net sales during 2019.
In April 2019, the Company announced an incre ase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175
billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share beginning in May 2019. During 2019, the Company

Total net sales $ 260,174  (2)% $ 265,595  16% $ 229,234
Americas
Americas net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher Services and Wearables, Home and
Accessories net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign curre ncies relative to the U.S. dollar had
an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during 2019.
Europe
Europe net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables,
Home and Accessories and Services net sales . The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significant
unfavorable impact on Europe net sales during 2019.
Greater China
Greater China net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone  net sales, partially offset by higher
Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an
unfavorable impact on Greater China net sales during 2019.
Japan
Japan net sales decrea sed during 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and
Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales. The value of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on

Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were as follows (dollars in millions):
 2019  2018  2017
Gross margin:      
Products $ 68,887  $ 77,683  $ 70,197

Total gross margin percentage 37.8% 38.3% 38.5%
Products Gross Margin
Products gross margin and Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower
iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar .
Products gross margin increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to a favorable shift in mix of iPhones and the strength
in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar , partially offset by higher product cost structures. Year-over-year Products gross
margin percentage decreased during 2018 due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by the strength in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar .
Services Gross Margin
Year-over-year Services  gross margin increased  during 2019 and 2018 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different
services mix. Year-over-year Services gross margin percentage increased during 2019 and 2018  due primarily to a different services
mix and leverage of the Company’ s services fixed cost structure from higher Services net sales.
The Company’ s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under
the heading “Risk Facto rs”. As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain
under downward pressure.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were as follows (dollars in millions):
 2019  Change  2018  Change  2017
Research and development $ 16,217  14% $ 14,236  23% $ 11,581

Percentage of total net sales 13%   12%   12%
Research and Development
The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company
continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and
to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’ s core business strategy .
Selling, General and Administrative
The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-
related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising and infrastructure-related costs.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 21
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2019 , 2018  and 2017  was as follows (dollars in millions):
 2019  Change  2018  Change  2017
Interest and dividend income $ 4,961    $ 5,686    $ 5,201
Interest expense (3,576 )   (3,240 )   (2,323 )
Other income/(expense), net 422    (441)   (133)
Total other income/(expense), net $ 1,807  (10)% $ 2,005  (27)% $ 2,745
The year-ov er-year decrease in OI&E during 2019 was due primarily to lower interest income and higher interest expense, partially
offset by the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.19% and 2.16% in 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
Provision for Income T axes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were as follows (dollars
in millions):
 2019  2018  2017
Provision for income taxes $ 10,481  $ 13,372  $ 15,738
Effective tax rate 15.9% 18.3% 24.6%
Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0% 24.5% 35.0%
On December 22, 2017,  the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act
lowered the Company’ s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a
deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory
federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain
foreign earnings.
The Company’ s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on
foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’ s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the
2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred
tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.
The Company’ s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in
2019 and the impact of the Act in 2018, partially of fset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019.
As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits
of $14.3 billion  and deferre d tax liabilities of $6.2 billion . Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing
taxable temp orary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Com pany will continue to evaluate the
amount of the valuation allowance, if any , by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Hedging
In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities  (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12
expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the
separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020
utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company’ s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the
adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the F ASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments  (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measu rement of expected credit losses on certain financial
instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016 -13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method.
Based on the composition of the Company’ s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity , the
adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 22
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for
lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method
through a cumulative-ef fect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates
recording lease-related assets and liabilities of approximately $8 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with no
material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Capital Assets
The Company’ s capital expenditures were $7.6 billion  during 2019 , which included product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment; data centers; corporate facilities  and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and
enhancements; and retail store facilities.
Debt
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The
Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share
repurchases. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had $6.0 billion  of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average
interest rate of 2.24%  and maturities generally less than nine months .
As of September 28, 2019 , the Compa ny had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate
principal amount of $101.7 billion  (colle ctively the “Notes” ). During 2019 , the Company issued $7.0 billion  and repaid $8.8 billion  of
Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter , into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In
addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter , into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the
Notes.
Further information regarding the Company’ s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form
10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.”
Capital Return Program
On April 30, 2019, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the current share repurchase program authorization
from $100 billion  to $175 billion  of the Company’ s common stock, of which $96.1 billion  had been utilized as of September 28, 2019 .
During 2019 , the Company repurchased 345.2 million  shares of its common stock for $67.1 billion , including 62.0 million  shares
delivered under a $12.0 billion  ASR dated February 2019, which settled in August 2019. The Company’ s share repurchase program
does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares  may be repurchased in privately
negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
On April 30, 2019, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’ s quarterly cash dividend from $0.73 to
$0.77 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2019. The Company  intends to increase its dividend on
an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.

Operating Leases
The Compan y’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-
year renewal options.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’ s products and to perform final
assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand
information supplied by the Company , which typically covers periods up to 150 days . The Comp any also obtains individual
components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 24
Other Purchase Obligations
The Compan y’s other purchase obligations cons ist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling
and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertis ing, licensing, R&D, Internet and
telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.
Deemed Repatriation T ax Payable
As of September 28, 2019 , a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’ s Consolidated Balance Sheet
consisted of the deeme d repatriation tax payab le imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax
payable in installments in accordance with the Act.
Other Non-Current Liabilities
The Compa ny’s remain ing other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual
obligation table.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The prepara tion of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. gener ally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) and the Company’ s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’ s
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidate d Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant
accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’ s consolidated financial statements. Management bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
these estimates, and such dif ferences may be material.
Management believes the Company’ s critical accounting policies and estimates are those relate d to revenue recognition, valuation
of manufacturing-related  assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes,
and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of
the Company’ s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
inherently uncertain matters. The Company’ s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related
disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’ s Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition
The Compan y has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangem ents involving the sale of iPhone,
Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated
sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to
receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to
receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device.
The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone
selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of
revenue is based on the Company’ s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified
software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be
provided.
The Company’ s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’ s judgment and considers multiple factors that may
vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and
circumstances change, the Company’ s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and
unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the
nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the
estimated period they are expected to be provided.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 25
Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees
The Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments
provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory . The Company also
accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have  been canceled or are expected to
be canceled . The Company’ s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are the key inputs in the
determination of the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase
commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimat ed demand for one or more of the
Company’ s products, a change in the Company’ s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological
requirements for any of the Company’ s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of
manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees.
Warranty Costs
The Company offers limited warranties on its new hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and
customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the Company’ s hardware products. The
Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognize d based on historical and projected
warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the Company’ s typical
experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary . If actual product failure rates or
repair costs dif fer from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required.
Income T axes
The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of
uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with
management’ s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’ s financial condition and operating results.
Legal and Other Contingencies
As discusse d in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal
proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss
has been incurred and the amount is reasonab ly estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as
described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Stateme nts in Note 10, “Commitments and
Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the
Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for
asserted legal and other claims.
The outcom e of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period for amounts above management’ s expectations, the Company’ s financial condition and operating results for that reporting
period could be materially adversely af fected.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management
The Compan y regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone
basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the
Company’ s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further , the
recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the
underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely af fect the Company’ s financial condition and operating results.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’ s exposure to changes in interest  rates relates primarily to the Company’ s investment portfolio and outstanding debt.
While the Company is exposed to global interest  rate fluctuations, the Company’ s interest income and expense are most sensitive to
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’ s cash, cash equivalents
and marketa ble securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the
Company’ s debt.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 26
The Compan y’s investm ent policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’ s liquidity
requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and
achieve its investment objectives. The Company  typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing
the potential risk of principal loss. The Company ’s investment policy generally requires securitie s to be investment grade and limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue r. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the
Company’ s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates
would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment
positions as of September 28, 2019  and September 29, 2018 , a hypothet ical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all
maturities would result in a $2.8 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively . Such
losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity .
As of September 28, 2019  and September 29, 2018 , the Compa ny had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying
maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $102.1 billion  and $102.5 billion , respectively . The Company has entered, and in the
future may enter , into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the
Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payme nts into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments.
Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100
basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’ s debt as of September 28, 2019  and
September 29, 2018  to increase by $325 million and $399 million on an annualized basis, respectively .
Foreign Currency Risk
In general, the Compan y is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Accordingly , changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar , will negatively affect the Company’ s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.
dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competi tive pressures when there has been
significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Compa ny may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash
flows and net investmen ts in foreign subsidiarie s. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter , into foreign
currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt
issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and
inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However , the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange
exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
particular exposures.
To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’ s foreign currency derivative positions,
the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in
exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thous ands of random market price paths
assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the
Company’ s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent
actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company
estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019 , comp ared to a
maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of September 29, 2018 . Because the Company uses foreign currency
instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair
value of the underlying exposures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’ s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ
materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 28, 2019  due to the inherent limitations associated with
predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’ s actual exposures
and positions.

Apple Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 –  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the
Company’ s managemen t, the consolidated finan cial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature,
necessary for fair financ ial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’ s presentation.
The Company’ s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . The Company’ s fiscal years
2019 and 2018 spanned  52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first fiscal
quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’ s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise
stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’ s fiscal years ended in September and the
associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’ s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU  2014 -09”), and additional ASUs issued to
clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for
revenue recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The
Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as the adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a
material impact on previously reported amounts.
Additionally , beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and
free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales.
Historically , the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management
reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the 2019
presentation.
Financial Instruments
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10):
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a
material impact on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements.
Income T axes
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of
Assets Othe r Than Inventory  (“ASU 2016-16”), which  requires the recognitio n of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity
transfer of an asset, other than inventory , when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified
retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $2.7 billion  of net deferred tax assets, reduced other non-
current assets by $128 million , and increased retained earnings by $2.6 billion  on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will
recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.
Restricted Cash
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flow s (Topic 230): Restricted  Cash
(“ASU 2016 -18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the
statement of cash flows and requires additional disclosures about restricted cash balances.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 34
Share-Based Compensation
The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’ s common stock on the
date of grant, and recog nizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further
information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”
Earnings Per Share
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2019 , 2018  and 2017  (net income in millions
and shares in thousands):
 2019  2018  2017
Numerator:      
Net income $ 55,256  $ 59,531  $ 48,351
      
Denominator:      
Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,617,834  4,955,377  5,217,242
Effect of dilutive securities 31,079  44,732  34,450
Weighted-average diluted shares 4,648,913  5,000,109 5,251,692
      
Basic earnings per share $ 11.97  $ 12.01  $ 9.27
Diluted earnings per share $ 11.89  $ 11.91  $ 9.21
The Compan y applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.  Potentially dilutive
securities representing 15.5 million  shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for
2019  because their ef fect would have been antidilutive.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
The Company’ s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accou nted for as available-for-sale. The
Company classifies its marketable debt secur ities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’ s underlying
contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized
in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).
The Company’ s investments in marketable equit y securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability
for use in current operations. The Company’ s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses
recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).
The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.
Inventories
Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.
Property , Plant and Equipment
Depreciation on property , plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years  or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years  for machinery
and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for
leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets , which range from three to five years . Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment
was $11.3 billion , $9.3 billion  and $8.2 billion  during 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively .
Non-cash investing activities involving property , plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and
other current liabilities of $(2.9) billion  and $3.4 billion  during 2019  and 2018 , respectively .
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 35
Non-Marketable Securities
The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As
such, the Company’ s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in
fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer . Gains and losses on non-
marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E.
Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities
The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The
Company records restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current
classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or
non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities .
Fair V alue Measurements
The fair values of the Company’ s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’ s debt instruments and all
other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or
model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Note 2 – Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at
the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is
generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership
of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’ s Products  net sales, control transfers when
products are shipped. For the Company’ s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for
Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of
services, as applicable.
The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer
incentive programs based on the Company’ s expectations and historical experience.
For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being
distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices
(“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available,
SSPs are established that reflect the Company’ s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if
they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’ s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers
multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including,
where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-
specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.
The Company has ident ified up to three  performanc e obligation s regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone,
Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated
sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to
receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to
receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device.
The Compan y allocates revenue and any related  discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because
the Compan y lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the
Company’ s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has
transferred to the custom er, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled
services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they
are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs,
are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services  and unspecified software upgrade
rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.
For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For
these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any
unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly , the Company has not recognized
revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 36
For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer , the
Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when
determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the
product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring accepta bility of the product. For third-party
applications sold through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store and certain digital content sold through
the Compan y’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer .
Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.
The Company has elect ed to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities,
with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority .
Deferred Revenue
As of September 28, 2019  and September 29, 2018 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $8.1 billion  and $8.8 billion ,
respectively . As of September 28, 2019 , the Company expects 68% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25%
within one-to-two years, 6% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.
Disaggregated Revenue
Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were as follows (in millions):
 2019  2018  2017
iPhone  (1) $ 142,381  $ 164,888  $ 139,337

of the respective product.
(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and
Apple-branded and third-party accessories.
(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare, licensing and other
services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the
sales price of certain products.
(4)Includes $5.9 billion of revenue recognized in 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018, $5.8 billion of
revenue recognized in 2018 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2017, and $6.3 billion of revenue recognized in
2017 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2016.
The Company’ s proportion of net sales by disag gregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in
Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2019 , 2018  and 2017 .

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited
to, managing liquidity , credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’ s long-term marketable debt
securities generally range from one to five years .
The following tables show information about the Company’ s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss
position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of September 28, 2019  and September 29, 2018  (in millions):
 2019

Fair value of marketable securities $ 126,238  $ 60,599  $ 186,837
Unrealized losses $ (2,400 ) $ (1,889 ) $ (4,289 )
The Compan y typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
The Company’ s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one issuer . Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable
debt security  for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair
value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’ s intent to
sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of
September 28, 2019 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
Non-Marketable Securities
The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As
of September 28, 2019 , the Company’ s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $2.9 billion .
Restricted Cash
A reconciliation of the Company’ s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as of September 28, 2019  is as follows (in millions):
 2019
Cash and cash equivalents $ 48,844
Restricted cash included in other current assets 23
Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,357
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 50,224
The Company’ s restricted cash primarily consist ed of cash required to be on deposit under a contractual agreement with a bank to
support the Company’ s iPhone Upgrade Program.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected
future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However , the Company
may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the
prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedg es will offset more than a portion of
the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’ s subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue , and subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional
currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instrum ents to manage this risk and may
designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency
exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months .
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 39
To protect the net investment in a foreign opera tion from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter
into foreign currency forward and option contrac ts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments
due to fluctu ations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-d erivative financial instruments, such
as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases,
the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.
To protect the Company ’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may
offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these
instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2019 , the Compa ny’s hedged term debt– and market able
securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 23 years .
The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portio n of the foreign currency exchange
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
To protect the Company’ s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the
Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in
interest income or expen se, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company’ s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 8 years .
Cash Flow Hedges
The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the
hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are
recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses
related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related
costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses  associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in
OI&E in the same period  as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designate d as cash flow hedges, changes in
the time value are excluded from the assessme nt of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the
effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in OI&E.
Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occu r in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-mon th time period. Deferred gains and
losses in AOCI associa ted with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any
subsequent changes in fair value of such deriva tive instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of
other transactions.
Net Investment Hedges
The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The
ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in OI&E. For
foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to
changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Accordingl y, any gains or losses related to this
forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.
Fair V alue Hedges
Gains and losses related  to changes in fair value  hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related
to the change in value of the underlying hedge d item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign
exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the
forward carry componen t from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amount excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair
value hedges was a gain of $777 million  for 2019 , and was recognized in OI&E.
Non-Designated Derivatives
Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line
item to which the derivative relates.

The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transac tion volume outstanding and do not
represent the amount of the Company’ s exposu re to credit or market loss. The credit risk amou nts represent the Company’ s gross
exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform
according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’ s
exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates chang e. Although the table above reflects
the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’ s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with
the exposur es and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of
these financ ial instrumen ts, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions
during the remaining life of the instruments.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 42
The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net
settlement of transactions with the same coun terparty . To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral
security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments
fluctuates from contract ually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their
gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 28, 2019 , the net cash collateral received by the Company
related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.6 billion , which was recorded as other current
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 29, 2018 , the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to
derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion , which  was recorded as other current assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’ s derivative contracts, the Company is
allowed to net settle transactions with a single  net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 28, 2019  and
September 29, 2018 , the potential effects of these rights of set-of f associated with the Company’ s derivative contracts, including the
effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilitie s of $2.7 billion  and $2.1 billion ,
respectively , resulting in a net derivative liability of $407 million  and a net derivative asset of $138 million , respectively .
Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has cons iderable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,
resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not
require collateral from its customers; however , the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to
limit credit risk. In additi on, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for
certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit  exposure. These credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer . As such, the Company generally does
not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As
of September 29, 2018 , the Company had one customer that represen ted 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted
for 10%. The Company’ s cellular network carriers accounted for 51% and 59% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019
and September 29, 2018 , respectively .
Vendor Non-T rade Receivables
The Compan y has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company . The Company purchases these components
directly from suppliers. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total
vendor non-trade receiv ables, which accounted for 59% and 14%. As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had two vendors that
individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62% and 12%.

U.S. T ax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017,  the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act
lowered the Company’ s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a
deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings,
for which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The Compa ny complete d its accounting for
the income tax effects of the Act during 2019, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting

The Compan y’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For restricted stock
units (“RSUs”), the Com pany receives an income tax benefit upon the award’ s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying
stock’ s fair market value . Prior to 2018, the Company reflected net excess tax benefits from equity awards as increases to additional
paid-in capital, which amounted to $620 million  in 2017 .

Uncertain T ax Positions
As of September 28, 2019 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.6 billion , of which $8.6 billion , if recognized,
would impact the Company’ s effective tax rate. As of September 29, 2018 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
$9.7 billion , of which $7.4 billion , if recognized, would have impacted the Company’ s effective tax rate.
The aggrega te change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2019 , 2018  and
2017 , is as follows (in millions):
 2019  2018  2017
Beginning balances $ 9,694  $ 8,407  $ 7,724
Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 5,845  2,431  333

Ending balances $ 15,619  $ 9,694  $ 8,407
The Company is subje ct to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign
jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all
years before  2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination
by the taxin g authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result
from tax examinations. However , the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certain ty. If any issues addressed in the
Company’ s tax audits are resolved in a manne r inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its
provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not
certain, the Company believes it is reasonably  possible that its gross unrecognized tax bene fits could decrease in the next 12
months by as much as $2.0 billion .
Interest and Penalties
The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes.  As of
September 28, 2019  and September 29, 2018 , the total amount of gross interest and penaltie s accrued was $1.3 billion  and $1.4
billion , respectivel y. The Company recognized interest  and penalty expense in 2019 , 2018  and 2017  of $73 million , $489 million  and
$238 million , respectively .
European Commission State Aid Decision
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing
tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsid iaries of the Company (the
“State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the
period June 2003 throu gh December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion , plus interest of €1.2 billion .
During the fourth quarte r of 2019, the Irish Minis ter for Finance approved the Company’ s request to reduce the recovery amount by
€190 million  due to taxes paid to other countries, resulting in an adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion  as of September 28, 2019.
Irish legislative changes, effective as of Januar y 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The
Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the
European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate
income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax
credit limitations in the Act. As of September 28, 2019 , the entire adjusted recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow ,
where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all appeals. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and
Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.

To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into
interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest
rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally , to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes,
the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to ef fectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.
A portion of the Company’ s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the
Company’ s net investment in a foreign operation. As of September 28, 2019  and September 29, 2018 , the carrying value of the debt
designated as a net investment hedge was $1.0 billion  and $811 million , respective ly. For further discussion regarding the
Company’ s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.”

Note 9 – Benefit Plans
2014 Employee Stock Plan
In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the
Company’ s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for
broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-
based awards, stock options and stock apprec iation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan
generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’ s common
stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by
a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations
increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or
shares withheld. Currently , all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of
RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and
conditions as the corres ponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval
of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million  share s plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued
under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or
are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of
September 28, 2019 , approximately 246.4  million  shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.
Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan
The Apple Inc. Non-Emp loyee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approve d plan that (i) permits the Company
to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’ s non-employee directors, (ii) provides  for automatic initial grants of RSUs
upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of
shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and
RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’ s common
stock subjec t to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval.
RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the
number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027 . All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to
DERs. DERs are subjec t to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are
accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 28, 2019 , approximately 1.1 million  shares were  reserved
for future issuance under the Director Plan.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 49
Rule 10b5-1 T rading Plans
During the three month s ended September 28, 2019 , Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre
O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 (c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An
equity tradin g plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the
amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’ s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’ s
employee and director equity plans.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purcha se the Company’ s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employ ee’s payroll deductions under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’ s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000  of stock
during any calendar year. As of September 28, 2019 , approximately 31.1 million  shares were reserved for future issuance under the
Purchase Plan.
401(k) Plan
The Company’ s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary  arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k)
Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($19,000  for
calendar year 2019 ). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’ s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a
maximum of 6% of the employee’ s eligible earnings.
Restricted Stock Units
A summary of the Company’ s RSU activity and related information for 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , is as follows:

RSUs granted 50,112  $ 121.65   
RSUs vested (45,735 ) $ 95.48   
RSUs canceled (5,895 ) $ 106.87   
Balance as of September 30, 2017 97,571  $ 110.33   
RSUs granted 45,351  $ 162.86   
RSUs vested (44,718 ) $ 111.24

RSUs granted 36,852  $ 215.95   
RSUs vested (42,088 ) $ 135.21   
RSUs canceled (5,402 ) $ 162.85   
Balance as of September 28, 2019 81,517  $ 169.18  $ 17,838
The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $8.6 billion , $7.6 billion  and $6.1 billion  for 2019 , 2018  and 2017 ,
respectively . The majority of RSUs that vested in 2019 , 2018  and 2017  were net share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the
cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 14.8 million , 16.0 million  and 15.4 million  for
2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectivel y, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the
Company’ s closing stock  price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $3.0 billion , $2.7 billion
and $2.0 billion  in 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively . These net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the
Company as they reduc ed the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not
represent an expense to the Company .

The Compan y offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase  a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the
U.K. and mainland China . The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount
when purcha sing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee
liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability
recognized within net sales.
Concentrations in the A vailable Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
Although most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components
are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in
the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the
Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant
commodity pricing fluctuations.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the
Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,
initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufactur ing capacities have increased. The
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’ s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however , there can be no guarantee that the
Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Substantially all of the Company’ s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia,
with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.
Other Off–Balance Sheet Commitments
Operating Leases
The Compan y leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancela ble operating lease arrangements.
The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements . As of September 28, 2019 , the
Company’ s total future minimum lease paymen ts under noncancelable operating leases were $10.8 billion . The Comp any’s retail
store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years  and generally contain multi-year renewal options.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 51
Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $1.3 billion , $1.2 billion  and $1.1
billion  in 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , respectively . Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or
remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 28, 2019 , are as follows (in millions):

Thereafter 5,373
Total $ 10,838
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services
(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’ s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier
arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments under
noncancelable unconditi onal purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2019 , are as
follows (in millions):
2020 $ 2,476

Contingencies
The Company is subject  to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have
not been fully resolved.  The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the
Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’ s expectations, the Company’ s financial condition and operating
results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a
reasonable possibility the Company may have  incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,
concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:
VirnetX
VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District
Court”) again st the Company alleging that certai n Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network
communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the
Company and awarded damages of $302 million , which later increased to $440 million  in post-trial proceedings. The Company
appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury
returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million . VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The
Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the
PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal
Circuit consolidated the Company’ s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’ s appeals from the PTO
invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further
appeal. On July 8, 2019, the Federal Circuit remanded one of VirnetX’ s two appeals of the PTO’s invalidity decisions back to the
PTO for further proceed ings. On August 1, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, vacated- in-part, and remanded back to the
PTO portions of V irnetX’ s second appeal. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 52
Qualcomm
On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S.
District Cour t for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualco mm from requiring the Company to
pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm . No Qualcomm-related royalty payments had been remitted by the Company to its
contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. Following the Compa ny’s lawsuit, Qualcomm filed patent
infringement suits against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, some of which sought to
enjoin the sale of certain of the Company’ s products in particular countries.
On April 16, 2019, the Company and Qualcomm reached a settlement agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies
worldwide. The companies also reached a multi-year license agreement and a multi-year supply  agreement. Under the terms of the
settlement agreement, Apple made a payment to Qualcomm to, among other things, resolve disputes over the withheld royalty
payments.
iOS Performance Management Cases
Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging
violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’ s performance
management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The
claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated
through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the North ern District of California. In addition
to civil litigation, the Company is also respon ding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the
performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective,  that the performance management
feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve custom ers’ user experience, and that the
Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best
estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.
French Competition Authority
In June 2019, the French  Competition Authority (“FCA”) issued a report alleging that aspects of the Company’ s sales and distribution
practices in France violate French competition law. The Company vigorously disagrees with the allegations, and a hearing of
arguments was held before the FCA on October 15, 2019. The Company is awaiting the decisio n of the FCA, which may include a
fine.
Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the
internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’ s reportable
segments.
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’ s reportable segments consist of the Americas,
Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes
European countries, as well as India, the Middl e East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of
Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian  countries not included in the Company’ s other reportable segments. Although the
reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better
align with the location of the Company’ s custom ers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic
region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.”
The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’ s retail stores located in
those geogr aphic locati ons. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in
which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses
managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses
such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based comp ensation expenses, income taxes,
various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include
intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

of Apple Inc. The decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from Apple
Inc. for the period from June 2003 through December 2014. The adjusted amount indicated by
the EC to be recovered is up to €12.9 billion, plus interest.
Auditing management’ s evaluation of the uncert ain tax position stemming from the effects of
the EC decision is complex and highly judgment al due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting
the ultimate resolution of the matter .
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 56
How W e Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the risk of material misstatement relating to the evaluation of the EC
state aid matter , including management’ s evaluation of the advice of legal counsel, the
assessment as to whether Apple Inc.’s position is more likely than not to be sustained and the
development of the related disclosure.
To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of whethe r sustainment of its position is a more likely
than not outcome, including underlying assumptions, our audit procedures included, among
others, reading the EC August 2016 ruling and available correspondence between Apple Inc.
and the EC, and the EC and Ireland. We also requested and received internal and external
legal counse l confirmation letters, discussed the allegations with internal and external legal
counsel and Apple Inc. tax personnel and obtained a representation letter from Apple Inc. We
involved our EC and tax subject matter resourc es in considering the applicable tax laws, the
pending appeal, the current status of legal precedent relevant to that appeal and the
proceedings at the court hearing in September  2019. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s
disclosure included in Note 5 in relation to this matter .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2019 , base d on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinio n, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of September 28, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the
“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 28, 2019  and September 29, 2018 , the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 28, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated October 30, 2019  expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
Apple Inc. in accordanc e with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit  in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial repor ting is a process designed to provide reasonabl e assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with author izations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that
could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’ s management, the Company’ s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’ s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules 13a-1 5(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Excha nge Act were effective as of September 28, 2019  to provide reasonable assurance
that informa tion required  to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized  and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and
communicated to the Company’ s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls
The Company’ s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Company’ s assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP , and that the Company’ s receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of the Company’ s management and directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
Management, including the Company’ s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’ s
internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assuranc e that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation  of the effectiveness of controls in
future perio ds are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate  because of changes in business
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’ s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f ) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’ s
internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’ s assessment,
management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2019  to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP . The Company’ s independent registered  public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the
Company’ s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2019 , which were
identified in connection with management’ s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act, that have materially af fected, or are reasonably likely to materially af fect, the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting.
