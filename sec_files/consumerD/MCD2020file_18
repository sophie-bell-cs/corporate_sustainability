ABOUT  McDONALD'S
McDonald’ s Corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company ." The Company , its franchisees
and suppliers, are referred to herein as the "System."
BUSINESS SUMMARY
a. General
Effective January 1, 2019, McDonald's operates under an organizational structure designed to support the Company's ef forts toward
efficiently driving growth through the V elocity Growth Plan (the "Plan"). The Company’ s reporting segments are aligned with its strategic
priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United
States ("U.S.") and International Operated Markets. In addition, throughout this report we present the International Developmental
Licensed Markets & Corporate segment, which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities.
b. Description of business
•General
The Company franchises and operates McDonald’ s restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and beverages in 119
countries. Of the 38,695 restaurants at year-end 2019, 36,059 were franchised, which is 93% of McDonald's restaurants.
McDonald’ s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise,
developmental license or af filiate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on
a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local
legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. The business relationship between
McDonald’ s and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies and is of fundamental importance to
overall performance and to protecting the McDonald’ s brand.
The Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer
experiences and driving profitability . Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment
related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald’ s global brand, operating system and
financial resources.
Directly operating McDonald’ s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor . One of the strengths of
the franchising model is that the expertise from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonald’ s to improve the operations and
success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, ef ficiently implemented across relevant
restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations
training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to
further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit
McDonald’ s restaurants.
The Company’ s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees.
Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any , and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and
operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
Conventional Franchise
Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for
the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and décor . The Company believes that ownership of real
estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest
in the industry .
Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of
certain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems.
These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business
performance, and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating
restaurants.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 3
The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business
relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all McDonald’ s restaurants. Conventional franchisees
contribute to the Company’ s revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified
minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure
enables McDonald’ s to generate significant and predictable levels of cash flow .
Developmental License or Affiliate
Under a developmental license or af filiate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing the business, providing
capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any
capital under a developmental license or af filiate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally
receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license.
While developmental license and af filiate arrangements are largely the same, af filiate arrangements are used in a limited number of
foreign markets (primarily China and Japan) where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated af filiates.
•Supply chain, food safety, and quality assurance
The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment, and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The
Company has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards. The Company has quality centers around the world
designed to promote consistency of its high standards. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also
on-site supplier visits. A Food Safety Advisory Council, composed of the Company’ s internal food safety experts, as well as suppliers and
outside academia, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety . We have ongoing programs to educate employees
about food safety practices, and our suppliers and restaurant operators participate in food safety trainings where we share best practices
on food safety and quality . In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous
improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers
toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term.
Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company , distribute products and supplies to McDonald’ s
restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of food for customers.
•Products
McDonald’ s restaurants of fer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences
and tastes.
McDonald’ s menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken
sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, McDonald's Fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies,
soft drinks, cof fee, McCafé beverages and other beverages.
McDonald’ s restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets of fer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast of ferings may
include Egg McMuf fin, Sausage McMuf fin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes.
In addition to these menu items, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions.
Taste, quality , choice and nutrition are important to our customers, and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers'
needs, including testing new products on an ongoing basis.
•Marketing
McDonald’ s global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonald’ s brand
and dif ferentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional ef forts focus on value, quality , food taste, menu choice,
nutrition, convenience and the customer experience.
•Intellectual property
The Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade
secrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the "McDonald's" trademark and the Golden Arches Logo to be of
material importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are
used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations.
•Seasonal operations
The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.
•Working capital practices
Information about the Company’ s working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference from Management’ s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017  on pages 6 through 21
and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017  on page 37 of this Form 10-K.
•Customers
The Company’ s business is not dependent upon either a single customer or small group of customers.
•Government contracts
No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at government election.
•Competition
McDonald’ s restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. The Company competes on the
basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry .
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 4
In measuring the Company’ s competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source
of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry . The Company’ s primary competition, which is referred to as the informal
eating out ("IEO") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: limited-service restaurants
(which combines quick-service eating establishments and 100% home delivery/takeaway providers), street stalls or kiosks, cafés,
specialist cof fee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve
alcohol and full-service restaurants other than providers with limited table service.
Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately 9 million  outlets and
generated $1.2 trillion  in annual sales in 2018 , the most recent year for which data is available. McDonald’ s Systemwide 2018  restaurant
business accounted for 0.4%  of those outlets and 8.2%  of the sales.
Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonald’ s against the entire restaurant industry , including the IEO segment defined
above and all full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of
approximately 20 million  outlets and generated $2.7 trillion  in annual sales in 2018 . McDonald’ s Systemwide restaurant business
accounted for 0.2%  of those outlets and 3.6%  of the sales.
•Environmental matters
The Company continuously monitors developments related to environmental matters, and endeavors to improve its social responsibility
and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability , which benefits McDonald’ s and the communities it serves.
Actual or perceived ef fects of changes in weather patterns, climate, water resources, or packaging waste could have a direct or
indirect impact on the operations of the System in ways which we cannot fully predict at this time.
The Company launched a framework in 2018, which includes the environment-related pillars of climate action, packaging and
recycling, beef sustainability , and other sustainable sourcing ef forts. These include goals and initiatives to reduce System greenhouse gas
emissions, responsibly source ingredients and packaging, and increase the availability of recycling in restaurants to reduce waste, which
the Company recognizes are also increasingly important to customers.
The Company monitors environment-related governmental initiatives and consumer preferences, and plans to respond in a timely and
appropriate manner . Increased focus by certain governmental authorities or consumers on environmental matters may lead to new
governmental initiatives or opportunities. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact
our business both directly and indirectly . Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of
new regulations may increase costs or operational complexity for the Company .
•Number of employees
The Company’ s number of employees worldwide, including its corporate and other of fice employees as well as Company-owned and
operated restaurant employees, was approximately 205,000  as of year-end 2019 .
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 5
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESUL TS OF
OPERA TIONS
MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS
In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and
financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP , including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide
sales growth, return on incremental invested capital ("ROIIC"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below .
Management believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company .
•Constant currency results exclude the ef fects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at
prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the ef fect of foreign currency
translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as income tax provision adjustments related to the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 ("T ax Act"), and bases incentive compensation plans on these results, because the Company believes this
better represents underlying business trends.
•Comparable sales represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least
thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or
remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and,
since 2017, also exclude sales from V enezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets
as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes
in guest counts and average check, which is af fected by changes in pricing and product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively
balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.
•Comparable guest counts represent the number of transactions at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by
franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed.
•Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are
not recorded as revenues by the Company , management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’ s
financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are
indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants
and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and af filiates.
•ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the
markets, the ef fectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in
operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily
capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.
•Free cash flow , defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free
cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’ s ability to convert net
profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder
value.
2019 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
In 2019, global comparable sales increased 5.9%  and global comparable guest counts increased 1.0% , reflecting the continued execution
against the V elocity Growth Plan.
•Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 5.0% and comparable guest counts decreased 1.9%. The increase in comparable sales
reflected strong sales of our iconic core products driven by promotional activity and the continued positive impact from our
Experience of the Future ("EOTF") deployment, as well as menu price increases.
•Comparable sales in the International Operated segment increased 6.1% and comparable guest counts increased 3.5%, reflecting
positive results across all markets, primarily driven by the U.K. and France.
•Comparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment increased 7.2% and comparable guest counts increased
2.2%, reflecting positive sales performance across all geographic regions.
In addition to improved comparable sales and guest count performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2019:
•Consolidated revenues were relatively flat with the prior year (increased 3% in constant currencies) at $21.1 billion.
•Systemwide sales increased  4% (7% in constant currencies) to $100.2 billion .
•Consolidated operating income increased  3% (6% in constant currencies). Excluding the impact of current year and prior year
impairment and strategic charges, operating income increased 1% (4% in constant currencies). Refer to the Operating Income
section on page 15 for additional details.
•Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased  from 42.0%  in 2018  to 43.0%  in 2019 .
Excluding the items referenced in the previous bullet point, operating margin increased from 43.1% in 2018 to 43.4% in 2019.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 6
•Diluted earnings per share of $7.88  increased  5% (7% in constant currencies). Refer to the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per
Share section on page 10 for additional details.
•Cash provided by operations  was $8.1 billion .
•Capital expenditures of $2.4 billion  were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new
restaurant openings.
•Free cash flow was $5.7 billion, a 36% increase over the prior year .
•Across the System, about 1,200 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and af filiated markets) were opened.
•One-year ROIIC was 22.8%  and three-year ROIIC was 40.6%  for the period ended December 31, 2019 . Excluding significant
investing cash flows resulting from the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives, three-year ROIIC was 24.6% (see reconciliation
in Exhibit 12).
•The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 8% to $1.25 for the fourth quarter , equivalent to an annual dividend
of $5.00 per share.
•The Company returned $8.6 billion  to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year , marking successful
achievement of the Company's targeted return of $25 billion for the three-year period ending 2019.
STRATEGIC DIRECTION
The strength of the alignment among the Company , its franchisees and suppliers is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging
the System, McDonald’ s is able to identify , implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's
continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-
relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.
CUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGY
The V elocity Growth Plan, the Company’ s customer-centric strategy , is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a
deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Plan is designed to drive sustainable comparable sales and guest count
growth, reliable long-term measures of the Company's strength that are vital to growing shareholder value. In 2019, execution of the Plan
drove further broad-based growth around the globe. In 2020, the Company will continue to focus on elevating the customer experience
through improved restaurant execution and creating excitement around our food and value of ferings, while continuing to leverage
technology to enable greater convenience and customer personalization.
The Company continues to target the opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is
built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonald’ s:
•Retaining existing customers  - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category , including family
occasions and food-led breakfast.
•Regaining customers who visit less often  - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality , convenience and
speed, experience and value.
•Converting casual to committed customers  - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and
leveraging the McCafé cof fee brand and enhancing snack and treat of ferings.
The Company continues to scale and optimize the Plan through the following growth accelerators:
•Experience of the Future . The Company is building upon its investments in EOTF , focusing on restaurant modernization in order to
transform the restaurant service experience and enhance our brand in the eyes of our customers. The modernization ef forts are
designed to provide a better customer experience, leading to increased frequency of customer visits and higher average check. As of
the end of 2019, EOTF is deployed in over half of the restaurants in our global system, with most of the major markets substantially
complete. In 2019, the U.S. converted about 2,000 restaurants to EOTF , resulting in about 70% of the U.S. restaurants now having
EOTF . In 2020, the Company will further deploy EOTF around the globe, including converting about 1,800 of the remaining
restaurants in the U.S. to EOTF .
•Digital . The Company is improving its existing service model with customers through technology . Digital technology is transforming the
retail industry , and the Company is using it to transform McDonald’ s for our customers at an accelerated pace. By evolving the
technology platform, the Company is expanding choices for how customers order , pay and are served their food. The added
functionality of the Company’ s global mobile app, self-order kiosks, and other technologies enable greater convenience for the
customer on their terms. In 2019, the Company built on its digital foundation, acquiring Dynamic Yield, a leader in personalization and
decision logic technology . The Company has implemented this technology via outdoor digital menu boards in over 11,000 U.S. drive-
thrus, of fering customers a more customized experience and producing sales growth through higher average check. This technology
is also deployed in nearly all drive-thrus in Australia, and we are looking to deploy across further international markets beginning in
2020. The Company continued to expand its technological capabilities via the acquisition of Apprente, an early-stage leader in
conversational interface technology . This technology is expected to provide more ef ficient and accurate ordering in the drive-thru. In
2020, the Company will continue to utilize more personalized digital initiatives to engage customers, grow awareness and adoption of
digital of ferings, and support our menu of ferings.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 7
•Delivery .  The Company continues to build momentum with its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience for its
customers. In 2019, McDonald’ s continued to add third-party delivery partners in order to maximize the System’ s delivery scale and
potential. Across the global system, nearly 25,000 restaurants now of fer delivery . Customers are responding positively , as
demonstrated by high satisfaction ratings, strong reorder rates, and average checks that are generally two times higher than average
non-delivery transactions. Further , in some of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants
offering delivery . Consequently , McDonald’ s global delivery business has grown to over $4 billion in Systemwide sales in 2019, up
from $1 billion in 2016. W e continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial of delivery , and are focusing on
efforts to encourage frequency and retention in 2020 and beyond.
The Plan is a global strategy that is tailored at a market level to allow for the best customer experience and most convenience for our
valued customers. While the Plan provides a consistent framework on how to retain, regain, and convert customers, the execution varies
across the globe. The U.S., for example, remains centered on returning to guest count growth by focusing on running better restaurant
operations, introducing new menu items and of fering compelling value. In addition, we will continue transforming the customer experience
through aggressive execution of the growth accelerators of EOTF , digital and delivery . In 2020, the markets around the world will continue
to make progress on the three pillars of the Plan and its growth accelerators, focusing on food, value and customer convenience.
Our Plan also includes the Company further embedding actions in response to certain social and environmental issues into the core of
our business. As one of the world’ s largest restaurant companies, our approach highlights our commitment to global actions that are
consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful
progress. W e recognize that our success in advancing these initiatives will be demonstrated as customers continue to feel good about
visiting McDonald’ s restaurants and eating our food.
While we are working to address many challenges facing society today , we are elevating global action where we believe we can make
the greatest dif ference in driving industry-wide change. Our priorities reflect the social and environmental impacts of our food and our
business. Highlights include science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions and climate action, advancing sustainable
practices in beef production with suppliers and producers, driving innovative solutions for our packaging and recycling ef forts, and ongoing
commitments to support families and provide opportunities for youth in our communities. In 2019, for example, we made progress toward
our 2030 climate action target with the addition of significant investments in renewable energy projects in the U.S.; we achieved our goal of
100% sustainably sourced McCafé cof fee for U.S. restaurants; and we continued to make a dif ference for families through innovation in
our food of ferings, reading programs and support for Ronald McDonald House Charities.
The Company is confident, that under the Plan, we will continue to improve the taste of our delicious food, enhance convenience and
service through running great restaurants, of fer compelling value, and heighten the trust consumers place in our brand, which we believe
will enable us to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 8
OUTLOOK
2020 Outlook
The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company’ s future results.
• Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion, and the potential impacts of hyper-
inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2020 Systemwide sales
growth (in constant currencies).
• The Company expects full year 2020 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase about 5% to 7% in constant currencies
as the Company invests in technology and research & development, and incurs costs related to the W orldwide Owner/Operator
Convention, which will occur in the second quarter 2020.
• Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2020 to
increase about 4% to 6% due primarily to higher average debt balances.
• A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in
foreign currencies. Accordingly , earnings are af fected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British
Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar . Collectively , these currencies represent approximately 80% of the Company's
operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted
earnings per share would change by about 35 cents.
• The Company expects the ef fective income tax rate for the full year 2020 to be in the 23% to 25% range. Some volatility may result
in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.
• The Company expects capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About $1.3 billion will be dedicated to our U.S.
business, over half of which is allocated to approximately 1,800 EOTF projects. Globally , we expect to open roughly 1,400
restaurants. W e will spend approximately $800 million in the U.S. and International Operated segments to open 400 restaurants and
our developmental licensees and af filiates will contribute capital towards the remaining 1,000 restaurant openings in the International
Developmental Licensed segment. The Company expects about 1,000 net restaurant additions in 2020.
Long-T erm Outlook
• Over the long-term, the Company expects to achieve the following average annual (constant currency) financial targets:
◦Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%;
◦Operating margin in the mid-40% range;
◦Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and
◦Return on incremental invested capital in the mid-20% range.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates af fect reported results, McDonald’ s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing
goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.
In 2019, results reflected the weakening of the Euro and most other major currencies. In 2018, results reflected the stronger Euro and
British Pound. In 2017, results reflected the stronger Euro, of fset by the weaker British Pound.

NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
In 2019 , net income increased  2% (4% in constant currencies) to $6.0 billion  and diluted earnings per common share increased  5% (7% in
constant currencies) to $7.88 . Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.21 on diluted earnings per share.
In 2018, net income increased 14% (13% in constant currencies) to $5.9 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased
18% (18% in constant currencies) to $7.54. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.04 on diluted earnings per share.
Results in 2019 reflected stronger operating performance primarily due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly
offset by lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses (mostly in the U.S.) and higher G&A  spend. Results in 2018 reflected a lower
effective tax rate, and stronger operating performance due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly of fset by lower
Company-operated margin dollars due to the impact of refranchising.

Included in the 2019 results were:
◦$84 million, or $0.11 per share, of income tax benefit due to new regulations issued in the fourth quarter 2019 related to the
Tax Act; and
◦$74 million of pre-tax strategic charges, or $0.07 per share, primarily related to impairment associated with the purchase of
our joint venture partner's interest in the India Delhi market, partly of fset by gains on the sales of property at the former
Corporate headquarters.
Included in the 2018 results were:
◦$75 million, or $0.10 per share, of net tax cost associated with the final 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts
recorded in December 2017 under the Tax Act;
◦$140 million of pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges, or $0.17 per share; and
◦$94 million of pre-tax strategic restructuring charges, or $0.09 per share.
Included in the 2017 results were:
◦$700 million of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, or $0.82 per share; and
◦a pre-tax gain of $850 million on the sale of the Company’ s businesses in China and Hong Kong, of fset in part by $150
million of restructuring and impairment charges in connection with the Company’ s global G&A  and refranchising initiatives, for
a net benefit of $0.53 per share.
Excluding the above 2019 and 2018 items, 2019 net income decreased 3% (1% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per
share decreased 1% (increased 2% in constant currencies). Excluding items impacting 2018 and 2017, 2018 net income increased 14%
(14% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share increased 19% (18% in constant currencies).
The Company repurchased 25.0 million  shares of its stock for $5.0 billion in 2019  and 32.2 million  shares of its stock for $5.2 billion  in
2018 , driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per
share.
REVENUES
The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by
conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and af filiates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and
royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental
licensees and af filiates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Initial fees are recognized evenly
over the franchise term.
Franchised restaurants represent 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2019. The Company's current mix of
Company-owned and franchised restaurants enables the Company to generate stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams.
Refranchising to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants may negatively impact consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales
are replaced by franchised revenues, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percent of sales.
In 2019, revenues were relatively flat with the prior year (increased 3% in constant currencies). The constant currency increase was
primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly of fset by the impact of refranchising. In 2018, revenues decreased 8% (8% in constant
currencies), reflecting the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives, partly of fset by positive comparable sales.

FRANCHISED MARGINS
Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the Company’ s costs associated with those restaurants,
primarily occupancy costs (rent and depreciation). Franchised margin dollars represented about 85% of the combined restaurant margins
in 2019  and 2018 , and about 80% in 2017.
In 2019 , franchised margin dollars increased  $416 million  or 5% (7% in constant currencies). In 2018 , franchised margin dollars
increased $727 million  or 9% (8% in constant currencies). For both 2019 and 2018, the increases were due to positive comparable sales
performance across all segments, as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising.

The adoption of Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, "Leases" ("ASC 842") had no impact on franchised margin dollars,
but had a negative impact on the Company's franchised margin percent for 2019 of approximately 1.3% in the U.S. and 0.7% on a
consolidated basis. ASC 842 clarified the presentation of sub-lease income and lease expense, requiring the straight-line impact of fixed
rent escalations to be presented on a gross basis in lease income and lease expense.
•U.S.:  In 2019  and 2018 , the decreases in the franchised margin percents were primarily due to higher depreciation costs related to
investments in EOTF , partly of fset by the benefit from positive comparable sales. 2019 also reflected the impact of the new lease
standard.
•International Operated Markets:  In 2019  and 2018 , the increases in the franchised margin percent primarily reflected the benefit
from strong comparable sales.

2019 , Company-operated margin dollars decreased  $87 million or 5% (2% in constant currencies). In 2018 , Company-operated margin
dollars decreased $562 million  or 24% (25% in constant currencies) primarily reflecting the Company's sale of its businesses in China and

•U.S.:  In 2019 , the increase in the Company-operated margin percent primarily reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales,
partly of fset by higher commodity costs, wages and depreciation expense associated with EOTF deployment. In 2018 , the Company-
operated margin percent decreased, reflecting the impact of accelerated deployment of EOTF (including the related decrease in labor
productivity and higher depreciation expense), and higher wages and commodity costs, which more than of fset the benefit from
positive comparable sales and refranchising.

In 2019, gains on sales of restaurant businesses decreased primarily due to fewer restaurant sales in the U.S.
•Impairment and other charges (gains), net
In 2019, impairment and other charges (gains), net primarily reflected $99.4 million of impairment associated with the purchase of our joint
venture partner's interest in the India Delhi market. Impairment was recorded to reflect the write-down of net assets to fair value in
accordance with accounting rules. This was partly of fset by $20.3 million of gains on the sales of property at the former Corporate
headquarters which were impaired in 2015 based on estimated fair values.
The results in 2018 reflected $140 million of impairment charges due to the Company’ s assessment of the recoverability of long-lived
assets as well as the strategic restructuring charge in the U.S. of $85.0 million.
The results in 2017 reflected a gain on the Company's sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong of $850 million, partly of fset by
$150 million of restructuring and impairment charges.

Company-operated margin dollars.
•International Operated Markets:  In 2019 and 2018, the constant currency operating income increase was primarily due to
sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars. 2018 results also reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant
businesses in the U.K. and Australia compared to 2017.
•Operating margin: Operating margin was 43.0%  in 2019 , 42.0%  in 2018  and 41.9%  in 2017 . Excluding the impact of the current and

The ef fective income tax rate for 2018 reflected the final 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the Tax
Act of $75 million net tax cost. Excluding the 2018 impact of the Tax Act and impairment charges, the ef fective income tax rate was 22.9%
for the year 2018.
Excluding these current year and prior year items, the lower ef fective income tax rate for 2018 primarily reflected a benefit from a
change in tax reserves as a result of global audit progression, as well as lower tax costs in 2018 related to ongoing taxes under the Tax
Act.
Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $5.3 billion  in 2019  and $2.0 billion  in 2018 .
Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently issued accounting standards are included on page 39 of this Form 10-K.
CASH FLOWS
The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and
discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
Cash provided by operations totaled $8.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.1 billion or 17%. Free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019,
an increase of $1.5 billion or 36%. The Company’ s free cash flow conversion rate was 95% in 2019 and 71% in 2018 (see reconciliation in
Exhibit 12). Cash provided by operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and
lower income tax payments. In 2018, cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion or 25% compared with
2017, primarily due to lower tax payments.
Cash used for investing activities totaled $3.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $616 million compared with 2018. The increase was
primarily due to the Company’ s strategic acquisitions of a real estate entity , Dynamic Yield and Apprente, partly of fset by lower capital
expenditures. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $3.0 billion compared with 2017. The increase
was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of restaurant businesses in 2018 including the comparison to the proceeds received in
2017 associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as higher capital expenditures.
Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of $955 million compared with 2018, primarily due to net debt
activity . Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $639 million compared with 2017, primarily due to
higher treasury stock purchases.
The Company’ s cash and equivalents balance was $899 million and $866 million at year end 2019 and 2018, respectively . In addition
to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued
access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
In 2019 , the Company opened 1,231  restaurants and closed 391 restaurants. In 2018, the Company opened 1,081 restaurants and closed
467 restaurants.
Systemwide restaurants at year end

Approximately 93% of the restaurants at year-end 2019  were franchised, including 95% in the U.S., 84% in International Operated
Markets and 98% in the International Developmental Licensed Markets.
Capital expenditures decreased $348 million or 13% in 2019 primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly of fset
by an increase in new restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Capital expenditures increased $888 million or 48% in
2018, primarily due to reinvestment in existing restaurants (including investment in EOTF).

(1) Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures
New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth.
Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs
within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized
restaurants, construction and design ef ficiencies, as well as leveraging the Company's global sourcing network and best practices.
Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs for new traditional McDonald’ s
restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $4.0 million  in 2019 .
The Company owned approximately 55% and 50% of the land for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2019  and 2018,
respectively , and approximately 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2019  and 2018.
SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS
In 2019, the Company returned approximately $8.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends
paid, marking the achievement of the Company's targeted return of $25 billion for the three-year period ended 2019.

Total returned to shareholders $8,562  $8,503 $7,740
In July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding stock, with
no specified expiration date. In 2019, approximately 25.0 million shares were repurchased for $5.0 billion, bringing total purchases under
the program to approximately 74.5 million shares or $12.9 billion. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the
2017 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, ef fective January 1, 2020, that authorized the purchase of up to $15
billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date.
The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 44 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year .
The 2019 full year dividend of $4.73  per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $1.16 per share,
with an increase to $1.25 per share paid in the fourth quarter . This 8% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $5.00 per share
annual dividend and reflects the Company’ s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow . As in the past, future
dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of
the Company’ s Board of Directors.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
TOTAL ASSETS
Total assets increased $14.7 billion  or 45% in 2019 , primarily due to the addition of the Lease Right-of-Use Asset, Net, which was recorded
upon adoption of ASC 842 ef fective January 1, 2019. Refer to the Lease Accounting section under Recent Accounting Pronouncements on
page 39  for additional information on ASC 842. Net property and equipment increased $1.3 billion  in 2019, primarily due to capital
expenditures, partly of fset by depreciation. Net property and equipment and the Lease Right-of-Use Asset, Net represented over 50% and
approximately 30%, respectively , of total assets at year-end. Approximately 93% of total assets were in the U.S. and International
Operated Markets at year-end 2019.
FINANCING AND MARKET RISK
The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency
fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2019  totaled $34.2 billion, compared with $31.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The net
increase in 2019  was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.5 billion.

Standard & Poor ’s and Moody’ s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company’ s commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively; and
its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively . To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to
assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.
Certain of the Company’ s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary
mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’ s debt obligations that would accelerate
repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’ s business. In October 2016, the
Company's Board of Directors authorized the borrowing of up to $15.0 billion of funds, of which $1.9 billion remained outstanding as of
December 31, 2019. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2016 borrowing authority and authorized a new
$15 billion of borrowing capacity with no specified expiration date. These borrowings may include (i) public or private of fering of debt
securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities
available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-T erm Notes program, the Company has
$3.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global
markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). In 2020, the Company plans to issue long-term debt to
refinance $2.4 billion of maturing corporate debt. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's subsidiaries also had $242 million of
borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.
The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company
manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and
repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All
swaps are over-the-counter instruments.
In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and
finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign
currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and af filiates.
This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’  equity . Total foreign currency-denominated debt
was $12.9 billion and $11.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019  and 2018, respectively . In addition, where practical, the
Company’ s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant
accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional
information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting
arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below , or aggregate exposures
exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2019 , the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to
negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative
position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’ s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to
post collateral on their liability positions.
The Company’ s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’ s largest net asset exposures
(defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:
Foreign currency net asset exposures
In millions of U.S. Dollars 2019 2018
British Pounds Sterling $811 $1,840

Polish Zloty 396 340
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 18
The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’ s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial
instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but
did not consider the ef fects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate
analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial
instruments; however , the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the ef fect of fluctuating
currencies on the Company’ s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of
these analyses of the Company’ s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2019  levels
nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2019  levels would materially af fect the Company’ s results of operations, cash
flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
LIQUIDITY
The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn approximately 65% of our operating income. A significant portion
of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make,
substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations.
The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $425 million as of December 31, 2019 .
Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, issuance of
domestic debt, and repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings to continue to be suf ficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and
financing activities. W e also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be
sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing and financing activities.
In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is
available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign
jurisdictions.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and
franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its
franchise arrangements. Minimum rent under franchise arrangements are based on the Company’ s underlying investment in owned sites
and parallel the Company’ s underlying lease obligations and escalations on properties that are leased. The Company believes that control
over the real estate enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are amongst the highest in the industry . Cash provided by
operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’ s borrowing capacity and other sources of
cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’ s contractual obligations and their aggregate
maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31,
2019 .

future minimum payments exclude option periods that have not yet been exercised.
(2) The maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $3.5 billion , as they are supported by a long-term line of credit
agreement expiring in December 2023. Debt obligations do not include the impact of non-cash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs and accrued
interest.
In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions
and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") limitations. At December 31, 2019 , total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $435 million .
At December 31, 2019, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.4 billion .
There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to
construction, inventory , energy , marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business.  Such
commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the Company’ s
overall financial position.
The Company also has guaranteed certain other loans totaling approximately $75 million at December 31, 2019. These guarantees
are contingent commitments generally issued by the Company to support borrowing arrangements of the System. At December 31, 2019,
there was no carrying value for obligations under these guarantees in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 19
OTHER MATTERS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’ s consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation
of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that af fect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and
judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may dif fer from these estimates.
The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide
accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its
significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
•Property and equipment
Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’ s estimates of
the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are
estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company
periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use
of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may
need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-of fs in future periods.
•Leasing Arrangements
The Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and
generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Right of Use Asset and
Lease Liability reflect the present value of the Company’ s estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes
options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate.
Typically , renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building or
leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the sales performance of the restaurant remains strong. Therefore, the
Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company .
As the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease
liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a
lease within a particular currency environment.
•Share-based compensation
The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock
options and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is
based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when
determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model
requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate,
expected volatility of the Company’ s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to
determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will
fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’ s stock at date of grant, and prior
to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, the
Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the
performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation
model.
•Long-lived assets impairment review
Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’ s
long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows
and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’ s experience and knowledge of
its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and
economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting
estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’ s estimates or underlying assumptions change in
the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the
fourth quarter , the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual market) with risk of material goodwill
impairment.
•Litigation accruals
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors,
customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property , shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to
assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A
determination of the amount of accrual required, if any , for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter . The required
accrual may change in the future due to new developments in a particular matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement
strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material
adverse ef fect on its financial condition or results of operations.
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 20
•Income taxes
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and
assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an
increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals
for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter . The most
significant new developments in 2019 and 2018 are described below .
In 2019 and 2018, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by $96 million and $162 million, respectively . In
both 2019 and 2018, there was audit progression in the U.S. federal and state audits, as well as multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. The
Company has considered this new information in evaluating the unrecognized tax benefits and in certain situations, the Company changed
its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits. These changes have been reflected in the Unrecognized Tax
Benefits table that is included in the Income Taxes footnote on page 50.
In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing
adjustments related to the Company’ s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with
the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December
2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and during 2019, the Company and the IRS Appeals team continued to have a
dialogue regarding these disagreed transfer pricing matters. As of December 31, 2019, the Company does not yet have a signed closing
agreement with the IRS related to the settlement of these issues. The Company expects resolution on these issues in 2020.
In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’ s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS
issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR.
Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for
2011 and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process,
such that resolution is expected in 2020.
While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded
are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the ASC.
The Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%
from 35% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax
deferred. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date ef fects of the Tax Act by applying the guidance in
Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118. In 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its
accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax ef fects of the Tax Act.
SAB 118 measurement period
At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax ef fects of the Tax Act
under ASC 740, Income T axes , primarily for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition
tax, and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings.
One-time transition tax: The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits ("E&P"), the tax on
which it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law . The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time
transition tax liability for each of its foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a transition tax liability of approximately $1.2 billion at December 31,
2017.
Upon further analysis of the Tax Act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury , the Company finalized its calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018 and increased its December 31, 2017 provisional
amount by approximately $75 million. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities: As of December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities
based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), by recording a provisional amount of
approximately $500 million. No adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018.
EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATION
The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases ef fectively . This ability is because of rapid inventory
turnover , the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly
financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

(3) While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company , management believes they are important in understanding the Company's financial
performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of
the franchisee base. Franchised restaurants represent 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2019.

STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH
At least annually , we consider which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group. McDonald's is included in published
restaurant indices; however , unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations,
McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of our revenues and income is generated outside the U.S.
In addition, because of our size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, we believe that such a
comparison is not meaningful.
Our market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's
inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA  companies generate meaningful revenues
and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, we believe that the use of the DJIA  companies as the group for
comparison purposes is appropriate.
The following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of
dividends) relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index (S&P  500 Index) and to the DJIA  companies for the five-year period ended
December 31, 2019 . The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the S&P  500 Index and the DJIA
companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2014 . For the DJIA  companies, returns are weighted for market
capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index,
which is not weighted by market capitalization, and may be composed of dif ferent companies during the period under consideration.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES
OF EQUITY SECURITIES
MARKET INFORMATION AND DIVIDEND POLICY
The Company’ s common stock trades under the symbol MCD and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S.
The number of shareholders of record and beneficial owners of the Company’ s common stock as of January 31, 2020  was estimated
to be 2,500,000 .
Given the Company’ s returns on incremental invested capital and significant cash provided by operations, management believes it is
prudent to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 44 consecutive years through 2019  and has increased the
dividend amount at least once every year . As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability
expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’ s Board of Directors.

RISK FACTORS
If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including under the V elocity Growth Plan, we may
not be able to increase operating income.
To drive operating income growth, our business strategies must be ef fective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal,
delivering sustainable guest count growth and driving a higher average check. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on
our System’ s ability to:
•Continue to innovate and dif ferentiate the McDonald’ s experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that
balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;
•Capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to enhance our ability to retain, regain and convert key
customer groups;
•Utilize our organizational structure to build on our progress and execute against our business strategies;
•Integrate and augment our technology and digital initiatives, including mobile ordering and delivery;
•Identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants;
•Operate restaurants with high service levels and optimal capacity while managing the increasing complexity of our restaurant
operations, create ef ficiencies through innovative use of technology and complete Experience of the Future (“EOTF”), particularly in
the U.S.; and
•Accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities, acquisitions, investments and partnerships.
If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may suf fer.
Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology , may not generate the expected returns.
Our long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. W e continue to build upon our
investments in technology and modernization, including in EOTF (which focuses on restaurant modernization), digital engagement and
delivery , in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our
service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, as well as mobile
ordering and payment systems. W e also continue to refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial, and to
enhance our drive-thru technologies, which may not generate expected returns. If these initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not
fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suf fer.
If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and
marketing plans, our business could suffer .
Our continued success depends on our System’ s ability to retain, regain and convert customers. In order to do so, we need to
anticipate and respond ef fectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food
offerings and consumer preferences in the “informal eating out” (“IEO”) segment. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and ef fectively
respond to, these changes, or our competitors predict or respond more ef fectively , our financial results could be adversely impacted.
Our ability to retain, regain and convert customers also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across
the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and ef fectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting
economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to
continue to be important components of our business strategy; however , they may not be successful in retaining, regaining and converting
customers, or may not be as successful as the ef forts of our competitors, and could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market
share.
Additionally , we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be
successful in retaining, regaining and converting customers. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and
marketing resources across dif ferent channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers ef fectively and ef ficiently . If
the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts
and market share could decrease.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 25
Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in
part on consumer perceptions. Those perceptions are af fected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of
our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and our general business practices. Consumer acceptance
of our of ferings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly . For example, nutritional, health,
environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular
opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that af fect the IEO segment or
perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Consumer perceptions may also be af fected by adverse
commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the
IEO segment, our brand, our operations, our suppliers, or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or
perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and our financial results may suf fer.
Additionally , the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require
Systemwide coordination and alignment. W e are working to manage any risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of any
effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public
focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as
packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include any increased pressure to make
commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational
and execution costs or risks.
If we are not ef fective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals,
consumer trust in our brand may suf fer. In particular , business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, that erode consumer
trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce
brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.
We compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. W e also face sustained, intense competition from traditional,
fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores
and cof fee shops. W e expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may
be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions or product of ferings of our competitors, which may have a
short- or long-term impact on our results.
We compete on the basis of product choice, quality , affordability , service and location. In particular , we believe our ability to compete
successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce
new products, price our products appropriately , deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant
operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond ef fectively to our competitors’  actions or of ferings or to
unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be ef fective, and some strategies may be ef fective at
improving some metrics while adversely af fecting other metrics, which could have the overall ef fect of harming our business.
Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our results of operations are substantially af fected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact
consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including
hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through
austerity , stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability , inflation,
taxation and other economic drivers. Sustained adverse economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions in our
markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suf fer.
Our results of operations are also af fected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and unfavorable currency fluctuations could
adversely af fect reported earnings.
Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.
We depend on the ef fectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and suf ficient supply of quality products on
favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain
products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions, including shortages and
transportation issues, and price increases can adversely af fect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have
a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers,
franchisees or us. If we experience interruptions in our System’ s supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of
products critical to our System’ s operations.
Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System’ s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to
manage the potential impact on McDonald’ s of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future,
including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery . Food safety is a top priority , and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our
customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However , food safety events, including instances of
food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time and could occur in the future. Instances of food
tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely af fect our brand and reputation as well
as our revenues and profits.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 26
Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.
The Company's success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our
franchisees, including our developmental licensees and af filiates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised
restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants.
Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently , and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day
operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees
to grow their sales. Business risks af fecting our operations also af fect our franchisees. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth,
our revenues and margins could be negatively af fected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may
deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures, or delayed or reduced payments to us.
Our success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and af filiates to implement major initiatives,
which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment
plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of
funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by the creditworthiness of our
franchisees or the Company or by banks’  lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are
unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
Our operating performance could also be negatively af fected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems
or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly
to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent
with our required standards, our brand’ s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating
results.
Our ownership mix also af fects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or
license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure
depend on various factors including whether we have ef fectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or af filiates that meet our rigorous
standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting
ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.
Challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business.
Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. The Board named Christopher Kempczinski as President and
Chief Executive Of ficer and named Joseph Erlinger as President, McDonald's USA, ef fective as of November 1, 2019. In addition, on
December 6, 2019, the Board named Ian Borden as President, International, ef fective that same day . Failure to ef fectively identify , develop
and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions, including the recent
leadership transitions, could disrupt our business and adversely af fect our results.
Challenges with respect to labor , including availability and cost, could impact our business and results of operations.
Our success depends in part on our System’ s ability to proactively recruit, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in
McDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staf fed restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. In many of our markets,
unemployment is low and demand is high for labor . Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified
employees to work in our Company-operated restaurants, as well as costs to promote awareness of the opportunities of working at
McDonald's restaurants, could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins. Similar concerns apply to our franchisees.
We are also impacted by the costs and other ef fects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations af fecting our workforce,
which includes our staf f and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on
employment issues, including wage and hour , healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices.
Claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Our potential exposure to reputational and
other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving
rise to claims of sexual harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us
and our business. Additionally , economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could
adversely af fect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonald's
System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.
Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security , may impact our operations or cause
reputational harm.
We are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, technologies supporting McDonald’ s digital and delivery
solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with af filiated entities, customers, employees, franchisees,
suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or
provided by third parties. Any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our franchisees’  operations, or our
customers’  experience and perceptions. Additionally , we provide certain technology systems to businesses that are unaf filiated with the
McDonald’ s System and a failure, interruption or breach of these systems may cause harm to those unaf filiated parties, which may result
in liability to the Company or reputational harm.
Despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or
failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also
become vulnerable, unreliable or inef ficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and maintenance. Our
increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party’ s business, including the operational, security and
credit risks of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner ,
we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees’  operations.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 27
Furthermore, security incidents or breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the
systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees), or those of third party providers. These may include
such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or
ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Our technology systems contain personal, financial and other information
that is entrusted to us by our customers, our employees, our franchisees, our business customers and other third parties, as well as
financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. An actual or alleged security breach could result in
disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal, financial, proprietary or other confidential information. The occurrence
of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage, adverse publicity , loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits,
complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities.
If we fail to comply with privacy and data collection laws, we could be subject to penalties, which could negatively affect our
financial results or brand perceptions.
We are subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability related to privacy and data collection, protection and
management, as it relates to information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to business
partners, customers, employees, franchisees or other third parties. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
requires entities processing the personal data of individuals in the European Union to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of
that data. W e are also subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area. These regulations have been subject
to frequent change, and there may be markets or jurisdictions that propose or enact new or emerging data privacy requirements in the
future. Failure to meet GDPR or other data privacy requirements could result in substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our
financial results or brand perceptions.
The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
We encounter dif fering cultural, regulatory , geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries
where McDonald’ s restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these
environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global
success is partially dependent on our System’ s ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned
initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer
perceptions and guest counts.
Disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or
changes in trade-related tarif fs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our , our franchisees’  or our
suppliers’  operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tarif fs and other regulations af fecting trade between the U.S. and other countries
could adversely af fect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause
reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the ef fectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to
reduce our exposure to such governmental actions.
Additionally , challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher
risk of political instability , economic volatility , crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. Such challenges may be exacerbated in many
cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas
most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage ef fectively the risks associated with our
international operations could have a material adverse ef fect on our business and financial condition.
We may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, as a result of the U.K.’ s decision to leave the
European Union, whether through a negotiated exit over a period of time or without any agreement in place to govern post-exit relations, it
is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, particularly in the event that the U.K. leaves the European Union without
any agreement in place, as well as potential additional referenda in the U.K. and/or other European countries, that could cause uncertainty
in European or worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may
not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these ef fects, and
others we cannot anticipate, could adversely af fect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
If we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.
We have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. W e generally own or secure a long-
term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites. W e seek to identify and develop
restaurant locations that of fer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real
estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape
continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital and
delivery , local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not
evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely af fect Systemwide sales and profitability .
Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors,
including governmental regulations; insurance; zoning, tax and eminent domain laws; interest rate levels and the cost of financing. A
significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely af fect our operating
results.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 28
Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability .
We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are af fected by
tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular , we are af fected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related
authoritative interpretations. W e are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and
governmental authorities inside and outside of the U.S. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature
and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a
material adverse impact on our financial results.
Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
The profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity
costs, including food, paper , supplies, fuel, utilities and distribution, and other operating costs, including labor . Any volatility in certain
commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely af fect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability . The
commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal
shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government
regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. W e can only partially address future price risk
through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability .
Increasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could af fect our
operations and results in material ways. Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations
involving, among other matters, product packaging, marketing, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other
products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance ef forts with those regulations may be af fected by ordinary variations in food
preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers.
Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of regulations that can af fect our business plans and operations, and
have increased our costs of doing business and exposure to litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.
We are also subject to legal proceedings that may adversely af fect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings,
government investigations and proceedings, shareholder proceedings, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes,
supplier related disputes, and claims by current or former franchisees. Regardless of whether claims against us are valid or whether we
are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management's attention away from operations.
Litigation and regulatory action concerning our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us
for employment law purposes, if determined adversely , could increase costs, negatively impact our business operations and the business
prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly , although our commercial relationships with
our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely , could also
increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.
Our results could also be af fected by the following:
•The relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number , nature and procedural status of
pending proceedings;
•The cost and other ef fects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other
actions that may af fect perceptions of our brand and products; and
•Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the
appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices.
A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely af fect our
financial condition or results of operations. Further , adverse publicity resulting from claims may hurt our business. If we are unable to
effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory and legal environment, it could have a material adverse ef fect on our
business and financial condition.
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual
property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald’ s brand and our business.
The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase
brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. W e rely on a combination of
trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded
products.
We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may
do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our
intellectual property , and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be
adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and
third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular , we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often
aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might af fect our operations and
results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.
We cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt
the value of our intellectual property .
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 29
Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations
and results.
New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect
to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely af fect our future results. W e may also be af fected by the nature and timing of
decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our
earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions
regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many
factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic
trends, and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record
impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse ef fect on our reported results for the
affected periods.
A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability .
Our credit ratings may be negatively af fected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest
expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our
operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively af fected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants.
Our operations may also be impacted by regulations af fecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit
our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur , they could have a
material adverse ef fect on our business and financial condition.
Trading volatility and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.
Many factors af fect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most
important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
•The unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions;
•Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial
markets, particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary
about economic, trade or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;
•Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt
securities, which can be af fected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized
disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness;
investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence
our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the
ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald’ s may be included, such as the S&P  500 Index and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average;
•The impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and
•The impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as
those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies, including through acquisitions, in light of changing business,
legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure.
Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect
our results and prospects.
Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, any shifting climate patterns, terrorist activities, health
epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely af fect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply
availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can af fect our results and prospects. For example,
the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China has disrupted local operations, and neither the duration nor scope of the disruption can be
predicted. Therefore, while we expect this matter to negatively impact our results, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably
estimated at this time. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the
proceeds may be insuf ficient to cover our losses fully .
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 30
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of
allegations spanning the Company’ s entire business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of claims and
lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business,
as discussed below . While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse ef fect
on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur . Were an unfavorable ruling to occur , there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on net income for the period in which the ruling occurs or for future periods.
▪Franchising
A substantial number of McDonald’ s restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators and developmental licensees under
contractual arrangements with the Company . In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company
and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality , service and cleanliness
issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, delinquent payments of rents and fees, and franchisee
claims for additional franchises or renewals of franchises. Additionally , occasional disputes arise between the Company and individuals
who claim they should have been granted a McDonald’ s franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its
franchisees for employment law purposes.
▪Suppliers
The Company and its af filiates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald’ s restaurants. The
Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company’ s
high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its suppliers (or former suppliers) which include,
for example, compliance with product specifications and the Company’ s business relationship with suppliers. In addition, disputes
occasionally arise on a number of issues between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have
been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Company’ s restaurants.
▪Employees
Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company .
In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise
regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with
labor and employment laws.
▪Customers
Restaurants owned by subsidiaries of the Company regularly serve a broad segment of the public as do independent owner/operators and
developmental licensees of McDonald's restaurants. In so doing, disputes arise as to products, service, incidents, pricing, advertising,
nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company .
▪Intellectual Property
The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the
Company’ s business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend
against the alleged use of third party intellectual property . 
▪Government Regulations
Local and national governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not
limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety , environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation. The Company is
occasionally involved in litigation or other proceedings regarding these matters. The Company strives to comply with all applicable existing
statutory and administrative rules and cannot predict the ef fect on its operations from these matters or the issuance of additional
requirements in the future.
PROPERTIES
The Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites
that of fer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the System. To assess potential, the Company analyzes
traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Company’ s experience and access to advanced technology aid in
evaluating this information. The Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional
franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which facilitates long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs.
Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing ef forts are made to control average
development costs through construction and design ef ficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Company’ s global sourcing
network.
In addition, the Company primarily leases real estate in connection with its corporate headquarters, field and other of fices.
Additional information about the Company’ s properties is included in Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations on pages 6 through 21  and in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data on pages 33 through 58 of this
Form 10-K.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company franchises and operates McDonald’ s restaurants in the global restaurant industry . All restaurants are operated either by the
Company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchised arrangements, and developmental licensees or af filiates
under license agreements.
The following table presents restaurant information by ownership type:
Restaurants at December 31, 2019 2018  2017
Conventional franchised 21,837 21,685  21,366
Developmental licensed 7,648 7,225  6,945
Foreign af filiated 6,574 6,175  5,797
    Total Franchised 36,059 35,085  34,108
    Company-operated 2,636 2,770  3,133
        T otal Systemwide restaurants 38,695 37,855  37,241
The results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either
individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in af filiates owned 50% or
less (primarily McDonald’ s China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners,
developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally , these businesses
qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of
any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.
ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that af fect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could dif fer from those estimates.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Generally , the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency .
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Lease Accounting
The Company adopted ASC Topic 842, "Leases" ("ASC 842") as of January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method. As
discussed further in the “Franchise Arrangements” and “Leasing Arrangements” footnotes, the Company is engaged in a significant
amount of leasing activity , both from a lessor and a lessee perspective.
The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows the Company to retain the classification of existing
leases; therefore, there was minimal initial impact in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and no cumulative adjustment to retained
earnings was recognized upon adoption. As the Company enters into new ground leases or as existing ground leases are modified, many
of these may be reclassified from operating classification to financing classification, which will change the timing and classification of a
portion of lease expense between Operating income and Interest expense. It is not possible to quantify the impact at this time, due to the
unknown timing of new leases and lease modifications, however the Company does not expect the impact to be material to any given year .
The Company has also made an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less of f of the balance
sheet. These types of leases primarily relate to leases of of fice equipment, and are not significant in comparison to the Company’ s overall
lease portfolio. Payments related to those leases will continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
The Company has certain leases subject to index adjustments. Historically , the Company has calculated and disclosed future
minimum payments for these leases using the index as of the end of the reporting period. As part of the transition, the Company used the
index in ef fect at transition for adoption of ASC 842 in its disclosure of future minimum lease payments and its calculation of the lease
liability . For leases entered into after January 1, 2019, the index at lease inception date will be used to calculate the lease liability until
lease modification.
The Company recorded a Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of $12.5 billion upon
adoption. The Lease Liability reflects the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term,
which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate. The
impact of the new lease guidance is non-cash in nature, therefore, it does not af fect the Company’ s cash flows.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 39
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
In June 2016, the F ASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (T opic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments", that modifies the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses on financial assets. The Company will
adopt this guidance ef fective January 1, 2020, prospectively . The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company's consolidated financial statements.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees,
developmental licensees and af filiates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent
of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and af filiates
include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of
sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales
occur . Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term, and variable rent
payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur . The Company's accounting policy
through December 31, 2017, was to recognize initial franchise fees when received, upon a new restaurant opening and at the start of a
new franchise term. Beginning in January 2018, initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the
franchise term, which is generally 20 years.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives: buildings–up to 40 years; leasehold improvements– the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms , which
generally include certain option periods; and equipment– 3 to 12 years.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
Capitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which
primarily ranges from 2 to 7 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back of fice and
Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous
Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2019 -$665.4 ; 2018 -$609.7 ; 2017 -$535.6 .
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald’ s restaurant assets for
potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field of fice level, and internationally , at a market level. The
Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual
restaurant’ s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any
grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is
compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying
amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.
Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and
committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12
months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally , such losses are
related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered “available for
sale."
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other
businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership
increases in subsidiaries or af filiates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill
associated with the acquisition is written of f in its entirety . If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of
goodwill written of f is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.
The following table presents the 2019 activity in goodwill by segment:
In millions U.S.International
Operated MarketsInternational Developmental
Licensed Markets &

Balance at December 31, 2019 $1,615.8 $1,061.6 $ — $2,677.4
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 40
The Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever an indicator of impairment exists. If
an indicator of impairment exists (e.g., estimated earnings multiple value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value), the goodwill
impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount
including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the dif ference
between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Historically , goodwill impairment has not
significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects accumulated impairment
losses of $113.9  million  and $15.6 million  as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively .
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs included in operating expenses of Company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising
cooperatives and were (in millions): 2019 –$365.8 ; 2018 –$388.8 ; 2017 –$532.9 . Production costs for radio and television advertising are
expensed when the commercials are initially aired. These production costs, primarily in the U.S., as well as other marketing-related
expenses are included in Selling, general & administrative expenses and were (in millions): 2019 –$81.5; 2018 –$88.0; 2017 –$100.2 . Costs
related to the Olympics sponsorship are included in the expenses for 2018. In addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by
franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets. The costs incurred by these advertising cooperatives
are approved and managed jointly by vote of both Company-operated restaurants and franchisees.
INCOME TAXES
Income T ax Uncertainties
The Company , like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments
may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly , tax liabilities are recorded when, in management’ s judgment, a tax
position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a
tax liability may still be recorded depending on management’ s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled.
The Company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
Accounting for Global Intangible Low-T axed Income ("GIL TI")
The Tax Act requires a U.S. shareholder of a foreign corporation to include GIL TI in taxable income. The accounting policy of the Company
is to record any tax on GIL TI in the provision for income taxes in the year it is incurred.  
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 41
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and
liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value
disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy , maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable
inputs.
The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. The
three levels are defined as follows:
▪Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market.
▪Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived
valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability .
▪Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability .
Certain of the Company’ s derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate
observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates, classified as Level 2 within the
valuation hierarchy . Derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the
counterparty or the Company . 
▪Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair V alue
The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as
defined in the fair value guidance:

(1) Level 1 is comprised of derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the Company’ s supplemental benefit plans.
▪Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair V alue on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair
value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment).
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded fair value adjustments to its long-lived assets, primarily to goodwill, based
on Level 3 inputs which includes the use of a discounted cash flow valuation approach.
▪Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair V alue
At December 31, 2019, the fair value of the Company’ s debt obligations was estimated at $37.6 billion , compared to a carrying amount of
$34.2 billion . The fair value was based on quoted market prices, Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy . The carrying amount for both cash
equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the ef fect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The
Company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. The Company does
not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Company’ s derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of
interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, and cross-currency interest rate swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or
net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the "Fair V alue," "Cash Flow" and "Net Investment" hedge sections.
The Company also enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity
derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In
addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities. Further details are explained in the “Undesignated Derivatives” section.
All derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value
and classified based on the instruments’  maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are
reflected as adjustments to AOCI and/or current earnings.

Fair V alue Hedges
The Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in fair values of certain liabilities. The Company enters into
fair value hedges that convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt by use of interest rate swaps.  At December 31, 2019 ,
the carrying amount of fixed-rate debt that was ef fectively converted was an equivalent notional amount of $998.5  million , which included
an increase of $ 12.1 million  of cumulative hedging adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recognized a $24.0
million  gain on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding loss on the fair value of the related hedged debt instrument to
interest expense.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. To protect against
the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses
foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. The hedges cover the next 18 months for certain exposures and
are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional
amount of $ 754.7  million  that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows.
Based on market conditions at December 31, 2019 , the $ 12.0 million  in cumulative cash flow hedging gains, after tax, is not expected
to have a significant ef fect on earnings over the next 12 months.
 
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 43
Net Investment Hedges
The Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries and af filiates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the
foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income ("OCI") and of fset translation adjustments on the underlying net
assets of foreign subsidiaries and af filiates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2019 , $11.9 billion  of the Company's
third party foreign currency denominated debt and $ 642.6  million  of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt were designated to
hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and af filiates.
Undesignated Derivatives
The Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting, therefore the changes in the fair value of these
derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example,
the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its
supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in selling, general & administrative
expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards
to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these
derivatives are recognized in nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet
position.
Credit Risk
The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not
have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2019  and has master agreements that contain netting
arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and
supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to
post collateral if credit ratings fall below , or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2019 , the Company
was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's
counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Company’ s supplemental
benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Share-based compensation includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value.
Share-based compensation expense and the ef fect on diluted earnings per common share were as follows:
In millions, except per share data 2019 2018  2017
Share-based compensation expense $ 109.6 $ 125.1  $ 117.5
After tax $ 94.2 $ 108.1  $ 82.0
Earnings per common share-diluted $ 0.12 $ 0.14  $ 0.10
Compensation expense related to share-based awards is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in
Selling, general & administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2019, there was $107.5  million  of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The following table
presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2019 , 2018  and 2017  stock option grants. The
expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends.
Expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the Company’ s stock for a period approximating the expected
life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’ s most recent annual dividend rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in ef fect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.
Weighted-average assumptions
 2019 2018 2017
Expected dividend yield 2.7% 2.6% 3.1%
Expected stock price volatility 18.9% 18.7% 18.4%

Expected life of options (in years) 5.8 5.8 5.9
Fair value per option granted $ 25.60 $ 23.80 $ 16.10
The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’ s stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a
reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a
relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-
based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

PER COMMON SHARE INFORMA TION
Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average
shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive ef fect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury
stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2019 –6.8; 2018 –7.3; 2017 –8.1. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in
diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2019 –0.1; 2018 –0.5; 2017 –0.1.
CASH AND EQUIV ALENTS
The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

Franchise Arrangements
Conventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing
rent and royalties to the Company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments. Minimum rent payments are based on the
Company's underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the Company’ s underlying leases and escalations on properties that are
leased. Under the franchise arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonald’ s System and, in
most cases, the use of a restaurant facility , generally for a period of 20 years. At the end of the 20-year franchise arrangement, the
Company maintains control of the underlying real estate and building and can either enter into a new 20-year franchise arrangement with
the existing franchisee or a dif ferent franchisee, or close the restaurant. Franchisees generally pay related occupancy costs including
property taxes, insurance and site maintenance.
Developmental licensees and af filiates operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the Company based upon a percent of
sales, and generally pay initial fees.
McDonald’ s has elected to allocate consideration in the franchise contract among lease and non-lease components in the same
manner that it has historically: rental income (lease), royalty income (non-lease) and initial fee income (non-lease). This disaggregation
and presentation of revenue is based on the nature, amount, timing and certainty of the revenue and cash flows. The allocation has been
determined based on a mix of both observable and estimated standalone selling prices (the price at which an entity would sell a promised
good or service separately to a customer).
Revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of:

McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 46
Leasing Arrangements
The Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and
generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Company determines
whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow , are generally for 20
years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. Renewal options are typically solely at the Company’ s
discretion. Escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index and fair-
value market adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally range from annually to every five years.
The following table provides detail of rent expense:
In millions 2019  2018  2017
Restaurants $1,530.4  $1,433.9  $1,562.5
Other 76.4  87.9  82.0
Total rent expense $1,606.8  $1,521.8  $1,644.5
Rent expense included percent rents in excess of minimum rents (in millions) as follows–Company-operated restaurants: 2019 –$74.4;
2018 –$82.1; 2017 –$115.6 . Franchised restaurants: 2019 –$200.7 ; 2018 –$200.8 ; 2017 –$204.9 .
The amount of the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability recorded at transition included known escalations and renewal option
periods reasonably assured of being exercised. Typically , renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the
associated asset lives of the building or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the sales performance of the
restaurant remains strong. Therefore, the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not
yet been exercised by the Company , and are not currently a future obligation.
The Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in our lessee portfolio. To the extent that
occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the Asset and Liability , the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to
Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related
occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of
the franchise arrangement.
In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as of fice buildings, vehicles and of fice equipment.
These leases are not a material subset of the Company’ s lease portfolio.
As the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease
liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a
lease within a particular currency environment. The weighted average discount rate used for operating leases was 4.0% as of
December 31, 2019 .
As of December 31, 2019, maturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases were as follows:
In millions Total *
2020 $ 1,161.9

Present value of lease liability $ 13,378.8
*Total lease payments include option periods that are reasonably assured of being exercised. See contractual cash outflows for
operating leases within the Contractual Obligations and Commitments section on page 19.
The increase in the present value of the lease liability since adoption of ASC 842 is approximately $0.9 billion . The lease liability will
continue to be impacted by new leases, lease modifications, lease terminations, reevaluation of likely-term due to new facts and
circumstances, and foreign currency .
As of December 31, 2019 , the W eighted Average Lease Term remaining that is included in the maturities of lease liabilities was 20 years.
As of December 31, 2018, prior to the adoption of ASC 842, future minimum payments required under existing operating leases with initial
terms of one year or more were:

Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors,
customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property , shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to
assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A
determination of the amount of accrual required, if any , for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter . The required
accrual may change in the future due to new developments in a particular matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement
strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material
adverse ef fect on its financial condition or results of operations.

▪Gains on sales of restaurant businesses
The Company’ s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market.
Resulting gains or losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring
part of our business.
▪Equity in earnings of unconsolidated af filiates
Unconsolidated af filiates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company
records equity in (earnings) losses from these entities representing McDonald’ s share of results. For foreign af filiated markets—primarily
China and Japan—results are reported after interest expense and income taxes.
▪Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net
Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions
for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-of fs due to restaurant reinvestment (including investment in EOTF),
strategic sale of properties, and other miscellaneous income and expenses.
▪Impairment and other charges (gains), net
Impairment and other charges (gains), net includes losses that result from the write down of goodwill and long-lived assets from their
carrying value to their fair value, as well as charges associated with strategic initiatives, such as refranchising and restructuring activities.
The realized gains/losses from the sale of McDonald's businesses in certain markets are reflected in this category , including the 2017 gain
on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong.
Income Taxes
Income before provision for income taxes, classified by source of income, was as follows:
In millions 2019  2018  2017
U.S. $2,159.1  $2,218.0  $2,242.0
Outside the U.S. 5,859.0  5,598.1  6,331.5
Income before provision for income taxes $8,018.1  $7,816.1  $8,573.5
In October 2016, the F ASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (T opic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory .” The
goal of this update was to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory .
The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective method, resulting in a cumulative catch up
adjustment of $57 million, the majority of which was recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and cash flows.
The Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%
from 35% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax
deferred. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date ef fects of the Tax Act by applying the guidance in
SAB 118. In 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its accounting for all of the enactment-
date income tax ef fects of the Tax Act.
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 48
SAB 118 measurement period
At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax ef fects of the Act
under ASC 740, Income T axes , primarily for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition
tax, and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings.
One-time transition tax: The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits ("E&P"), the tax on
which it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law . The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time
transition tax liability of approximately $1.2 billion  at December 31, 2017. Upon further analysis of the Tax Act and notices and regulations
issued and proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS, the Company increased its December 31, 2017 provisional
amount by approximately $75 million  during 2018. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eight-year period provided in
the Tax Act.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities: As of December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities
based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), by recording a provisional amount of
approximately $500 million . No adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018.
The provision for income taxes, classified by the timing and location of payment, was as follows:

At December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $360.3  million , of which $232.7  million  has an indefinite
carryforward. The remainder will expire at various dates from 2020 to 2038.
Prior to 2018, the Company's ef fective income tax rate was generally lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because foreign
income was generally subject to local statutory country tax rates that were below the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate and reflected the impact
of global transfer pricing. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate to 21%. As a result, the Company’ s 2019 and
2018 ef fective income tax rates are higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of state income taxes and
foreign income that is subject to local statutory country tax rates that are above the 21% U.S. statutory tax rate.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company’ s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1,439.1  million  and $1,342.8  million ,
respectively . After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $880 million  of the total as of December 31,
2019 would favorably af fect the ef fective tax rate if resolved in the Company’ s favor .
The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
In millions 2019  2018
Balance at January 1 $1,342.8  $1,180.4
Decreases for positions taken in prior years (18.3) (64.1)

Lapsing of statutes of limitations (12.2) (5.3)
Balance at December 31(1)$1,439.1  $1,342.8
(1) Of this amount, $1,285.3  million  and $1,313.7  million  are included in Long-term income taxes for 2019  and 2018 , respectively , and $138.8  million  and $12.5
million  are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets for 2019 and 2018, respectively , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remainder is
included in Deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing
adjustments related to the Company’ s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with
the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December
2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and, during 2019, the Company and the IRS Appeals team continued to have a
dialogue regarding these disagreed transfer pricing matters. As of December 31, 2019, the Company does not yet have a signed closing
agreement with the IRS related to the settlement of these issues.
In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’ s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS
issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR.
Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for
2011 and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process. The
Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under
audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to
$980 million  within the next 12 months, of which only an immaterial amount would favorably af fect the ef fective tax rate. This would be due
to the possible settlement of the IRS transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the
expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions.
In addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12
months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded.
While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that
the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate.
The Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company
is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009.
The Company had $174.4  million  and $152.0  million  accrued for interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively .
The Company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $39.9 million  in 2019 , $13.9 million  in 2018, and $34.9 million  in
2017 , which are included in the provision for income taxes.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries, which were
predominantly taxed in the U.S. as a result of the transition tax provisions enacted under the Tax Act. Management does not assert that
these previously-taxed unremitted earnings are indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. Accordingly , the Company has
provided deferred taxes for the tax ef fects incremental to the transition tax. W e have not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis
differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated to these accumulated undistributed earnings, as these outside
basis dif ferences are indefinitely reinvested.  A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our
outside basis dif ferences is not practicable.

Employee Benefit Plans
The Company's 401k Plan is maintained for U.S.-based employees and includes a 401(k) feature, as well as an employer match. The
401(k) feature allows participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period (with an annual true-up) from cash
contributions and through July 31, 2018 from shares released under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Ef fective August 1, 2018, the
contributions are matched only through cash contributions.
All current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in eight investment alternatives as well as
McDonald’ s stock in accordance with each participant’ s investment elections. Future participant contributions are limited to 20%
investment in McDonald’ s stock. Participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and future
contributions.
The Company also maintains certain nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred
contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the 401k Plan because of IRS limitations. The
investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the 401k Plan.  Total liabilities were
$435.0  million  at December 31, 2019  and $437.4  million  at December 31, 2018 , and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities.  At December 31, 2019 ,
derivatives with a fair value of $179.1  million  indexed to the Company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $187.7
million  indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in Miscellaneous other assets and Prepaid expenses and other
current assets, respectively , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of
the derivatives are recorded primarily in Selling, general & administrative expenses. Changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the
Company’ s stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or
shares.
Total U.S. costs for the 401k Plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2019 –$30.4; 2018 –
$18.0; 2017 –$19.3. Certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. also of fer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan
costs outside the U.S. were (in millions): 2019 –$35.3; 2018 –$33.7; 2017 –$43.3.
The total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $42.3 million  and $40.6 million  at December 31, 2019  and 2018 ,
respectively . Other post-retirement benefits and post-employment benefits were immaterial to the Consolidated Income Statement.

LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
At December 31, 2019 , the Company had a line of credit agreement, of which $3.5 billion  expires in December 2023 . The Company incurs
fees of 0.080 % per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are primarily based on
the Company’ s long-term credit rating assigned by Moody’ s and Standard & Poor ’s. In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused
lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies  at local market rates of interest .
The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 1.9% at December 31, 2019  (based on $242.4  million  of foreign
currency bank line borrowings and $899.3  million  of commercial paper outstanding) and 2.6% at December 31, 2018  (based on $253.5
million  of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $99.9 million  of commercial paper outstanding).

Company’ s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change
in the Company’ s business. Certain of the Company’ s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company
and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire
debt prior to maturity , either at par or at a premium over par . The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt
prior to maturity .

Share-based Compensation
The Company maintains a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including
stock options and restricted stock units to employees and nonemployee directors.  The number of shares of common stock reserved for
issuance under the plans was 42.5 million  at December 31, 2019 , including 26.5 million  available for future grants.
STOCK OPTIONS
Stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company’ s stock on
the date of grant. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant,
and generally expire 10 years  from the grant date.
Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the dif ference between the current market value of the Company’ s stock and the exercise
price. During 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $356.1  million , $364.4  million  and $353.6
million , respectively . Cash received from stock options exercised during 2019  was $350.5  million  and the tax benefit realized from stock
options exercised totaled $70.5 million . The Company uses treasury shares purchased under the Company’ s share repurchase program to
satisfy share-based exercises.
A summary of the status of the Company’ s stock option grants as of December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017 , and changes during the
years then ended, is presented in the following table:

RSUs
RSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant and are payable in either shares of McDonald’ s common stock or cash, at
the Company’ s discretion. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’ s stock at date of grant, and
prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. Separately , Company executives
have been awarded RSUs that vest based on Company performance. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative
TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs
that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in China. The spread of this virus has caused business
disruption beginning in January 2020, due to the closure of some restaurants, modified operating hours in certain restaurants that remain
open, and resulting traf fic declines in our China market. While the disruption is currently expected to be temporary , there is uncertainty
around the duration. Therefore, while we expect this matter to negatively impact our results, the related financial impact cannot be
reasonably estimated at this time. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the China market represented approximately 5% of
Systemwide sales, 1% of consolidated revenues and 3% of consolidated operating income.

Management’ s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 
The financial statements were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity and for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company’ s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
I.pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the Company;
II.provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
III.provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.
There are inherent limitations in the ef fectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or
overriding of controls. Accordingly , even ef fective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial
statement preparation. Further , because of changes in conditions, the ef fectiveness of internal controls may vary over time.
Management assessed the design and ef fectiveness of the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 .
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).
Based on management’ s assessment using those criteria, as of December 31, 2019 , management believes that the Company’ s internal
control over financial reporting is ef fective.
Ernst & Young, LLP , independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018  and 2017  and the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 .
Their reports are presented on the following pages. The independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise
management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. Management evaluates
the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action.

McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 55
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonald’ s Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McDonald’ s Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and
2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated
February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (T opic 842).
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’ s financial statements based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. W e believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to
which it relates.
McDonald's Corporation 2019 Annual Report 56
 Unrecognized T ax Benefits
Description of the
MatterAs described in the income taxes footnote to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’ s unrecognized tax
benefits, which includes transfer pricing matter s, totaled $1,439  million at December 31, 2019. The Company , like
other multi-n ational companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments
may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly , tax liabilities are recorded when, in
management’ s judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax
positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depend ing on management’ s
assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled.
Auditing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions
was challenging because the measurement is based on judgmental interpretations of complex tax laws and legal
rulings and because the pricing of the intercom pany transactions is based on studies that may produce a range of
outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm’ s-length transaction).
How W e
Addressed the
Matter in Our
AuditWe obtained an unders tanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the
Company’ s process to assess the technical merits and measure unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing
used in intercompany transactions. For examp le, we tested management’ s review of the unrecognized tax benefit
calculations, which included evaluation of the comparable transactions used to determine the ranges of outcomes,
pricing conc lusions reached in management’ s transfer pricing studies, and the assessment of other third-party
information.
With the assistance of our income tax professionals, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,
evaluating the technical merits of the Company’ s position and testing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits
related to transfer pricin g. For example, we assessed the inputs utilized and the pricing conclu sions reached in the
transfer pricing studies executed by managem ent, and compared the methods used to alternative methods and
industry benchmarks. We also reviewed the Company’ s communications with the relevant tax authorities and any
advice obtained by the Company from third-party advisors. In addition, we used our knowledge of historical settlement
activity , income tax laws, and other market information to evaluate the technical merits of the positions and the
measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of McDonald’ s Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited McDonald’ s Corporation’ s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established
in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, McDonald’ s Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, ef fective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated balance sheets of McDonald’ s Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, shareholders’  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019,
and the related notes and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’ s management is responsible for maintaining ef fective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’ s Assessment of Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. W e are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating ef fectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of ef fectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
