Additional Board Information
On October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the
terms of a settlement filed with the court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Elon
Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to
clarify certain of its terms, which was subsequently approved by the Court. Mr. Musk did not admit or deny any of the SEC’s
allegations, and there is no restriction on Mr. Musk’s ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board (other than as its Chair for
a specified time).
Audit Committee
The Board has four standing committees comprised solely of independent directors—the Audit Committee, the Compensation
Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee. The Audit Committee,
which has been established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58) of the Exchange Act, currently consists of Robyn Denholm,
Hiromichi Mizuno and James Murdoch, each of whom is “independent” as such term is defined for audit committee members by the
listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC
3
 
(“NASDAQ”). Ms. Denholm is the chair of the Audit Committee. The Board has determined that Ms. Denholm is an “audit
committee financial expert” as defined in the rules of the SEC.

Tesla’s common stock are required to report initial ownership of the Tesla common stock and any subsequent changes in ownership
to the SEC. Specific due dates have been established by the SEC, and Tesla is required to disclose in this Amendment any failure to
file required ownership reports by these dates. Based solely upon a review of forms filed with the SEC and the written
representations of such persons, Tesla is aware of no late Section 16(a) filings other than one late Form 4 report filed by Jerome
Guillen, who departed Tesla in 2021, reporting sales pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan, due to an administrative delay by Tesla.
Code of Business Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board sets high standards for Tesla’s workforce, officers and directors. Tesla is committed to establishing an operating
framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the Company and managing its affairs in a
manner consistent with rigorous principles of business ethics. Accordingly, Tesla has adopted a Code of Business Ethics, which it
recently updated in December 2021, which is applicable to Tesla and its subsidiaries’ directors, officers and personnel. Tesla has also
adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, in conjunction with our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and charters of the
standing committees of the Board, form the framework for Tesla’s corporate governance. The Code of Business Ethics and the
Corporate Governance Guidelines are each available on Tesla’s website at: http://ir.tesla.com/corporate. Tesla will disclose on its
website any amendment to the Code of Business Ethics, as well as any waivers of the Code of Business Ethics, that are required to
be disclosed by the rules of the SEC or NASDAQ.

ITEM 11.EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2021 should be read
together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
that are based on our current considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual
amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from current or planned
programs as summarized in this discussion.
The following discussion and analysis relates to the compensation arrangements for 2021 of (i) our principal executive
officer, (ii) our principal financial officer, (iii) the most highly compensated person, other than our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, who was serving as executive officer at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and (iv) our
former president of Tesla Heavy Trucking, who served in such capacity during part of 2021 (our “named executive officers”). We
had no other executive officers serving at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Our named executive officers for
fiscal year 2021 were:   Name  Position
Elon Musk  Technoking of Tesla and
Chief Executive Officer
Zachary Kirkhorn  Master of Coin and Chief Financial
Officer
Andrew Baglino  Senior Vice President, Powertrain and
Energy Engineering
Jerome Guillen  Former President, Tesla Heavy Trucking
  
Mr. Guillen departed Tesla in June 2021.
 
Compensation Philosophy
Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation
programs reflect this—and our startup origins—in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereas salary
or wages are intended to meet our employees’ near-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are an effective tool for
retaining employees long-term, as they vest incrementally over a period of time or upon the achievement of specified performance
milestones intended to be achieved over the medium- and long-term. Moreover, the closing prices of our common stock on the first
trading day of each of 2020, 2021 and 2022 were $86.05, $729.77 and $1,199.78, respectively (as adjusted for the five-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020, or the “Stock Split”). During periods in which our stock price and the
underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention impact is even greater. We believe that the potential for such increases
also creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity, which in turn aligns the interests of our employees with the long-
term interests of our stockholders. For these reasons, our goal is to provide each employee with the opportunity to participate in our
equity programs, with certain limited cash-based bonus programs serving generally to accommodate specific incentive structures or
liquidity needs. Combining salary or wages and our equity award program, we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is
competitive within specific roles and geographical markets.
In particular, we believe that compensation for the individuals who are responsible for Tesla’s strategic direction and
operations should motivate them to achieve sustainable stockholder value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simply remain at
Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain
some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, we are increasingly emphasizing for our executive officers the grant of
stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases
following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying
shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greater proportion of our executive officers’ total level of
compensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, a sustained decrease in our stock price or failure to achieve the
applicable operational milestones may result in a level of total compensation that is significantly less than that of such peer roles.
Likewise, our outside director compensation program has been comprised primarily of equity
5
 
awards that are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cash retainer payments that may be waived
at the election of each director.
We evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by
the Compensation Committee, particularly with respect to executive and director compensation. For example, if our stock price
experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in a persistent change to equity compensation, certain
adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes.
Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation
Role of Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief
Executive Officer and reviewing and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation
Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board: Ira
Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer of Tesla, and each of
whom qualifies as (i) an “independent director” under the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and (ii) an “outside director” under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).
Role of Compensation Consultants
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage and has from time to time engaged the services of outside
consultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment of Tesla’s compensation philosophy and programs, including
for executives and directors. For example, Compensia, Inc., a national compensation consulting firm (“Compensia”), was retained as
compensation consultant in 2020 and 2021 to advise the Compensation Committee with respect to Tesla’s compensation program for
its non-employee directors. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on the design of the Board’s equity award program for
the future period until the Compensation Committee’s and Board’s next review of the program, including a consideration of Tesla’s
exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock option awards to ensure
continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla’s stockholders. See “Executive Compensation—Compensation of
Directors—Non-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements” below for more detail regarding the review of Board
compensation during 2020 and 2021.
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions
Historically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and
considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers’ responsibilities, performance and
compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels for our senior
personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program’s ability to attract, retain and motivate
executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believes are qualitatively
commensurate with an executive officer’s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level, functional role, knowledge,
skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla’s performance. The Compensation Committee considers our Chief Executive
Officer’s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment, and approves the specific compensation for all
of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, which is approved by the Board). All such compensation
determinations by our Compensation Committee are largely discretionary.
The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during
Compensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the
Board acts on the Compensation Committee’s recommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the Board has established a
management committee under the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Award Committee”) to grant and administer
equity awards, subject to certain maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award Committee may grant
awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to
executive officer-level employees. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its
members, and the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by
the Board from time to time. The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award
Committee.

Role of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes
At the 2011 annual meeting of our stockholders and at each annual meeting held every three years since, including most
recently in 2020, we held triennial stockholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on the compensation of our named executive officers for
the immediately preceding fiscal years. Each time, our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named
executive officers, with over 83% of our stockholders present and entitled to vote at each meeting voting in favor of our
compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these results, and following consideration of them, the Compensation
Committee has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to evaluate our practices
frequently, including in response to future say-on-pay votes. Moreover, we are required to hold a vote at least every six years
regarding how often to hold a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. We held our most
recent such vote at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders indicated a preference for a triennial vote.
Consequently, the Board determined that we will hold a triennial stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named
executive officers until they consider the results of our next say-on-pay frequency vote, which will be held at the 2023 annual
meeting of stockholders.
Clawback Policy
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth a compensation recovery (“clawback”) policy with respect to any annual
incentive payment or long-term incentive payment that may be received by an executive officer, where such payment would be
predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement of our financial statements,
and a lower payment would have been made to the executive based upon the restated financial results. In such case, the Board has
the authority to seek to recover from the executive officer the amount by which such officer’s incentive payments for the relevant
period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.
Moreover, the terms of the performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January 2018 (the “2018 CEO
Performance Award”) include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our financial statements previously filed with the
SEC. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” under
this Item 11 below.
Current Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation
Overview and Fiscal Year 2021 Company Highlights
Our current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee,
generally consists of base salary and equity-based incentives, as well as other benefits generally available to employees. We combine
these elements in order to formulate compensation packages with the goal of providing, on a total basis, competitive pay and align
the interests of our named executive officers with long-term stockholder interests by tying the value of their compensation to our
long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives. In 2021, Tesla’s full-year
accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following:
 • Total revenues of $53.82 billion, representing an increase of $22.28 billion, or 70.64% compared to the prior year;
 • Net income attributable to common stockholders of $5.52 billion and an operating margin of 12.1%, representing
favorable changes of $4.80 billion and 5.8%, respectively, compared to the prior year;
 • Annual vehicle delivery and production records of 936,222 and 930,422 total vehicles, representing an increase of
87.38% and 82.53%, respectively, compared to the prior year;
 • 3.99 gigawatt hours of energy storage and 345 megawatts of solar energy systems deployed; and
 • Ongoing progress in the global growth of our manufacturing capabilities, including the commencement of builds of the
Model Y in Gigafactory Texas and equipment testing through the vehicle production process in Gigafactory Berlin.

Base Salary
The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer’s and other executive officers’ base
salaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance
and the competitive market. Because we currently do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash-
based element of our executive officers’ compensation structure.
The following table sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2021 for our named
executive officers:
    
Name  Ending Fiscal 2021

(1) Reflects an annualized rate assuming 52 weeks each comprised of five work days.
(2) Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law,
and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in
May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.
(3) Mr. Guillen departed Tesla in June 2021.
Equity-Based Incentives
Our equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. The
equity awards we have historically granted and currently grant are options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted
stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting, and we have granted to our named executive officers
both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement of specified Tesla performance
milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We are increasingly emphasizing for our named executive officers the grant of
stock option awards, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their grant.  Accordingly, all
equity awards granted to our executive officers in 2020 (the last year awards were granted to our executive officers) were in the form
of stock option awards. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers’ total compensation is entirely at risk,
depending on long-term stock price performance
While we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we
do not have an inflexible set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and
discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant. The Compensation
Committee considers, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive market factors, the
amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named executive officer, the impact of any dramatic changes in our
stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer, to determine the
level and types of equity awards that it approves. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our employees, including
executives, upon their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to new positions. Additionally, as part of our
ongoing executive compensation review and alignment process, we periodically grant additional equity awards to our executives.
See “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2021” under this Item 11 below.
The Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to
time. We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with
releasing material non-public information.
Severance and Change in Control Benefits
No named executive officer has a severance or change in control arrangement with Tesla, other than the vesting of the 2018
CEO Performance Award based solely upon the achievement of market capitalization milestones as measured at the time of a change
in control of Tesla. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief
8
 
Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” and “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in
Control” under this Item 11 below.
Bonus
We do not currently have or have planned, and historically we have rarely entered into, any specific arrangements with our
named executive officers providing for cash-based bonus awards.
Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation
We did not provide any non-equity incentive plan compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2021, and we do
not currently have or have planned any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive
plan compensation.
Perquisites
Generally, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers.
Health and Welfare Benefits
We provide the following benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees:
 • medical insurance including comprehensive transgender and fertility coverage, mental health, dental and vision;
 • adoption and surrogacy benefits;
 • confidential Employee Assistance Program counseling;
 • life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance;
 • a Section 401(k) plan where, beginning in 2022, Tesla will provide a company match equal to 50% of the employee’s
contribution, up to a maximum of 3% of the employee’s eligible compensation with a $3,000 annual cap;
 • an employee stock purchase plan;
 • short-and long-term disability insurance;
 • medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and
 • a health savings account.
Chief Executive Officer Compensation
Overview
Historically, in developing compensation recommendations for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee
has sought both to appropriately reward our Chief Executive Officer’s previous and current contributions and to create incentives for
our Chief Executive Officer to continue to contribute significantly to successful results in the future. Each of the 2018 CEO
Performance Award and the performance-based stock option award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in August 2012 (the
“2012 CEO Performance Award”) is focused on this latter objective, as it solely rewards future performance.
In addition to serving as our Chief Executive Officer since October 2008, Elon Musk has contributed significantly and
actively to us since our earliest days in April 2004 by recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to vehicle engineering and
design, raising capital for us and bringing investors to us and raising public awareness of Tesla.
Cash Compensation
Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law,
and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019
at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.

Historical Equity Compensation
Prior to the stock option awards made in December 2009, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity compensation for his services
for a period of five years.
In 2010 and 2011, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity grants, because the Compensation Committee believed his grants
made in December 2009 already provided sufficient motivation for Mr. Musk to perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer.
In August 2012, to create incentives for continued long-term success from the then-recently launched Model S program as
well as from Tesla’s then-planned Model X and Model 3 programs, and to further align executive compensation with increases in
stockholder value, the Board granted to Mr. Musk the 2012 CEO Performance Award, comprised of a stock option award to purchase
26,374,505 shares (as adjusted for the Stock Split) of Tesla’s common stock, representing 5% of Tesla’s total issued and outstanding
shares at the time of grant. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 equal vesting tranches, each requiring that Tesla meet a
combination of (i) the achievement of a specified operational milestone relating to development of Model X or Model 3, aggregate
vehicle production or a gross margin target, and (ii) a sustained incremental $4 billion increase in Tesla’s market capitalization from
$3.2 billion, Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of grant. The market capitalization conditions for all of the 10 vesting tranches
and nine of the 10 operational milestones have been achieved, and therefore nine of 10 tranches under the 2012 CEO Performance
Award have vested. As of April 29, 2022, only one operational milestone, requiring that Tesla achieve gross margin of 30% or more
for four consecutive quarters, has not been achieved and remains outstanding.
Prior to 2018, the only additional equity awards received by Mr. Musk related to certain immaterial awards granted during
2013 pursuant to a patent incentive program that was available to our employees generally.
2018 CEO Performance Award
Early in 2017, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award heading to substantial completion after having helped Tesla grow its
market capitalization to over $55 billion in just over five years, the independent members of the Board began preliminary
discussions regarding how to continue to incentivize Mr. Musk to lead Tesla through the next phase of its development. In January
2018, following more than six months of careful analysis and development led by the Compensation Committee, with participation
by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia and engagement with and feedback from our largest institutional
stockholders, the Board granted the 2018 CEO Performance Award to Mr. Musk. Such grant was subject to approval by a majority of
the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meeting of the stockholders to approve the
2018 CEO Performance Award. On March 21, 2018, such approval was obtained, with approximately 73% of the votes cast by such
disinterested shares voting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.
10
 
The 2018 CEO Performance Award is comprised of a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 101,320,210 shares (as
adjusted for the Stock Split) of Tesla’s common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranches that were each equivalent to 1%
of the issued and outstanding shares of Tesla’s common stock at the time of grant, at an exercise price of $70.01 per share (as
adjusted for the Stock Split). Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vests upon certification by the
Board that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100 billion for the first tranche and
increases by increments of $50 billion thereafter, and (ii) any one of the following 8 operational milestones focused on revenue or 8
operational milestones focused on profitability, has been met:
   Total Revenue*
(in billions)  Adjusted EBITDA**
(in billions)
$20.0  $1.5
$35.0  $3.0
$55.0  $4.5
$75.0  $6.0
$100.0  $8.0
$125.0  $10.0
$150.0  $12.0
$175.0  $14.0
 
* “Revenue” means total revenues as reported in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the
previous four consecutive fiscal quarters.
** “Adjusted EBITDA” means (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii) interest expense, (iii)
(benefit) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, and (v) stock-based compensation, as each such item
is reported in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal
quarters.
Any single operational milestone may only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding
market capitalization milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone is
achieved, it is forever deemed achieved for determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational
milestones will not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr. Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award.
Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalization milestones will be based on both (i) a six calendar
month trailing average of Tesla’s stock price as well as (ii) a 30 calendar day trailing average of Tesla’s stock price, in each case
based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each
then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational milestone will be adjusted to offset the impact of such
transactions to the extent they could be considered material to the achievement of those milestones.
In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including
Tesla’s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples
companies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided
revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets that aligned
with Tesla’s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization and operational milestones
to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla was required to add
approximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on a sustained
basis, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more than $163
billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018
CEO Performance Award.
In addition, Mr. Musk must continue to lead Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product
Officer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone is met
in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. With limited exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon
exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five years post-exercise. There will be no acceleration of vesting of the
2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk’s termination, death or disability, or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a
change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones will be based solely on the market capitalization milestones, with the
measurement of Tesla’s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common
11
 
stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock
before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received
by Tesla’s stockholders in the change in control.
In the event of a restatement of Tesla’s financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO
Performance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as
applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results
(less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award also
will be subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equity awards,
provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required by applicable law.
As of April 29, 2022, 11 operational milestones and 12 market capitalization milestones have been achieved, of which 11
operational milestones and 11 market capitalization milestones have also been certified by our Board of Directors. Consequently, 11
of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, corresponding to options to purchase an aggregate 92,876,855 shares of
Tesla’s common stock, have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share
and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.
Realized Compensation
For purposes of the table in “Summary Compensation Table” under this Item 11 below, we are required to report pursuant to
applicable SEC rules any stock option grants to Mr. Musk at values determined as of their respective grant dates and which are
driven by certain assumptions prescribed by Financial Accounting Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,
“Compensation–Stock Compensation” (“ASC Topic 718”). Moreover, we are required to report in “Pay Ratio Disclosure” under this
Item 11 below (i) Mr. Musk’s annual total compensation, (ii) the median of the annual total compensation of all Tesla employees
qualifying for this analysis, other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the methodology used for the table under
“Summary Compensation Table,” and (iii) the ratio of the former to the latter.
In addition, we are required to report in “2021 Option Exercises and Stock Vested” under this Item 11 below an amount for
the “value realized” upon: (i) any exercise by Mr. Musk of a stock option, which is based on the difference between the market price
of the underlying shares at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option, and (ii) any vesting of a restricted stock
unit award, based on the market price of the award at the time of vesting. Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr. Musk
does not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he does not also sell any shares or because he sells
only a number of shares sufficient to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or vesting.
As a result, there may be a significant disconnect between what is reported as compensation for Mr. Musk in a given year in
such sections and the value actually realized as compensation in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of
compensation in respect of past stock option grants to Mr. Musk, including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO
Performance Award, were structured to be incentives for future performance with their value realizable only if Tesla’s stock price
appreciated compared to the dates of the grants, and if the Company achieved applicable vesting requirements.
To supplement the disclosures in “Summary Compensation Table,” “Pay Ratio Disclosure” and “2021 Option Exercises and
Stock Vested” under this Item 11 below, we have included the following table, which shows the total realized compensation of
Mr. Musk for the last three fiscal years, as well as the ratio of Mr. Musk’s realized compensation to the median of the annual total
compensation of all other Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis as reported under “Pay Ratio Disclosure.” Realized
compensation is not a substitute for reported compensation in evaluating our compensation structure, but we believe that realized
compensation is an important factor in understanding that the value of compensation that Mr. Musk ultimately realizes is dependent
on a number of additional factors, including: (i) the vesting of certain of his option awards only upon the successful achievement of
a number of market capitalization increase and operational milestone targets, including milestones that have not yet been achieved
under each of the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award; (ii) the fact that Mr. Musk does not receive
any cash if he does not actually sell shares and thereby reduce his investment in
12
 
us, and he does not receive any cash to the extent that he sells only shares sufficient to cover income taxes with respect to his awards
(including stock options exercised solely to avoid their expiration in accordance with their terms); and (iii) the then-current market
value of our common stock at the times at which Mr. Musk may elect to actually sell his shares.

Compensation Table” under this Item 11 below under the columns “Salary,” “Bonus,” “Non‑Equity Incentive Plan
Compensation” and “All Other Compensation,” plus (ii) with respect to any stock option exercised by Mr. Musk in such year
in connection with which shares of stock were also sold other than to satisfy any resulting tax liability, the difference between
the market price of such shares at the time of exercise and the applicable exercise price of the option, plus (iii) with respect to
any restricted stock unit vested by Mr. Musk in such year in connection with which shares of stock were also sold other than
automatic sales to satisfy any withholding obligations related to such vesting, the market price of such shares at the time of
vesting, plus (iv) any cash actually received by Mr. Musk in respect of any shares sold to cover tax liabilities as described in

(3) Reflects the exercise of vested stock options scheduled to expire in 2022 as to which Mr. Musk paid the exercise price in
cash. Of the shares received upon exercise, 42.0% were immediately sold in order to pay federal and state tax withholding
from the option exercise. None of the proceeds from such sales were retained by Mr. Musk. Of the remaining shares, 94.6%
were retained by Mr. Musk. The other 5.4% automatically were sold as a result of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan put in place in
September 2021.
(4) Reflects, for 2019, the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law for part of such year. Commencing in
May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.
(5) Reflects the exercise of a vested stock option award as to which Mr. Musk paid the exercise price in cash. None of the shares
received upon exercise have been sold, and therefore this amount has not been received by Mr. Musk.

Tax and Accounting Considerations
Sections 280G and 409A. We have not provided or committed to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or
other reimbursement for tax amounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section 280G or Section 409A of the Code. Section 280G
and related Code sections provide that executive officers, directors who hold significant stockholder interests and certain other
service providers could be subject to significant additional taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in
control of Tesla that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a deduction on the amounts subject to the
additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director
or service provider of certain types receives “deferred compensation” that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A.
Tax Deduction Limit. Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation
greater than $1,000,000 paid in any fiscal year to certain executive officers. However, prior to the enactment of U.S. tax legislation
in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”), certain types of performance-based compensation were excluded from the $1,000,000 deduction
limit if specific requirements were met. Under the Tax Act, this exclusion for performance-based compensation is not available with
respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless the compensation is pursuant to a written binding contract which
was in effect on or before November 2, 2017, and which is not modified in any material respect on or after such date. Pursuant to the
Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code was expanded to cover additional
executive officers and other employees, including the chief financial officer, so that the compensation of the chief executive officer
and chief financial officer (at any time during the fiscal year), the three next most highly compensated executive officers during the
taxable year and any other individual who was considered a “covered employee” for any prior taxable year that begins after 2016,
will be subject to the $1,000,000 deductibility limit under Section 162(m) of the Code. Commencing with our 2018 fiscal year, to the
extent that the aggregate amount of any covered officer’s salary, bonus, any amount realized from certain option exercises and
vesting of restricted stock units or other equity awards, and certain other compensation amounts that are recognized as taxable
income by the officer exceeds $1,000,000, we will not be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax deduction for the amount over
$1,000,000 in that year, unless the compensation qualifies for the transition relief applicable to certain written binding contracts in
effect on or before November 2, 2017. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of
compensation paid to our executive officers.
Accounting Implications. We follow ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires
companies to measure the compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based
on the grant date “fair value” of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the
compensation tables below, even though our named executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic
718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income
statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee oversees Tesla’s compensation programs, policies and practices. The Compensation
Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with
management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Amendment.

common stock. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named
executive officers, which depends, among other things, on the market value of our common stock.
(2) This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718 of the options to
purchase shares of our common stock granted to the named executive officers. The assumptions used in the valuation of these
awards are set forth in Note 13, Equity Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included in the Original Form
10-K. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive
officers, which depends, among other things, on the market value of our common stock appreciating from that on the grant
date(s) of the option(s).
(3) Reflects the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law for part of 2019. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr.
Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.
(4) Reflects a temporary reduction to base salary in response to global market conditions.  
(5) Reflects an amount corresponding to previously-accrued paid time off that was applied toward the purchase of a Tesla vehicle
pursuant to a company-wide program.

Pay Ratio Disclosure
Tesla is committed to fair and competitive compensation for our employees. Moreover, Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla
and our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to a compensation arrangement in the 2018 CEO Performance Award that is
substantially tied to the appreciation of our market capitalization. Because equity awards are generally made available to Tesla
employees, this also means that Mr. Musk’s compensation is tied to the success of Tesla employees. We are providing a ratio of (i)
Mr. Musk’s 2021 annual total compensation to (ii) the median of the 2021 annual total compensation of all applicable qualifying
Tesla employees other than Mr. Musk, as if all such employees were named executive officers, in each case calculated pursuant to
the disclosure requirements of “Summary Compensation Table” above. As we continue our international expansion, the median
annual total compensation of our employees reflects differences in local compensation scales and practices abroad to a greater
extent.
Mr. Musk’s 2021 annual total compensation, as reported under “Summary Compensation Table,” was $0, and the median
2021 annual total compensation of all other qualifying employees, as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth below, was
$40,723. Consequently, the applicable ratio of such amounts for 2021 was 0.00:1.
Our methodology for identifying the median of the 2021 annual total compensation for each individual other than Mr. Musk
was as follows:
 • We determined that as of December 31, 2021, Tesla and all our subsidiaries had 100,121 individuals qualifying for this
analysis (full-time, part-time and temporary employees other than Mr. Musk, subject to the following bullet), of which
approximately 42% were based outside of the U.S. and approximately 39% were production line employees.
 • We did not include in the population of qualifying individuals any employees of staffing agencies whose compensation
is determined by such agencies.
 • We applied the requirements and assumptions required for the table under “Summary Compensation Table” above for
each of such individuals as if he or she was a named executive officer to calculate the total annual compensation,
including base salary or wages, performance-based commission payments, and equity awards based on their grant date
fair values.
 • We converted any payment earned or paid in a foreign currency to U.S. dollar using the average of the prevailing
conversion rates for the month of December 2021.
 • We selected the median of all total annual compensation amounts calculated in accordance with the foregoing.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
We do not have an employment agreement for any specific term with any of our named executive officers. Moreover, we do
not have any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that would result in payments to a named executive officer at, following, or in
connection with any termination of employment, including resignation, severance, retirement or a constructive termination of
employment of a named executive officer, or a change in control of Tesla (other than the vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance
Award based solely upon the achievement of market capitalization milestones as measured at the time of a change in control of
Tesla, which by its nature cannot be estimated at this time) or a change in the named executive officer’s responsibilities. See also
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” under this Item
11 above.
Employee Compensation Risks
The Compensation Committee oversees management of risks relating to Tesla’s compensation plans and programs. Tesla’s
management and the Compensation Committee have assessed the risks associated with Tesla’s compensation policies and practices
for all employees, including non-executive officers. These include risks relating to setting ambitious targets for our employees’
compensation or the vesting of their equity awards and our emphasis on at-risk equity-based compensation, and the potential impact
of such practices on the retention or decision-making of our employees, particularly our senior management. Based on the results of
this assessment, Tesla does not believe that its compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive
officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Tesla.
Compensation of Directors
2021 Director Compensation Table
The following table provides information concerning the compensation paid by us to each of our non-employee directors who
served during any part of fiscal year 2021. Elon Musk, who is a named executive officer, does not receive additional compensation
for his services as a director.
The awards with respect to which values are provided under the column “Option Awards” below are exclusively stock
options, which have realizable value only if they vest over time and to the extent, if any, that our stock price exceeds the applicable
exercise prices. The values provided below for these awards are based on applicable accounting standards, and do not necessarily
reflect the actual amounts realized or realizable pursuant to the underlying stock options.

19
 
payable to outside directors may be waived in whole or part at the election of the director. Beginning in 2021, seven of the
outside directors requested that the Company eliminate the future payment of all of their cash retainer amounts for service on
the Board unless the director notified otherwise.
(2) As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate number of shares underlying option awards outstanding for each of our non-
employee directors with such awards was:

approved by the Board until July 2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise
amends such resolution.

Non-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements
Overview and Philosophy
The compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy
for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with
the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our
general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the
equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and
accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates
and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. The remaining portion of our directors’
compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be
waived at the election of each director. Consequently, a large portion and in some cases, the entirety, of each of our non-employee
directors’ compensation is entirely at risk, and fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested stock options
then held by each of our non-employee directors being out-of-the-money.
In 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Director Compensation Policy with the aid of Compensia and
in light of Tesla’s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock option
awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla’s stockholders. Following such review, the
Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants
of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previously approved by the Board until July
2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. In June 2021,
the Board unanimously approved and adopted this resolution. The Compensation Committee intends to make further
recommendations with respect to the Board’s compensation program for directors, if any, who join the Board after the date of this
resolution, as well as for future periods of service by existing directors, following further periodic reviews.
Other Information
20
 
If, following a change in control of Tesla, the service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to
the director shall fully vest and become immediately exercisable.
Non-employee directors may also have their travel, lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board
committee meetings reimbursed by Tesla.
Pledging of Shares
The ability of our directors and executive officers to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherently
related to their compensation due to our use of equity awards and promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture. Moreover,
providing these individuals flexibility in financial planning without having to rely on the sale of shares aligns their interests with
those of our stockholders.
In order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our
directors and executive officers. Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options,
warrants, restricted stock units or other rights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum
aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged stock does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total
value of the pledged stock.
Example: A director pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share.
The director may borrow up to 25% of 1,000 x $800, or $200,000, against such shares. If the stock price later
increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $200,000 against the pledged shares.
If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $400,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200, the
director must repay $100,000 to maintain compliance with the 25% limit under the pledging policy.
See “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters—Ownership of
Securities” under Item 12 below for information regarding any shares pledged by our directors or executive officers as of December
31, 2021; however, such pledging does not indicate the extent to which there may be actual borrowings against such shares as of
such date. Tesla management monitors compliance with this policy by reviewing and, if necessary, reporting to the Board or its
committees the extent to which any officer or director has pledged shares of Company stock. We believe that this monitoring is
effective and includes appropriate controls, and we have confirmed that each of our directors and executive officers who have
pledged stock are and have been compliant with this policy since our last confirmation.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson served as members of the Compensation Committee during
2021. None of such persons is or was formerly an officer or an employee of Tesla. During 2021, no interlocking relationships existed
between any member of Tesla’s Board or Compensation Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation
committee of any other company.

Ownership of Securities
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of Tesla’s common stock, as of
December 31, 2021, for the following:
 • each person (or group of affiliated persons) who is known by us to beneficially own 5% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock;
 • each of our non-employee directors;
 • each of our current executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in Item 11 above; and
 • all current directors and executive officers of Tesla as a group.
In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that
person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options or other convertible securities held by that
person or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2021. We did not deem these shares
outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Applicable percentage ownership
is based on 1,033,171,787 shares of Tesla’s common stock outstanding at December 31, 2021.
Unless otherwise indicated, all persons named below can be reached at Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725.

ITEM 13.CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Review of Related Party Transactions
In accordance with the charter for the Audit Committee of the Board, our Audit Committee reviews and approves in advance
any proposed related person transactions.
For purposes of these procedures, “related person” and “transaction” have the meanings contained in Item 404 of Regulation
S-K.
The individuals and entities that are considered “related persons” include:
 • Directors and executive officers of Tesla;
 • Any person known to be the beneficial owner of five percent or more of Tesla’s common stock (a “5% Stockholder”);
and
 • Any immediate family member, as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, of a director, executive officer or 5%
Stockholder.
In accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures, the Audit Committee must review and approve all
transactions in which (i) Tesla or one of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) a related
person has a direct or indirect material interest, other than transactions available to all Tesla employees generally.
In assessing a related party transaction brought before it for approval the Audit Committee considers, among other factors it
deems appropriate, whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an
unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction. The
Audit Committee may then approve or disapprove the transaction in its discretion.
Any related person transaction will be disclosed in the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC.

Related Party Transactions
SpaceX
Elon Musk is the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technical Officer and a significant stockholder of SpaceX. Kimbal Musk
and Antonio Gracias, who are or were members of the Board in 2021, are also members of the board of directors of SpaceX. In
addition, certain members of the Board, and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have made minority investments in SpaceX.
SpaceX has purchased and may purchase in the future certain vehicle components from Tesla, including with modifications
for non-vehicle applications. The prices for such components and any associated labor and support, which were negotiated in good
faith and were consistent with prices offered to other third parties to whom any such components have been sold, were $2.8 million
in the aggregate in 2021 and $0.2 million in the aggregate in 2022 through March.
SpaceX purchased solar modules from Tesla for an aggregate $0.04 million in 2021. The prices were negotiated in good faith.
SpaceX purchased refurbished power supplies and related services from Tesla for an aggregate $0.1 million in 2021. The
prices were negotiated in good faith.
Tesla has provided SpaceX certain engineering support and resources from time to time upon the mutual agreement of the
parties and at costs per hour that were negotiated in good faith. SpaceX incurred an aggregate $0.01 million in 2021 for such support
and resources.
In 2020, Tesla granted to SpaceX a limited non-perpetual license to certain software, as to which Tesla retains all intellectual
property rights. Such license was renewed in 2022 and will expire no later than 2023. SpaceX incurred an aggregate $0.1 million in
2021 and is expected to incur an aggregate $0.03 million in 2022 for the license. The aggregate fees for the license through its
expected term were negotiated in good faith.
In 2022, Tesla purchased back from SpaceX a transformer in exchange for an aggregate $0.05 million in design services
which Tesla provided.  
Since April 2016, SpaceX has invoiced Tesla for our use of an aircraft owned and operated by SpaceX at rates determined by
Tesla and SpaceX, subject to rules of the Federal Aviation Administration governing such arrangements. Tesla incurred $0.5 million
in 2021 and has incurred $0.1 million in 2022 through March.
Other Transactions
 
Tesla periodically does business with certain entities its directors are affiliated with Such transactions are done on terms no less
favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances.
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into offer letters with our executive officers. We have also entered into
indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In
relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld
the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification
agreement with us in November 2021 to indemnify the Company for additional taxes owed, if any.

Director Independence
The Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the
independence of its non-employee members as defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ and applicable laws. The Board
undertook an analysis for each non-employee director and considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director’s
other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board determined that with
respect to each of its current members other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer, and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon
Musk’s brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated in the listing standards of
NASDAQ or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of
a director, and that each such member is an “independent director” as defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ and applicable
laws.
In particular, the Board reviewed the following considerations:
 • Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias (prior to his departure from the Board in October 2021), James Murdoch, Elon Musk,
Kimbal Musk, and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have made minority investments in certain companies or
investment funds (i) of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant stockholders, directors, officers, or
managers, and/or (ii) with which Tesla has had certain relationships, such as those set forth in “Related Party
Transactions” under this Item 13 above. The Board concluded that none of these investments are material so as to
impede the exercise of independent judgment by any of Messrs. Ehrenpreis, Gracias or Mr. Murdoch, and that none of
them has a direct or indirect interest in any transaction between Tesla and another company such as those set forth in
“Related Party Transactions” under this Item 13 above.
 • Mr. Gracias is a director of SpaceX, (i) of which Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk are also directors, and (ii) with which
Tesla has had certain relationships, such as those set forth in “Related Party Transactions—SpaceX” under this Item 13
above. The Board concluded that Mr. Gracias is an experienced investment professional who has served on the boards
of multiple companies without conflict or impairment of independent judgment.
 • Lawrence J. Ellison, and/or entities affiliated with him, have purchased certain Tesla products and services from Tesla.
The Board concluded that such purchases were negotiated and completed through ordinary course sales processes in
good faith on terms generally available to similar customers, and would not impair the independent judgment of Mr.
Ellison.
 • Mr. Ellison is an officer of a company from which Tesla has purchased business services. The Board concluded that
such purchases were for standard offerings in the ordinary course of business pursuant to good faith contracting
processes in which Mr. Ellison was neither involved nor had any material interest.
 • As previously disclosed by Tesla, Elon Musk had previously agreed to provide certain directors’ and officers’
indemnity coverage to us from his personal funds, which the Board concluded did not impair the independent
judgment of the other members of the Board.
