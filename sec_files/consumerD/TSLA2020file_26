Solar Energy Offerings
The major components of our retrofit solar energy systems include solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical current,
inverters that convert the electrical output from the panels to a usable current compatible with the electric grid, racking that attaches
the solar panels to the roof or ground, electrical hardware that connects the solar energy system to the electric grid, and our
monitoring device. We purchase the majority of these components, and we do so from multiple sources to ensure competitive
pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products. In addition to
selling retrofit solar energy systems to customers and certain channel partners, we also make them available through lease and
power purchase agreement (“PPA”) arrangements, currently with 20-year terms and typically with renewal options, and a
subscription-based sale of solar power, which is currently available in California.
In 2019, we commenced direct customer and channel partner sales of the third generation of our Solar Roof, which features
aesthetically pleasing and durable glass roofing tiles designed to complement the architecture of homes and commercial buildings
while turning sunlight into electricity. We are ramping the volume production of this version of the Solar Roof at Gigafactory New
York, and are increasing our installation capabilities by training our personnel and third party partners.
Technology
Automotive
Our core vehicle technology competencies include battery and powertrain engineering and manufacturing, as well as our
ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. Our core intellectual property includes our
electric powertrain and our work on developing self-driving technologies. Our powertrain consists of our battery pack, power
electronics, motor, gearbox, and control software. We offer several powertrain variants for our vehicles that incorporate years of
research and development. In addition, we have designed our vehicles to incorporate the latest advances in consumer technologies,
such as mobile computing, sensing, displays, and connectivity.
Battery and Powertrain
We optimize the design of the lithium-ion cells we use and of our battery packs to achieve high energy density at decreasing
costs while also maintaining safety, reliability and long life in the rigors of an automotive environment. Our proprietary technology
includes systems for high density energy storage, cooling, safety, charge balancing, structural durability, and electronics
management. We have also pioneered advanced manufacturing techniques to manufacture large volumes of battery packs with high
quality at low cost. Moreover, we maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have
built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-ion cell vendors, chemistry types and performance characteristics. We believe that
the flexibility that we have built into our designs, combined with our research and real-world performance data, will enable us to
continue to evaluate new battery cells and optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles.
The power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout our vehicles as needed,
convert direct current from the battery pack into alternating current to drive our vehicles’ motors (and vice versa from an external
electricity source to charge the battery pack), and provide regenerative braking functionality. The primary technological advantages
to our proprietary power electronics designs include the ability to drive large amounts of electrical current in a small physical
package with high efficiency and low cost, and to recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources at home, at the office or on the
road, including at our Superchargers.
We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-
wheel drive configuration. Tesla’s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels.
The near-instantaneous response of the motors, combined with low centers of gravity, provides drivers with controlled performance
and increased traction control. We are also developing vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further
increased performance.
3
 
Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software
The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are
numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors.
Software algorithms control traction, vehicle stability, the acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle, climate control and
thermal management, and are also used extensively to monitor the charge state of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety
systems. Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior,
manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of
the user interfaces, internally.
Self-Driving Development
We have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to achieve self-driving vehicles. We are equipping all
new Tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full self-driving in the future, including a new powerful and proprietary on-board
computer that we introduced in 2019. This hardware suite enables field data from the on-board camera, radar, ultrasonics, and GPS
to continually train and improve our neural network for real-world performance.
Currently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options, including
auto-steering, traffic aware cruise control, automated lane changing, automated parking, driver warning systems, and a Smart
Summon feature that enables vehicles to be remotely summoned over short distances in parking lots and driveways. These systems
relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, and the field data feedback loops from the
on-board hardware, as well as over-the-air firmware updates, allow us to improve them over time. Although at present the driver is
ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that allows our
customers to rely on them much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit.
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy Storage Products
We are leveraging many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles to advance our energy storage products,
including high density energy storage, cooling, safety, charge balancing, structural durability, and electronics management. By
taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we are able to maximize manufacturing capacity to produce our
Powerwall, Powerpack and Megapack products. Additionally, we are making significant strides in the area of bi-directional, grid-
tied power electronics that enable us to interconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing
fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption.
Solar Energy Systems
We are continually innovating and developing new technologies to facilitate the growth of our solar energy business. For
example, we have developed proprietary software to reduce solar energy system design and installation timelines and costs, and the
Solar Roof is designed to work seamlessly with Powerwall.
Design and Engineering
Automotive
We have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components
and systems. We design, engineer and test bodies, chassis, exteriors, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical
systems in-house, and to a lesser extent, in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided
design and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We continue to grow our
capabilities, including for on-site crash testing, durability testing and component validation.
4
 
Additionally, our team has expertise in selecting and working with various materials. For example, given the impact of mass
on range, which is very important for passenger vehicles, Model S and Model X are built with lightweight aluminum bodies and
chassis which incorporate a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize vehicle weight, and Model 3 and Model
Y are built with a mix of materials to be lightweight and safe while also increasing cost-effectiveness for these mass-market
vehicles. On the other hand, to accommodate the durability required of work vehicles, we plan to use a thick cold-rolled stainless
steel alloy and ultra-strong glass for Cybertruck while employing our expertise in battery engineering to maintain excellent range.
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy Storage Products
We have an in-house engineering team that both designs our energy storage products themselves, and works with our
residential, commercial and utility customers to design bespoke systems incorporating our products. Our team’s expertise in
electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering enables us to create integrated energy storage solutions that meet the various
and particular needs of our customers.
Solar Energy Systems
We also have an in-house team that designs a customized solar energy system or Solar Roof for each of our customers,
including an integrated energy storage system when requested by the customer. We have developed software that simplifies and
expedites the design process and optimizes the design to maximize the energy production of each system. This team completes a
structural analysis of each building and produces a full set of structural design and electrical blueprints that contain the
specifications for all system components. Additionally, this team specifies complementary mounting and grounding hardware
where required.
Sales and Marketing
Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we
will continue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped
us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs.
Automotive
Direct Sales
We market and sell our vehicles directly to customers using means that we believe will maximize our reach, improve the
overall customer experience and maximize capital efficiency. Currently, our sales channels include our website and an international
network of company-owned stores. In some states, we have also opened galleries to educate and inform customers about our
products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better
control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles and charging, maintain
and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback.
We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our current
sales channels. Sales of vehicles in the automobile industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to
volatility from time to time.
Used Vehicle Sales
Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the sale of a new Tesla vehicle with a customer’s trade-
in needs for their existing Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire through trade-ins are
subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third-parties. We also receive used Tesla vehicles to resell through lease
returns and other sources.
5
 
Public Charging
We continue to build out our global Supercharger network for our customers’ convenience, including to enable long-distance
travel and urban ownership, which is a part of our strategy to remove a barrier to the broader adoption of electric vehicles caused by
the perception of limited range. Each Tesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high-speed charger designed to recharge a Tesla
vehicle significantly more quickly than other charging options, and we continue to evolve our technology to allow for even faster
charging times at lower cost to us. Where possible, we are co-locating Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to
further reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations typically are strategically placed along well-traveled
routes and in dense city centers to allow Tesla vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable and ubiquitous charging with
convenient, minimal stops. Use of the Supercharger network is either free under certain sales programs or requires a competitive
fee.
We also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail, and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting
employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers. These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy
Tesla Wall Connectors to provide charging to Tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses. We also
work with single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities to deploy home charging solutions in our communities.
Energy Generation and Storage
We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to individuals, commercial and industrial customers and utilities
through a variety of channels.
In the U.S., we offer residential solar and energy storage products directly through our website, stores and galleries, as well
as through our network of channel partners. Outside of the U.S., we use our international sales organization and a network of
channel partners to market and sell these products for the residential market. We also sell Powerwall directly to utilities. In the case
of products sold to such utilities or channel partners, such partners typically sell and install the product in customer homes.
We sell Powerpack and Megapack systems to commercial and utility customers through our international sales organization,
which consists of experienced energy industry professionals in all of our target markets, as well as through our channel partner
network. In certain jurisdictions, we also sell installed solar energy systems (with or without energy storage) to commercial
customers through cash, lease and PPA transactions.
Service and Warranty
Automotive
Service
We provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through an expanding fleet of Tesla
Mobile Service technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift remotely at customers’ homes or other locations.
Performing vehicle service ourselves provides us with the capability to identify problems, find solutions, and incorporate
improvements faster, and optimize logistics and inventory for service parts better, than traditional automobile manufacturers. Our
vehicles are also designed with the capability to wirelessly upload data to us via an on-board system with cellular connectivity,
allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle.
Vehicle Limited Warranty and Extended Service Plans
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. Each new vehicle has a four year or 50,000 mile
New Vehicle Limited Warranty, subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system, battery and drive unit,
and body rust perforation. For the battery and drive unit on our current new Model S and Model X vehicles, we offer an eight year,
150,000 mile limited warranty, with minimum 70% retention of battery capacity over the warranty period. For the battery and drive

In addition to the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, we currently offer for Model S and Model X Extended Service plans for
new vehicles in specified regions. The Extended Service plans cover the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for up to an
additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 miles after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy Storage Systems
We generally provide a 10-year “no defect” and “energy retention” warranty with every current Powerwall and a 15-year “no
defect” and “energy retention” warranty with every current Powerpack or Megapack system. Pursuant to these energy retention
warranties, we guarantee that the energy capacity of the applicable product will be at least a specified percentage (within a range up
to 80%) of its nameplate capacity during specified time periods, depending on the product, battery pack size and/or region of
installation, and subject to specified use restrictions or kWh throughputs caps. In addition, we offer certain extended warranties,
which customers are able to purchase from us at the time they purchase an energy storage system, including a 20 year extended
protection plan for Powerwall and a selection of 10 or 20 year performance guarantees for Powerpack and Megapack. In
circumstances where we install a Powerwall or Powerpack system, we also provide certain warranties on our installation
workmanship. All of the warranties for our energy storage systems are subject to customary limitations and exclusions.
Solar Energy Systems
For retrofit solar energy systems, we provide a workmanship warranty for up to 20 years from installation and a separate
warranty against roof leaks. We also pass-through the inverter and module manufacturer warranties (typically 10 years and 25 years
respectively). When we lease a retrofit solar energy system, we compensate the customer if their system produces less energy than
guaranteed over a specified period. For the Solar Roof, we provide a warranty against defects for 25 years, a 25 year weatherization
warranty and a power output warranty. For all systems (retrofit and Solar Roof) we also provide service and repair (either under
warranty or for a fee) during the entire term of the customer relationship.
Financial Services
Automotive
Purchase Financing and Leases
We offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and
Asia through various financial institutions. In certain international markets, we offer resale value guarantees to customers who
purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners, under which those customers have
the option of selling their vehicles back to us at preset future dates, generally at the end of the terms of the applicable loans or
financing programs, for pre-determined resale values. In certain markets, we also offer vehicle buyback guarantees to financial
institutions, which may obligate us to repurchase the vehicles for pre-determined prices.
We also currently offer leasing directly through our local subsidiaries for Model S, Model X and Model 3 in the U.S. and for
Model S and Model X in Canada.
Insurance
In August 2019, we launched an insurance product designed for our customers, which offers rates that are often better than
other alternatives. This product is currently available in California, and we plan to expand both the markets in which we offer
insurance products and our ability to offer such products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for
our customers.
7
 
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy Storage Systems
We currently offer a loan product to residential customers who purchase Powerwall together with a new solar energy system,
and lease and PPA options to commercial customers who purchase a Powerpack system together with a new solar energy system.
We intend to introduce financial services offerings for customers who purchase standalone energy storage products in the future.
Solar Energy Systems
We are an industry leader in offering innovative financing alternatives that allow our customers to take direct advantage of
available tax credits and incentives to reduce the cost of owning a solar energy system through a solar loan, or to make the switch
to solar energy with little to no upfront costs under a lease or PPA. Our solar loan offers third-party financing directly to a qualified
customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system. We are not a party to the loan agreement between the
customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan. Our solar lease
offers customers a fixed monthly fee, at rates that typically translate into lower monthly utility bills, and an electricity production
guarantee. Our solar PPA charges customers a fee per kWh based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy
systems. We monetize the customer payments we receive from our leases and PPAs through funds we have formed with investors.
We also intend to introduce financial services offerings for our Solar Roof customers in the future.
Manufacturing
We manufacture our products and related components primarily at the Fremont Factory and at nearby facilities in the Bay
Area, California; Gigafactory Nevada near Reno, Nevada; Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, New York; and Gigafactory Shanghai
in China. We have also selected a site near Berlin, Germany to build a factory for the European market, which we refer to as
Gigafactory Berlin.
Manufacturing Facilities in the Bay Area, California
We manufacture our vehicles, and certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality
standards, at our manufacturing facilities in the Bay Area in California, including the Fremont Factory, and other local
manufacturing facilities. Our Bay Area facilities contain several manufacturing operations, including stamping, machining, casting,
plastics, body assembly, paint operations, seat assembly, final vehicle assembly and end-of-line testing for our vehicles, as well as
production of battery packs and drive units for Model S and Model X. Some major vehicle component systems are purchased from
suppliers; however, we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at our Bay Area facilities.
Gigafactory Nevada
Gigafactory Nevada is a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material, cell, module and
battery pack production in one location. We use the battery packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada for Model 3, Model Y and
our energy storage products. We also manufacture Model 3 and Model Y drive units at Gigafactory Nevada. Finally, the assembly
of Megapack systems takes place at Gigafactory Nevada, allowing us to ship deployment-ready systems directly to customers.
We have designed Gigafactory Nevada to allow us access to high volumes of lithium-ion battery cells while achieving a
significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs, and we have an agreement with Panasonic to partner with us on Gigafactory
Nevada with investments in production equipment that it is using to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Given its
importance to the production of our vehicle and energy storage products, in particular Model 3, Model Y and Megapack, we
continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional production output there.

Gigafactory New York
We have primarily used our manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, which we refer to as Gigafactory New York, for
the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components, and
Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. In particular, our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New
York are increasing significantly as we ramp the production of the third generation of our Solar Roof there.
Gigafactory Shanghai
In December 2019, we commenced production of Model 3 vehicles at Gigafactory Shanghai, which we have established in
order to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs
and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported into China from the U.S. At Gigafactory Shanghai, we have installed annual
production capacity for 150,000 Model 3 vehicles that we believe we will eventually be able to push to actual rates of production in
excess of such number, subject to local production of battery packs, which we began ramping there later than other processes. We
have also commenced construction of the next phase of Gigafactory Shanghai to add Model Y manufacturing capacity at least
equivalent to that for Model 3. Much of the investment in Gigafactory Shanghai has been and is expected to continue to be
provided through local debt financing, including a RMB 9.0 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) fixed asset term
facility and a RMB 2.25 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) working capital revolving facility that our subsidiary
entered into in December 2019. We are supplementing such financing with limited direct capital expenditures by us, at a lower cost
per unit of production capacity than that of Model 3 production at the Fremont Factory.
Other Manufacturing
Generally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-
competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing, including at our planned Gigafactory
Berlin.
Supply Chain
Our products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have
developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain
components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of
pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.   
As is the case for most automotive companies, most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single
suppliers. Certain key components we use have multiple available sources, and we work to qualify multiple suppliers for each such
component where it is sensible to do so, in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate
risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.  
Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these
materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and
demand and market speculation. We currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies in order to meet the
needs of our operations.
Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations
Globally, both the operation of our business by us and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by a
number of government programs, incentives and other arrangements. Our business and products are also subject to a number of
governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.
9
 
Programs and Incentives
California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives
We have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced
Transportation Financing Authority (“CAEATFA”) that provide multi-year sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing
equipment that will be used for specific purposes, including the expansion and ongoing development of Model S, Model X, Model
3, Model Y and future electric vehicles and the expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in California.
Gigafactory Nevada—Nevada Tax Incentives
In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and
Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for sales, use, real property, personal property and employer excise taxes,
discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits. These incentives are available for the applicable periods
beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on either June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2034 (depending on the incentive). Under these
agreements, we were eligible for a maximum of $195.0 million of transferable tax credits, subject to capital investments by us and
our partners for Gigafactory Nevada of at least $3.50 billion, which we exceeded during 2017, and specified hiring targets for
Gigafactory Nevada, which we exceeded during 2018. As a result, as of December 31, 2018, we had earned the maximum amount
of credits.
Gigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease
We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”) for
Gigafactory New York, which was constructed on behalf of the SUNY Foundation. Under the lease and a related research and
development agreement, there continues to be, on behalf of the SUNY Foundation, installation of certain utilities and other
improvements and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment designated by us to be used at Gigafactory New York. The terms
of such agreement require us to comply with a number of covenants, including required hiring and cumulative investment targets,
which we have met to date as of the applicable measurement dates.
Gigafactory Shanghai—Lease and Land Use Rights
We have a lease arrangement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the
terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting
at the end of 2023, which we believe will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production at Gigafactory Shanghai were far
lower than the volumes we are forecasting.
Tesla Regulatory Credits
In connection with the production, delivery, placement into service and ongoing operation of our zero emission vehicles,
charging infrastructure and solar systems in global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory
credits. We have sold these credits, and will continue to sell future credits, to automotive companies and other regulated entities
who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. For example, under California’s Zero
Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted California’s standard, vehicle manufacturers are required to earn
or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV credits, for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws provide that
automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity
required by those laws. Tesla also earns other types of saleable regulatory credits in the United States and abroad, including
greenhouse gas, fuel economy, renewable energy, and clean fuels credits. Likewise, several U.S. states have adopted procurement
requirements for renewable energy production. These requirements enable companies deploying solar energy to earn tradable
credits known as Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (“SRECs”).
10
 
Energy Storage Systems—Incentives
The regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development. Nevertheless, there are various policies,
incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage. For example,
energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 26% tax credit in 2020 with a ramp down in 2021
and beyond under Section 48(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the IRC, as described below. In addition, California and a
number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify
for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in
wholesale energy markets. For example, in late 2016, FERC issued a final rule, Order No. 821, to further break down barriers
preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets. Order 821 is currently under review before the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Solar Energy Systems—Government and Utility Programs and Incentives
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce
the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax
abatements and rebates.
The federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit (“ITC”) under two sections of the IRC:
Section 48 and Section 25D. Section 48(a)(3) of the IRC allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 26% of qualified expenditures for a
commercial solar energy system that commences construction by December 31, 2020. The credit then declines to 22% in 2021 and
a permanent 10% thereafter. We claim the Section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial
projects, based on ownership of the solar energy system. The federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible
commercial solar energy systems. Section 25D of the IRC allows a homeowner-taxpayer to claim a credit of 26% of qualified
expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by December 31, 2020. The
credit then declines to 22% in 2021 and is scheduled to expire thereafter. Customers who purchase their solar energy systems for
cash or through our solar loan offering are eligible to claim the Section 25D investment tax credit.
In addition to the federal ITC, many U.S. states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentives for solar energy
systems.
Regulations
Vehicle Safety and Testing
Our vehicles are subject to, and comply with or are otherwise exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards (“FMVSS”). Our vehicles fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions, and we
expect future Tesla vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies. Additionally,
there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS, and while we anticipate compliance, there is no assurance until
final regulation changes are enacted.
As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS, as well as the NHTSA bumper
standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the U.S. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles,
such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements, and electric vehicle requirements. We are also required to
comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements,
consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death
and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements.
The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information
regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, this law allows inclusion of city
and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are
conducted.
11
 
Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of
those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. The European Union has
established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in 2020, and there is also
regulatory uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.  These changes could impact the
rollout of new vehicle features in Europe.
Self-Driving
There are no federal U.S. regulations pertaining to the safety of self-driving vehicles; however, NHTSA has established
recommended guidelines. Certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering
them. This patchwork increases the legal complexity for our vehicles. In Europe, certain vehicle safety regulations apply to self-
driving braking and steering systems, and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of self-driving vehicles.
Self-driving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and foreign countries,
and may create restrictions on self-driving features that we develop.
Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
State laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle
manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state. As we open additional Tesla
stores and service centers, we secure dealer licenses (or their equivalent) and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly
to consumers. Certain states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer,
or otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not
licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the transfer of title out of the state. In such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve
an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur.
As we expand our retail footprint in the U.S., some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of
our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate
existing stores or expand to new locations. We expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business
model. In addition, we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing
laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to Tesla’s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations, and we
intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell and service our own vehicles.
Battery Safety and Testing
Our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-
ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean
vessel, rail, truck, or air. We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs, demonstrating our compliance
with applicable regulations.
We use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage, and
disposal of our battery packs is regulated under federal law. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to
recycle our battery packs and we are also developing our own recycling technology. 
Solar Energy—General
We are not a “regulated utility” in the U.S., although we are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to
solar and battery storage providers. To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities. In most cases,
interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the public utility commission or other
regulatory body. 
Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases, PPAs and subscription agreements,
face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.
12
 
Solar Energy—Net Metering
Most states in the U.S. have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers.
Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their
utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the
grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering, or have
proposed to do so.
Solar Energy—Mandated Renewable Capacity
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production, such as an enforceable
renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total
electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems. In SREC state
markets, the RPS requires electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators. The SREC program
provides a means for the generation of SRECs, which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who
surrender the SRECs to the state to prove compliance with the state’s renewable energy mandate.
Competition
Automotive
The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future
as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our
vehicles’ capabilities.
We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on
their propulsion technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and
Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets.
Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however,
many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle
market. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle
market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles, particularly those fueled by electricity, relative to the internal
combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the
U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In
addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. 
Our vehicles also compete in the market based on the compelling user experience that they offer. We believe that a key
factor in our success will be our Autopilot and FSD technologies that currently enable the driver-assistance features in our vehicles,
and in which we are making significant strides through our proprietary and powerful FSD computer and remotely updateable
artificial intelligence software. Ultimately, while we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control, our goal is
a fully autonomously-driven future that improves safety and provides our customers with convenience and additional income
through participation in an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network. This network, which will also include our own fleet of vehicles,
will also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. Finally, our vehicles offer unparalleled in-
vehicle entertainment features, currently including Internet search, music services, passenger karaoke, and parked video streaming
and gaming.
13
 
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy Storage Systems
The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive. Established companies, such as AES Energy Storage,
Siemens, LG Chem and Samsung, as well as various emerging companies, have introduced products that are similar to our product
portfolio. There are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems (such as cells, battery modules,
and power electronics) as well as others providing integrated systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy
density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications of our products, our strong brand, and the modular, scalable nature of our
Powerpack and Megapack products give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products.
Solar Energy Systems
The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our
potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price, predictability of price and the
ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy
companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while
others only provide financing for these installations. In the residential solar energy system installation market, our primary
competitors include Vivint Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Trinity Solar, SunPower Corporation, and many smaller local solar companies.
The electricity produced by solar installations still represents a small fraction of total U.S. electricity generation. With tens
of millions of single-family homes and businesses in our primary service territories, and many more in other locations, we have a
large opportunity to expand and grow this business as we make our retrofit installations more accessible and ramp our innovative
Solar Roof. We also believe that residential solar energy generation is gaining favorable regulatory momentum, as exemplified in
part by the state of California recently requiring that new homes be built with solar generation starting in 2020.
Intellectual Property
We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness
to our product portfolio.  As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations
and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee
and third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining
patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs
within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have
also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our
patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made
this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting
ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world.  
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, Tesla, Inc. had 48,016 full-time employees. To date, we have not experienced any work
stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Available Information
We file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange

ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which
could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing
our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design,
manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our
manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We have previously experienced launch and production ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle
models such as Model S, Model X and Model 3, and new vehicle features such as the all-wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on
Model S and the second version of our Autopilot hardware. For example, we encountered unanticipated supply chain constraints
that led to initial delays in producing Model X and an isolated supplier limitation in the manufacture of Model 3. Similarly, during
our initial Model 3 production ramp, we had challenges ramping fully automated processes, such as portions of the battery module
assembly line, material flow system and the general assembly line, which we addressed by reducing the levels of automation and
introducing semi-automated or manual processes. In addition, we have used a number of new manufacturing technologies,
techniques and processes for our vehicles, such as aluminum spot welding systems and high-speed blow forming of certain difficult
to stamp vehicle parts, and we may introduce new processes in the future. We have also introduced unique design features in our
vehicles with different manufacturing challenges, such as large display screens, dual motor drivetrain, hardware for our Autopilot
and FSD features and falcon-wing doors. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale
any such new processes or features.
In particular, our future business depends in large part on the high-volume production of Model 3 and Model Y, which we
believe are our vehicles with the largest markets. We have limited experience to date in manufacturing Model 3 at high volumes
and continuously increasing its production rates, particularly across multiple vehicle manufacturing facilities, which we
commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019 with Gigafactory Shanghai coming online. In order to be successful, we will need to
implement, maintain and/or ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve
the design tolerances, high quality and maximum output rates we have planned, including at Gigafactory Shanghai, and for Model
Y, which we commenced manufacturing at the Fremont Factory in the first quarter of 2020. Bottlenecks such as those we have
experienced in the past with new product ramps and other unexpected challenges may also arise as we ramp production, and it will
be important that we address them promptly while continuing to reduce our manufacturing costs. If we are not successful in doing
so, or if we experience issues with our ongoing manufacturing process improvements and cost-down efforts, we could face delays
in establishing and/or sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.
Moreover, we will need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate high-volume production facilities to support
our vehicle ramp at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai, as well as at Gigafactory Nevada to support the manufacture of
battery packs and drive units for certain of our vehicles. Finally, because our vehicle models, in particular Model 3 and Model Y,
may share certain parts, suppliers or production facilities with each other, the volume or efficiency of production with respect to
one model may impact also the production of other models or lead to bottlenecks that impact the production of all models.  
We may also experience similar future delays or other complications in launching and/or ramping production of new
vehicles, such as Tesla Semi, Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster, our energy storage products and the Solar Roof, as well as
future features and services such as new Autopilot or FSD features and the autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network. Likewise, we
may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future
manufacturing facilities, including our planned Gigafactory Berlin in Germany.
15
 
Any significant delay or other complication in the production ramp of our current products or the development, manufacture,
launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, including complications associated with expanding our
production capacity and supply chain or obtaining or maintaining related regulatory approvals, or inability to manage such ramps
cost-effectively, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We may be unable to meet our growing product sales, delivery and installation plans and vehicle servicing and charging
network needs, or accurately project and manage this growth internationally, any of which could harm our business and
prospects.
Concurrent with developing, launching and ramping our products, our success will depend on our ability to continue to
significantly increase their sales, deliveries, installations and servicing worldwide, while allocating our available resources among
multiple products simultaneously. As we expand globally, we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory
requirements applicable to the sale, installation and service of our products, the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy
systems and operation of Superchargers in various jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. These plans require
significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will ultimately generate additional sales or
installations of our products.
We continuously evaluate, and as appropriate evolve, our retail operations and product offerings in order to maximize our
reach and optimize our costs, vehicle line-up and model differentiation, and purchasing experience. However, there is no guarantee
that each step in our evolving strategy will be perceived as intended by prospective customers accustomed to more traditional sales
models. In particular, we are targeting with Model 3 and Model Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential
customers, in which we have limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. Until we ramp local production at
Gigafactory Shanghai and in the future at Gigafactory Berlin, we will have to contend with predominantly single-factory vehicle
production at the Fremont Factory for numerous international variants. If our specific demand expectations for these variants prove
inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or
that are commensurate with our operations in a given region, which may negatively impact our deliveries and operating results in a
particular period. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy storage product and solar business worldwide, our success will
depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand for our products in different markets.
Moreover, because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our
customers and meeting their vehicle servicing needs. While we have substantially implemented and improved many aspects of our
delivery and service operations, we still have relatively limited experience with, and may face difficulties in, such deliveries and
servicing at high volumes, particularly in international markets as we expand. For example, significant transit time may be required
to transport vehicles in volume into international markets, and we also saw challenges in initially ramping our logistical channels in
China and Europe as we delivered Model 3 there for the first time in the first quarter of 2019. To accommodate growing volumes,
we have deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces, some of which have not
been previously tested at scale and in different geographies and may not ultimately be successful. Likewise, because of our unique
expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by our service centers, Mobile Service technicians or
certain authorized professionals that we have specifically trained and equipped. If we experience delays in adding such servicing
capacity or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particular higher-volume and newer additions to our
fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Finally, the increasing
number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors
throughout the world.
We are also expanding our installation capabilities for the Solar Roof as we continue its manufacturing ramp by training both
our own personnel and third party installers. If we are not successful in growing this overall installation capability to keep pace with
our increasing production, or if we experience unforeseen delays in the production ramp or inaccurately forecast demand for the Solar
Roof, our operating results may be negatively impacted.
16
 
There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, servicing, charging and
installation targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate, or that the pace of growth or
coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. Moreover, we may not be successful in
undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs, adapt our products
and conduct our operations to meet local requirements and regulations, implement required local infrastructure, systems and
processes, and find and hire a significant number of additional sales, service, electrical installation, construction and administrative
personnel. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our
vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.
Our growth is highly dependent upon the worldwide adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and
electric vehicles in particular. Although we have successfully grown demand for our vehicles thus far, there is no guarantee of such
future demand, or that our vehicles will not compete with one another in the market. Moreover, the target demographics for our
vehicles, in particular the mass market demographic for Model 3 and Model Y, are highly competitive. If the market for electric
vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if
demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be
harmed.
We have only relatively recently achieved high-volume production of vehicles, and are still at an earlier stage and have
limited resources relative to our competitors. Moreover, the market for alternative fuel vehicles is rapidly evolving. As a result, the
market for our vehicles could be affected by numerous factors, such as:
 • perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;
 • perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;
 • competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-
economy internal combustion engine vehicles;
 • volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;
 • government regulations and economic incentives;
 • access to charging facilities; and
 • concerns about our future viability.
In addition, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to
increased volatility, especially as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies. Specifically, it is uncertain as to how
such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an
industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales.
17
 
We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single-source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers
to deliver necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices, quality levels and volumes
acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components, could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and operating results.
Our products contain thousands of purchased parts that we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers.  We attempt to
mitigate our supply chain risk by entering into long-term agreements where it is practical and beneficial to do so, including
agreements we entered into with Panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier; qualifying and obtaining components
from multiple sources where sensible, such as the PV panels for our retrofit solar installations that we purchase from a variety of
suppliers; and maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead
times. However, our limited, and in most cases single-source, supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery
failure or component shortages for our production, such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our
slower-than-planned Model S and Model X ramps. Furthermore, unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing,
labor issues, wars, governmental changes, tariffs, natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan, health epidemics,
and other factors beyond our and our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a
timely basis. The loss of any supplier, particularly a single- or limited-source supplier, or the disruption in the supply of
components from our suppliers, could lead to product design changes, production delays of key revenue-generating products, idle
manufacturing facilities, and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing, servicing and supporting our
products, any of which could result in negative publicity, damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We may also be impacted by changes in our supply chain or production needs. We have experienced in the past, and may
experience in the future, cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines
as well as due to our design changes. Likewise, any significant increases in our production, such as for Model 3 and our
expectations for Model Y, has required and/or may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of
time. Our suppliers may not ultimately be able to sustainably and timely meet our cost, quality and volume needs, requiring us to
replace them with other sources. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most
of our components in a relatively short time frame, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own
replacements for certain highly customized components. Additionally, we continuously negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain
cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, seek new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempt to
redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier
costs, our operating results will suffer.
Outside of the U.S., we have limited manufacturing experience and we may experience issues or delays increasing the level
of localized procurement at our Gigafactory Shanghai and in the future at our Gigafactory Berlin. Furthermore, as the scale of our
vehicle production increases, we will need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components to our
manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally and at much higher volumes. If we are unable to accurately match
the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory
management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain, we may incur unexpected
production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and operating results.
Any problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory Nevada or ramping and maintaining operations there could negatively
affect the production and profitability of our products, such as Model 3, Model Y and our energy storage products. In
addition, the battery cells produced there store large amounts of energy.
To lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume, we have vertically integrated the production of
lithium-ion cells at Gigafactory Nevada, where we also manufacture battery packs and drive units for certain vehicles and energy
storage products and assemble our Megapack product. Production of lithium-ion cells at Gigafactory Nevada began in 2017, and
we have no other direct experience in the production of lithium-ion cells. Given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is
possible that future events could result in issues or delays in further ramping our products and expanding production output at
Gigafactory Nevada.
18
 
In order to achieve our volume and gross margin targets for our vehicles and energy storage products, we must continue to
sustain and ramp significant cell production at Gigafactory Nevada, which, among other things, requires Panasonic to successfully
operate and further ramp its cell production lines at significant volumes. Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing
high-quality cells at significant volume at its factories in Japan, it has relatively limited experience with cell production at
Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we produce several components for Model 3 and Model Y, such as battery modules incorporating
the lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic and drive units (including to support Gigafactory Shanghai production), at Gigafactory
Nevada. Some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity. While we
have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying multiple semi-automated lines and improving our original lines, additional
bottlenecks may arise as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. If we are unable to maintain
Gigafactory Nevada production, ramp output additionally over time as needed, and do so cost-effectively, or if we or Panasonic are
unable to hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel, our ability to supply battery packs or other components
for Model 3, Model Y and our other products could be negatively impacted, which could negatively affect our brand and harm our
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
In addition, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are
stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such
facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety
issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such disruptions or issues could negatively affect our brand and
harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory
Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could
adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.
As part of our continuing work to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, and in order to make them
affordable in international markets by accessing local supply chains and workforces, we have established Gigafactory Shanghai in
China. Currently, we have installed annual production capacity for 150,000 Model 3 vehicles there that we believe we will
eventually be able to push to actual rates of production in excess of such number, and we have commenced construction of the next
phase of Gigafactory Shanghai to add Model Y manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for Model 3. The ramp and further
expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including
ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, maintenance of operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion,
potential supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees, and the pace of bringing production
equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. We have limited experience to date
with operating manufacturing facilities abroad, and only recently began to sell Model 3 in China. If we experience any issues or
delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for Gigafactory Shanghai, or in
maintaining and complying with the terms of local debt financing that we intend will largely fund it, or in generating and
maintaining demand locally for the vehicles we manufacture at Gigafactory Shanghai, our business, prospects, operating results and
financial condition could be adversely impacted.
In particular, local manufacturing is critical to our expansion and sales in China, which is the largest market for electric
vehicles in the world. Our vehicle sales in China have been negatively impacted in the past by certain tariffs on automobiles
manufactured in the U.S., such as our vehicles, and our costs for producing our vehicles in the U.S. have also been affected by
import duties on certain components sourced from China. If we are not able to successfully and timely ramp Gigafactory Shanghai,
we may continue to be exposed to the impact of such unfavorable tariffs, duties or costs to our detriment compared to locally-based
competitors.
19
 
We face risks associated with our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political,
economic, tax and labor conditions, and with establishing ourselves in new markets, all of which could harm our
business.
We have a global footprint with domestic and international operations and subsidiaries. Accordingly, we are subject to a
variety of legal, political and regulatory requirements and social, environmental and economic conditions over which we have little
control. For example, we may be impacted by trade policies, environmental conditions, political uncertainty and economic cycles
involving geographic regions where we have significant operations, which are inherently unpredictable. We are subject to a number
of risks associated in particular with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our
products and require significant management attention. These risks include conforming our products to various international
regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures, organizing local operating entities,
difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations, challenges in attracting customers, foreign government taxes,
regulations and permit requirements, our ability to enforce our contractual rights, trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and
price or exchange controls, and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products.
Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of materials, in particular for lithium-ion cells, could harm our
business.
We may experience increases in the cost of or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials. Any such
increase, supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and
operating results. We use various materials in our business including aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper and cobalt, as well as
lithium-ion cells from suppliers. The prices for these materials fluctuate, and their available supply may be unstable, depending on
market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and
energy storage products by our competitors, and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are
exposed to multiple risks relating to lithium-ion cells. These risks include:
 • an increase in the cost, or decrease in the available supply, of materials used in the cells;
 • disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers or any issues that may
arise with respect to cells manufactured at our own facilities; and
 • fluctuations in the value of any foreign currencies in which battery cell and related raw material purchases are or may
be denominated, such as the Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar. 
Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy
storage products. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, and expect to eventually
rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities, we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of
suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the
supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for energy
products until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other
economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs. Substantial increases in
the prices for our materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by battery cell suppliers, would increase our operating
costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Any attempts to
increase product prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations of orders and reservations and therefore
materially and adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating results.
20
 
If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell
our products and services could be harmed.
If our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected
or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become
enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and
services could be harmed. For example, the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex
and may contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by vehicle customers have included
those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, as well as the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S and
the seats and doors in the Model X. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and
rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of our customers.
While we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture, we currently have a limited frame of reference
by which to evaluate detailed long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs,
powertrains, vehicles and energy storage products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in
our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers.
Any product defects, delays or legal restrictions on product features, or other failure of our products to perform as expected,
could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, breach of warranty claims, and
significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating
results and prospects.
We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not
able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.
Although we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road, product liability claims, even those without merit,
could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry in particular experiences
significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are
claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the
future will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury, and such crashes where Autopilot or FSD features are
engaged are the subject of significant public attention. We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from
or related to misuse or claimed failures of new technologies that we are pioneering, including Autopilot and FSD features in our
vehicles. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can
rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other
lithium-ion cells. While we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without
spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we
produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash, which could subject us to lawsuits, product recalls or redesign
efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive.
Moreover, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to
cause injury to people or property. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary
award. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy storage
products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate
substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business,
prospects and operating results. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle
exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds, not by insurance.
21
 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries.
We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face
competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.
The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it
will become even more so in the future. There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in
which they compete. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other
companies, have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid
and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and applications. In some cases, such competitors have
announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Most of our current and potential
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, vehicle sales resources and networks than we
do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and
support of their products.  In particular, some competitors have also announced plans to compete with us in important and large
markets for electric vehicles, such as China and in Europe. Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales, price
reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. In addition, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile
manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV market, including BMW, Ford, Lexus,
Mercedes and Volkswagen Group.
The solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive. We face competition from other manufacturers, developers
and installers of solar and energy storage systems, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from
utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of
customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs. Moreover, prices for solar product components and prices per
kWh for lithium-ion battery cells have declined and may continue to decline, which may adversely impact our ability to cost-
effectively manufacture such components ourselves.
If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts
and within our industries, or are subject to negative publicity, then our financial condition, operating results, business
prospects and access to capital may suffer materially.
Consumers may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our
service and support and other operations will continue in the long term. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less
likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will
succeed. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers,
analysts, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence
may be particularly complicated by certain factors including those that are largely outside of our control, such as our limited
operating history, customer unfamiliarity with our products, any delays in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to
meet demand, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services, and our
quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations.
In particular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are well-publicized by a range of third
parties. Such attention includes frequent criticism, which is often exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the
sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, could harm our
business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.
22
 
If we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual, financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing
programs, our business may suffer.
We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial
institutions. We also currently offer leasing directly through our local subsidiaries for Model S, Model X and Model 3 in the U.S.
and for Model S and Model X in Canada. Under a lease held directly by us, we typically receive only a very small portion of the
total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. The profitability of
any vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the
outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and
demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. For example, we made certain adjustments to our
vehicle prices during 2019 to reflect anticipated changes to our cost structure from periodically optimizing our retail strategy, and
as a limited accommodation to customers in consideration of a reduction in the electric vehicle federal tax credit. Such pricing
changes may impact the residual values of our vehicles. The leasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing
and/or business partners to fund and grow this program, and screen for and manage customer credit risk. We expect the availability
of leasing and other financing options will be important for our vehicle customers. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing
program with internal funds, or partners or other external financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not
available for our customers, we may be unable to grow our deliveries. Furthermore, if our leasing business grows substantially, our
business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if
we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer
protection laws governing lease transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties, either of which may
harm our business.
Moreover, we have provided resale value guarantees to customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which
such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale
values, as with residual values for leased vehicles, are subject to similar fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements,
such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us
pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our operating results,
profitability and/or liquidity could be negatively impacted.
The unavailability, reduction or elimination of, or unfavorable determinations with respect to, government and economic
incentives in the U.S. and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles, energy storage products
or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services.
We and our customers currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and
adoption of electric vehicles. In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of
electric vehicles. Specific policies in place around the world include exempting the purchase of electric vehicles from import taxes,
value added taxes, or carbon dioxide and weight-based purchase taxes. Such programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted.
For example, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit that was available in the U.S. for the purchase of our vehicles
was reduced in phases during 2019 and ended on December 31, 2019. We believe that this sequential phase-out likely pulled
forward some vehicle demand into the periods preceding each reduction. Moreover, in July 2018, a previously available incentive
for purchases of Model 3 in Ontario, Canada was cancelled and Tesla buyers in Germany lost access to electric vehicle incentives
for a short period of time beginning late 2017. In April 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available incentives in
Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Effective March 2016,
California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers.
Such developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to
them.
23
 
In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect
to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and
investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date when the allocated
funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning. For example,
the U.S. federal government currently offers an investment tax credit (ITC) for the installation of solar power facilities and energy
storage systems that are charged from a co-sited solar power facility; however, the ITC is currently scheduled to decline in phases,
from 26% for qualifying solar systems for which construction began by December 31, 2020, to 10% for commercial and utility
systems and to 0% for customer-owned residential systems for which construction begins after December 31, 2021. Likewise, in
jurisdictions where net energy metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their
solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. Several jurisdictions have reduced,
altered or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering, or have proposed to do so. Such reductions in or termination
of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by making our products less competitive for potential customers,
increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for
our solar and energy storage assets.
Moreover, we and our fund investors claim the ITC and certain state incentives in amounts based on the fair market value of
our solar and energy storage systems. Although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values, the
relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower, and
they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make
indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.
Any failure by us to comply with the terms of our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of
New York relating to our Gigafactory New York, could result in negative consequences for our business.
We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the SUNY Foundation. These
agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory in Buffalo, New York, which we have primarily used for the
development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components, and
Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things,
directly employ specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined
capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning
April 30, 2018. While we expect significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area to continue,
including with our ramp and manufacture of the Solar Roof, if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to
meet these obligations, we would be obligated to pay a “program payment” of $41.2 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year.
Any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the
SUNY Foundation, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations, in
particular our production ramp of the Solar Roof or Supercharger components. Any of the foregoing events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
If we are unable to attract and/or retain key employees and hire qualified personnel, our ability to compete could be
harmed.
The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of
our vehicles and services, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results. In particular, we are highly
dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.
None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to
successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to
attract and retain executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel,
especially to support our high-volume manufacture of vehicles, expansion plans and technological innovation, and any failure or
delay in doing so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
24
 
Key talent may leave Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with
automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In California, Nevada and other regions where we
have operations, including outside of the U.S., there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business,
including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, software engineering, manufacturing engineering, and other skills such as
electrical and building construction expertise. This competition affects our ability to retain and hire key employees. Moreover, we
have in the past conducted reductions in force in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs, and certain senior
personnel have also departed for various reasons. Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees
in a timely manner, especially to support our expansion plans, and to retain current employees or replace departed senior employees
with qualified and experienced individuals, which is typically a time-consuming process. Additionally, we compete with both
mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that
promise short-term growth opportunities. Difficulties in retaining or recruiting employees could have an adverse effect on our
performance and results.
Finally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based
awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We have to
periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards that may be granted and
shares that may be purchased under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite
stockholder approvals to obtain future increases to the number of awards that may be granted and shares that may be purchased
under such plans, and compensate our personnel in accordance with our compensation philosophy, our ability to retain and hire
qualified personnel would be negatively impacted.
We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.
We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder. Although Mr.
Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to
Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies
Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.
We are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed
to protect our systems against breaches and cyber-attacks. If these efforts are not successful, our business and operations
could be disrupted or our intellectual property could be compromised, as a result of which our operating results and
reputation could be harmed.
We are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems, including implementing new internally
developed systems and deploying such systems globally, to assist us in the management of our business. In particular, our volume
production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development, maintenance and improvement of our information technology
systems in the U.S. and abroad, including at Gigafactory Shanghai, such as systems for product data management, procurement,
inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and
regulatory compliance systems. We also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual
property theft, data breaches and other cyber-attacks. The implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these
systems require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing,
improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including the
disruption of our data management, procurement, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes.
These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and
service vehicles, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits
under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.
25
 
We cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded
as planned. If we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted,
our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal
control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information
or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or
their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or
find alternative sources for performing these functions.
Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our
products and harm our business.
Our products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are
designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their
functionality. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our
information technology networks, our products and their systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in
the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to
change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated
by our products. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products via our security vulnerability
reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. Accordingly, we have received reports of potential
vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them. However, there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be
exploited in the future before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.
Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or
proceedings. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well
as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being “hacked,” could
negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have been the subject of
such reports in the past.
We are subject to substantial laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable
changes upon our operations or products, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including as they
evolve, could negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities and substantially harm our business
and operating results.
As a manufacturing company, including with respect to our current facilities such as the Fremont Factory,
Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York and Gigafactory Shanghai and our future facility at Gigafactory Berlin, we are or will
be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the
U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and
human exposure to hazardous materials and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. The costs of
compliance, including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by
new or amended laws, may be significant. We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such
laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities, which would hinder our operation of these facilities. Such costs and delays
may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results. Furthermore, any violations of these laws may result in
substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, third party damages, or a suspension or cessation of our operations.
26
 
In addition, motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state and local laws. We incur
significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to
such regulations, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. We are subject to laws and
regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale and service of automobiles internationally. For example, in countries
outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions, among other things,
that are often materially different from requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and
systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries. This process may include official review and certification of our
vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management
systems requirements.
In particular, we offer in our vehicles Autopilot and FSD features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and
potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain engaged. We are continuing to develop
our FSD technology with the goal of achieving full self-driving capability in the future. There is a variety of international, federal
and state regulations that may apply to self-driving vehicles, which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally
intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the
likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay products or restrict self-driving features and
availability, any of which could adversely affect our business.
Finally, as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated
and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, we are impacted by federal, state and local
regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the
electric grid, and the sale of electricity generated by third-party owned systems. For example, existing or proposed regulations and
policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems, charge
fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid, adjust electricity rate designs such
that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid, restrict us and our customers from
transacting under our PPAs or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power, and limit or eliminate
net energy metering. If such regulations and policies are adopted, or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the
interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced, they could deter potential customers from purchasing
our solar and energy storage products, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy
storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.
Failure to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws to which we are subject
could harm the Company.
Our privacy policy is posted on our website, and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it
or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the collection, use, retention,
security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal
liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may
be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still
subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application. For example, in May 2018, the General Data
Protection Regulation began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the
European Union, and has created new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Similarly,
beginning in January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of
personal information related to California residents. Although we take steps to protect the security and integrity of our customers’
personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties
improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to
customers’ personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our
business and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm
to our reputation and brand.
27
 
Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.
It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as us to belong to a union, which can result in higher
employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate
employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with
respect to the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our
employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union
signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such
unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board, and they may do so in the
future. In September 2019, an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and against us on
certain others. The National Labor Relations Board has not yet adopted the recommendation and we have appealed certain aspects
of the recommended decision. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s
treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such
as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the
manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial
condition.
We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions, which could adversely affect
our brand image and financial performance.
Any product recall with respect to our products may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our
business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. For example, certain vehicle recalls that we initiated have resulted
from various causes, including a component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged, a concern with the
firmware in the restraints control module in certain right-hand-drive vehicles, industry-wide issues with airbags from a particular
supplier, Model X seat components that could cause unintended seat movement during a collision, and concerns of corrosion in
Model S and Model X power steering assist motor bolts. Furthermore, testing of our products by government regulators or industry
groups may require us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products. In the
future, we may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle
powertrain components that we have provided to other vehicle OEMs, including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers,
prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such
recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers,
could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely
affect our financial performance.
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles and production powertrain components and
systems we sell.  In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage
systems we sell, and we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers’ warranties. Finally, we offer a
performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does
not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their PPA or lease.  Under these performance guarantees, we bear the risk
of electricity production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure.  These risks are exacerbated in the event the panel or
inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.
If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Warranty reserves include our management’s best
estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to
date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our
historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products such as Model 3, Model Y and the Solar Roof that we have
recently introduced and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material
changes to our warranty reserves in the future.
28
 
Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.
We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and
other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance
coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have
may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be
sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to
pay substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other
factors.
We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as
the pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our
current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our
revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop
and introduce new products.  As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results,
especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future
performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors,
who may be focused only on quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially,
either suddenly or over time.
Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient
cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness.
As of December 31, 2019, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $12.49 billion in aggregate principal amount of
indebtedness (see Note 12, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry
conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur
additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.
Pursuant to their terms, holders of our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due
2022 and 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (together, the “Tesla Convertible Notes”) may convert their respective Tesla
Convertible Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective Tesla Convertible Notes under certain
circumstances. Upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes, we will be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares in
respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such Tesla Convertible
Notes. Moreover, our subsidiary’s Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “Subsidiary Convertible Notes”) are
convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $300.00 per share. Finally, holders of the Tesla Convertible
Notes and the Subsidiary Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a
fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date.
29
 
Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments
upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes, or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or
desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our
control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations
under our existing indebtedness, and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are
unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments
or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly
dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at
such time. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our
future indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all,
which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
The terms of certain of our credit facilities, including the Credit Agreement, contain, and any of our other future debt
agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to,
among other things, incur additional debt or issue guarantees, create liens, repurchase stock or make other restricted payments, and
make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a
fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions
and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our
failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to
accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.
We may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we
cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.
The design, manufacture, sale, installation and/or servicing of automobiles, energy storage products and solar products is a
capital-intensive business, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period.
Until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows, we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of
equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal
sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles, energy storage products and/or solar
products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our
significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We need sufficient capital to
fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new products, establishment and/or increases of Model 3 and
Model Y production capacity at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory Shanghai, the continued expansion of Gigafactory Nevada,
the construction of Gigafactory Berlin, the manufacturing ramp of the Solar Roof at Gigafactory New York, and the continued
expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network. We cannot be certain that
additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we
need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
30
 
We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain
governmental investigations and proceedings.
We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government
agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or
impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other
restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the DOJ, or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in
the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in
defending against any governmental proceedings.
For example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment
approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC
relating to Mr. Musk’s statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we,
among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the Chair of the Board, appointed two
additional independent directors to our board of directors, and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other
corporate governance-related matters. On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previously-agreed
disclosure procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed
without modification. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack
of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against
us.
If we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected, we may have to shorten
the useful lives of any equipment to be retired as a result of any such update, and the resulting acceleration in our
depreciation could negatively affect our financial results.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling, machinery and
other manufacturing equipment for our various product lines, and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected
useful lives. However, manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly, and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with
cutting-edge equipment more quickly than expected. Moreover, we are continually implementing learnings as our engineering and
manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase, which may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our
currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, our learnings
may cause us to discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of
any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to be
accelerated, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial results.
We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue
and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar,
Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any
strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced.
In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign
currencies, including the Japanese yen. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S.
dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will
correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. Moreover, while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset
the impact of currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact. As a result, our operating results
could be adversely affected.
31
 
We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our
ability to sell our electric vehicles.
We sell our vehicles directly to consumers using means that we believe will maximize our reach, currently including through
our website and our own stores. While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, we may not be able to
sell our vehicles through our own stores in each state in the U.S., as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose
limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. In some states, we have also opened galleries to educate and inform customers
about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. The application of these state laws to our
operations continues to be difficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state
motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so.
In addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to
whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and
such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. In some
states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent
us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our
ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate.
Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we
have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this
area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles
interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.
We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and
could cause us to incur substantial costs.
Others, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could
prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it
more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their
rights and urge us to take licenses, and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights. While we
endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic
initiatives, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that
are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors. Accordingly, we may
consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses
can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly
increase our operating expenses. In addition, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have
infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain
components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to
redesign our products and services, and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event
that we were required to take one or more such actions, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative
publicity and diversion of resources and management attention.
32
 
Our facilities or operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or
health epidemics.
We may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics or other events outside of our control. For example, our
corporate headquarters, the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern
California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. If major disasters such as earthquakes,
floods or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our
headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our
products. In addition, beginning in late 2019, the media has reported a public health epidemic originating in China, prompting
precautionary government-imposed closures of certain travel and business. Gigafactory Shanghai was closed for a brief time as a
result, before it reopened in February 2020 and rejoined our U.S. factories, which had continued to operate.  It is unknown whether
and how global supply chains, particularly for automotive parts, may be affected if such an epidemic persists for an extended period
of time. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse
impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock
The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.
The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in
response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of
$968.99 per share and a low of $176.99 per share over the last 52 weeks. The stock market in general, and the market for
technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been
and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further
influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the
stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating
performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular
company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Moreover, stockholder
litigation like this has been filed against us in the past. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any
future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.
We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our
stock price to decline.
We may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, which may include
projections regarding sales and production, as well as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows.
Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and
our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new
product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and
sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs, and
planned cost reductions. If our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or
the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our
common stock could decline significantly.
33
 
Transactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may
otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
The conversion of some or all of the Tesla Convertible Notes or the Subsidiary Convertible Notes would dilute the
ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes. Our Subsidiary
Convertible Notes have been historically, and the other Tesla Convertible Notes may become in the future, convertible at the option
of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. If holders elect to convert their convertible notes, we
could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the
common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the
existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be
used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of
our common stock.
Moreover, in connection with each issuance of the Tesla Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge
transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in
excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes. We also entered into warrant
transactions with the hedge counterparties, which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the
market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates.
In addition, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions,
which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes.
Elon Musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings. If Mr. Musk were forced to sell
these shares in order to satisfy his loan obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.
Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which
was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to
third party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges
of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline
substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his
loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline
further.
Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair
a takeover attempt.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to
the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain
business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a
fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying
or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our
common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, the following matters are being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because they relate to
environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties could potentially exceed $100,000.
The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (the “BAAQMD”) has issued notices of violation to us relating to air
permitting for the Fremont Factory, but has not initiated formal proceedings. We dispute certain of these allegations and are
working to resolve them with the BAAQMD. Further, we assert that there has been no related adverse community or environmental
impact. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, including the final amount of any penalties, it is not expected to have a
material adverse impact on our business.
We have also received an information request from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) under Section
114(a) of the Clean Air Act of 1963, as amended (the “Clean Air Act”). The EPA is reviewing the compliance of our Fremont
Factory operations with applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act, and we are working with the EPA in responding to this
request. While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse
impact on our business.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and
the results of operations for fiscal year 2017-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018, which was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 19, 2019.
Overview and 2019 Highlights
Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell
high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance,
installation, operation and other services related to our products.
Automotive
During 2019, we achieved annual vehicle delivery and production records of 367,656 and 365,232 total vehicles,
respectively. We also laid the groundwork for our next phase of growth with the commencement of Model 3 production at
Gigafactory Shanghai; preparations at the Fremont Factory for Model Y production, which commenced in the first quarter of 2020;
the selection of Berlin, Germany as the site for our next factory for the European market; and the unveiling of Cybertruck. We also
continued to enhance our user experience through improved Autopilot and FSD features, including the introduction of a new
powerful on-board FSD computer and a new Smart Summon feature, and the expansion of a unique set of in-car entertainment
options.
Energy Generation and Storage
We revamped key aspects of our solar operations in 2019 by streamlining traditionally complex ordering, permitting,
installation and back-end service processes to enhance the customer experience, especially for retrofit solar installations. Our solar
deployments grew approximately 48% and 26%, quarter-over-quarter, in the second half of the year. We also deployed 1.65 GWh
of energy storage in 2019, more than the aggregate of all prior years. Finally, we further evolved our product offerings by launching
the third generation of the Solar Roof, for which we are expanding both our manufacturing and installation capabilities, and
Megapack, our largest utility-scale energy storage product to date.
Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2020 Outlook
Automotive—Production
A key focus in 2020 will be our efforts towards establishing and expanding capacity for vehicle production at volume across
three continents. At the Fremont Factory, we commenced Model Y production earlier than anticipated, and combined with Model 3,
we have installed annual production capacity for 400,000 vehicles. We expect to further increase this capacity to 500,000 vehicles
through the installation of additional equipment.
At Gigafactory Shanghai, we have installed annual production capacity for 150,000 Model 3 vehicles that we believe we
will eventually be able to push to actual rates of production in excess of such number, subject to local production of battery packs,
which we began ramping there later than other processes. We have commenced construction of the next phase of Gigafactory
Shanghai to add Model Y manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for Model 3. To finance our construction and
expansion, in December 2019 our local subsidiary entered into a RMB 9.0 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) fixed
asset term facility and a RMB 2.25 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) working capital revolving facility, part of
which was used to repay a RMB 3.5 billion bridge loan entered into in March 2019. We are supplementing such financing with
limited direct capital expenditures.
39
 
Finally, we have selected Germany as the site of our next factory for manufacturing vehicles for the European market, due to
its strong manufacturing and engineering presence. However, the construction of and ramp at Gigafactory Berlin, as well as at
Gigafactory Shanghai, are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing
compliance with regulatory requirements, maintenance of operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, potential
supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees, and the pace of bringing production equipment and
processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. Ultimately, achieving increased total vehicle
production cost-effectively across all of our manufacturing operations will require that we timely address any bottlenecks that may
arise as we ramp, establish and maintain sustained supplier capacity, and successfully utilize manufacturing processes at the
maximum output rates that we have planned for them.
Automotive—Demand and Sales
As the automotive industry continues to validate and grow the market for electric vehicles, we are generating demand and
new customers even without traditional marketing and with relatively low marketing costs, and in 2019 our orders shifted to
originating mostly from new customers without prior reservations. Production at Gigafactory Shanghai allows us to offer Model 3
in China at competitive local pricing and more quickly, which should drive further demand and opportunity in the world’s largest
market for mid-sized premium sedans, and we expect a similar impact in China for Model Y when we commence production there
of this offering in the popular compact SUV segment.
Moreover, the significant interest generated by our unveiling of Cybertruck demonstrated our brand visibility, innovation
and viability across an increasing range of vehicle segments. Meanwhile, we are making our existing vehicles incrementally more
compelling, including through a planned software update for FSD-enabled vehicles to react to traffic lights and stop signs and
navigate city intersections, and additional functionality of both in-vehicle software and the Tesla mobile app.
 
On the other hand, we may be impacted by trade and environmental policies, political uncertainty and economic cycles
involving geographic regions where we have significant operations, which are inherently unpredictable. Sales of vehicles in the
automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility. Specifically, it is
uncertain as to how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing
market share in an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales. Finally, we make certain adjustments to
our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including as we introduce new vehicles and variants and optimize
the pricing among them. Such pricing changes may impact our vehicles’ resale values, and in turn our operating results. For
example, if price reductions result in an increase to our estimates of the volume of vehicles that may potentially be returned to us
under pre-existing resale value guarantees provided to customers and partners for certain financing programs, our gross profits may
be reduced.
Automotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure
 
We continue to optimize our manufacturing and global delivery patterns to address higher volumes of our predominantly
single-factory production at the Fremont Factory. We expect to alleviate any related issues through local production at Gigafactory
Shanghai and eventually at Gigafactory Berlin.
We also continue to expand and invest in our servicing and charging locations and capabilities to keep pace with our
customer vehicle fleet and ensure a convenient and efficient customer experience. However, if our customer vehicles, particularly
in the rapidly growing Model 3 fleet, experience unexpected reliability issues, it could outpace and overburden our servicing
capabilities and parts inventory.
Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment
 
We expect to continue to grow our retrofit solar system deployments as we execute our new strategy, including through
compelling financing options such as a subscription-based offering, which is currently available in California.
40
 
We are focused on training our personnel and third party partners to ramp installations of our Solar Roof, and are also hiring
rapidly for its ongoing manufacturing ramp at Gigafactory New York. We expect such ramp will support our significant operations
and our compliance with minimum hiring and cumulative investment targets under our agreement with the SUNY Foundation
related to the construction and use of Gigafactory New York. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our
investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses
or substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation.
Finally, with the introduction of our 3 MWh Megapack, we now offer an even greater variety of scalable energy storage
products with a wide range of markets and applications, and expect this product to drive additional interest from global project
developers and utilities.    
Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses
Our capital expenditures are difficult to project beyond the short term, given the number and breadth of our core projects at
any given time. For example, the curve of any new product ramp, such as for Model Y and the Solar Roof, is inherently subject to
uncertainty of timing, and if we are able to meet various milestones along such ramp more quickly than expected, our capital
expenditures may be accelerated. We also continuously evaluate, and as appropriate adjust, our capital expenditures based on,
among other things: our manufacturing plans for our various products, which we may rebalance from time to time based on the mix
of demand among them and other contingent factors; the pace and prioritization of current projects under development; and the
addition of any new projects. Moreover, we are generally increasing the capital efficiency of our projects with experience, and we
may find that our actual capital expenditures on new projects are different than previously expected.
Subject to the above, considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramps for our products, construction and
expansion of our factories, and pipeline of announced projects under development, and consistent with our current strategy of using
partners to manufacture battery cells, as well as considering all other infrastructure growth, we currently expect our average annual
capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to be $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion.
We expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future as we focus on increasing
operational efficiency and process automation, as well as from increases in expected overall revenues from our expanding sales. In
particular, our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business have already manifested in
total operating expenses decreasing from $4.4 billion to $4.1 billion from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019, including
restructuring and other charges. Meanwhile, our total revenues increased from $21.5 billion to $24.6 billion in the same period.
In March 2018, our stockholders approved the 2018 CEO Performance Award, with vesting contingent on achieving market
capitalization and operational milestones. We will incur significant non-cash stock-based compensation expense for each tranche
under this award after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met, and if later than the grant date, we
will also have to record a cumulative catch-up expense at such time. Such catch-up expense may be material depending on the
length of time elapsed from the grant date. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2019, as the result of an additional operational
milestone becoming probable of achievement, we recorded a cumulative catch-up expense of $72 million for service provided from
the grant date. Moreover, as the expense for a tranche is recorded over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period of the
relevant operational milestone and (ii) only if the related market capitalization milestone has not been achieved, its expected
achievement period, the achievement of a market capitalization milestone earlier than expected may accelerate the rate at which
such expense is recognized. Upon vesting of a tranche, all remaining associated expense will be recognized immediately. See Note
14, Equity Incentive Plans—2018 CEO Performance Award, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding the stock-based compensation relating to the 2018 CEO Performance
Award.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
(“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical
experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in
the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly
from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that
there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a
greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are
the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
Adoption of new revenue standard
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“new revenue standard”) using the
modified retrospective method. The new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. For
further discussion, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Automotive Segment
Automotive Sales Revenue
Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee
Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other
features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our
Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on
automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at
the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as
access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of
a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the
customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the
expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and FSD features is
recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone
selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other
information that may be available.
At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for
estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience. In addition, any fees that are paid
or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales
revenue.
Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are
not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features and over-
the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain
a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive
revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have
transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the
transaction price of automotive contracts.
42
 
Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option
We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and
who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in
connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales
price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period,
which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.
With the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section, we recognize revenue when
control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do
not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process
to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the
time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The
performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with
automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves
for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected
future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to
determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the
buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The two
programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners
with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option and Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where
Exercise is Probable.
Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating
leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was
exercised. For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC
840, Leases prior to January 1, 2019, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds
were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee
period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these
vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual
value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.
In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value
guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue,
and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the
vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value
guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net book value of the
vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory.
Automotive Regulatory Credits
In connection with the production and delivery of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will
continue to earn various tradable automotive regulatory credits. We have sold these credits, and will continue to sell future credits,
to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other
regulatory requirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted
California’s standard, vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV credits, for compliance
with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their
excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws. We also earn other types of saleable
regulatory credits in the United States and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuels credits. Payments for
regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is
transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.
43
 
Automotive Leasing Revenue
Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as
well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior to the adoption
of the new revenue standard, all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases.
Direct Vehicle Leasing Program
We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe.
As of December 31, 2019, the direct vehicle leasing program is offered for all new Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles in the
U.S. and new Model S and Model X vehicles in Canada. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla
for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X
leases, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating
leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record
the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue.
We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of referral fees and sales commissions from
the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently amortize these costs
over the term of the related lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of
automotive contracts.
Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option
We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales
in the United States. These transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing
partner. As control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions were
accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under
this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within
resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred
revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on
our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets,
and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease
arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease
(repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. With the
adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under ASC
842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows
for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the
buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any
remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end
customers can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle
after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue.
44
 
Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable
For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased
vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to
them, we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant
economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the
guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this
program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The
amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining
sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue.
The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost
of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to
cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.
In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee
liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net
book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during
the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any
remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated
balance sheets to used vehicle inventory.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Energy Generation and Storage Sales
Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to
residential, small commercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers, including solar subscription-based arrangements.
Upon adoption of ASC 842, energy generation and storage sales revenue includes agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs
that commence after January 1, 2019, as these are now accounted for under the new revenue standard. Sales of solar energy systems
to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system. Post-
installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays
historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy
system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a
solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring
service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy
storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and
revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation,
when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms
customary to the business.
For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the
engineering, design, and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific
phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost
incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated
labor hours for solar energy system sales. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage
system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and
are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility
grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is
recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy
storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and
maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery
of the service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in
advance.
45
 
In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the
various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated
based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential
installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated
balance sheets. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against
revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy
systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are
typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.
As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance
guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements
specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level.
Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be
required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar
energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy
market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are
estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional
performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a
significant reversal of revenue will not occur.
We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for
prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over
the respective customer contract term. 
Energy Generation and Storage Leasing
For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage
products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such
systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The
difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance
sheet.
For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have
determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based
on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of
revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer
contract term. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various
local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term.
We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the
referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term
of the related agreements.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and
energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is
recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are
written-off.
46
 
We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate
sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the
inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established
and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this
reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
Warranties
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and production powertrain components and systems we
sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we
sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best
estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on
actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently
uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause
material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated
with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these
warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is
included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of
operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees
and our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-
based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions and ESPP is estimated on the
grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such
as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant
judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The
resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,
usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based
compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.
For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance
achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone
becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance
and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the
expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related
market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone
is considered probable of being met. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will
recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is
achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-
based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may
accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. If additional operational milestones become probable, stock-based
compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catch-up expense for the service
provided since the grant date. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations.
47
 
As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our
common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation
of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based
compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative
expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
We are subject to federal and state taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our
net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that
are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic
or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many
countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of
December 31, 2019, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is
more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ
from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.
Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are
many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this
uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully
sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions,
which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit
by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our
consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and
interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a
tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs
from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The
eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax
assets in the period that such determination is made.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a
controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable interest
entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of
business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases
under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority
of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through
arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if
that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the
obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE
that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when
we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs. We evaluate
our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
48
 
Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain
funding arrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases.
We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further
determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest
balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at
book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling
interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated
balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV
method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet
represent the amounts the third-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of
the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and
with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of
operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest
balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital
transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to
the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section
of the consolidated balance sheet since these third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other
assets.

Automotive & Services and Other Segment
Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash sales of new Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles, including
access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot and FSD features and over-the-air software updates, as well as
sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.
Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles under direct
lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. We
began offering direct leasing for Model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019.
Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise,
sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue.
49
 
2019 Compared to 2018
Automotive sales revenue increased $2.32 billion, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase of 137,969 Model 3 cash deliveries from production scaling and an increase
of $175 million in sales of regulatory credits to $594 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 30,487 Model S and
Model X cash deliveries. The deliveries in the year ended December 31, 2019 were at lower average selling prices than the prior
year due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings and the introduction of lower end Model 3 trims in 2019. Due to the
price adjustments, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were
provided prior to such adjustments. As a result, along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product
returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under
our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $555 million. Refer to Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Automotive leasing revenue decreased $14 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee
leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative
vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program, partially due to the introduction of Model 3 direct leasing in the second quarter
of 2019.
Services and other revenue increased $835 million, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of trade-
in vehicles, partially offset by lower average selling prices for traded-in Tesla vehicles due to price adjustments we made to our
vehicle offerings in 2019. Additionally, there was an increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues
to grow.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products,
services related to such products, and sales of solar energy systems incentives.
2019 Compared to 2018
Energy generation and storage revenue decreased by $24 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreases in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs partially offset
increases in deployments of Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack.

Automotive & Services and Other Segment
Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including
depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and
infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales
revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it
exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.
Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as
well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and
allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.
Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs to
acquire and certify used vehicles, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other
revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired
subsidiaries to third party customers.
51
 
2019 Compared to 2018
Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $2.25 billion, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase of 137,969 Model 3 cash deliveries and higher average Model S and
Model X costs per unit compared to the prior year due to the discontinuation of lower end trims in 2019. The increases were
partially offset by a decrease of 30,487 Model S and Model X cash deliveries and a decrease in average Model 3 costs per unit
compared to the prior year primarily due to lower end trims introduced in 2019 and temporary under-utilization of manufacturing
capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018. Additionally, due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle
offerings in 2019, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were
provided prior to such adjustments. If customers elect to exercise the buyback options, we expect to be able to subsequently resell
the returned vehicles, which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of $451 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $29 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value
guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in
cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program, partially due to the introduction of Model 3 leasing in the second
quarter of 2019.
Cost of services and other revenue increased $890 million, or 47%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the costs of used vehicle sales from the increased volumes of
trade-in vehicles. Additionally, there were increases in the costs of our new service centers, additional service personnel in existing
and new service centers, Mobile Service capabilities, parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide
maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles.
Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 23% to 21% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower Model S and Model X margins from lower selling prices due to price
adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019, a higher proportion of Model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales
compared to the prior period. Additionally, the price adjustments also resulted in a reduction in gross automotive sales profit of
$104 million from the adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program. The
decrease was partially offset by improvement of Model 3 margins compared to the prior year as we achieved additional
manufacturing efficiencies in the production of Model 3 and an increase of $175 million in sales of regulatory credits.
Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 19% to 17% in the year ended December
31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above
and a higher proportion of services and other within the segment, which operates at lower gross margins than our automotive
business.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight,
warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In addition, where arrangements are
accounted for as operating leases, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy
systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.
2019 Compared to 2018
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue decreased by $24 million , or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in deployments of solar cash and
loan jobs, partially offset by increases in deployments of Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack.
52
 
Gross margin for energy generation and storage remained relatively consistent at 12% in the year ended December 31, 2019
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Energy storage gross margins improved in the current year as a result of lower
materials costs, partially offset by lower gross margins in our cash and loan solar business driven by higher costs from temporary
manufacturing under-utilization of our Solar Roof ramp.
Research and Development Expense
 
  Year Ended December 31,   2019 vs. 2018 Change  2018 vs. 2017 Change 
(Dollars in millions)  2019  2018  2017  $   %   $   %  
Research and development  $1,343  $1,460  $1,378  $(117)  -8% $ 82   6%
As a percentage of revenues   5%  7%  12%               
 
 
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and
research, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services
and amortized equipment expense.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 7% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales, as
well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation, our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost
structure relative to the size of our business.
R&D expenses decreased $117 million, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $95 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from cost
efficiency initiatives and a $26 million decrease in professional and outside service expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
 
  Year Ended December 31,   2019 vs. 2018 Change  2018 vs. 2017 Change 
(Dollars in millions)  2019  2018  2017  $   %   $   %  
Selling, general and administrative  $2,646  $2,835  $2,477  $(189)  -7% $ 358   14%
As a percentage of revenues   11%  13%  21%               
 
 
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our
stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for
professional and contract services and litigation settlements.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 13% to 11% in year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales, as
well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation, our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost
structure relative to the size of our business.
SG&A expenses decreased $189 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $302 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from
decreased headcount and cost efficiency initiatives, partially offset by a $112 million increase in stock-based compensation
expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award as we
recorded a $72 million cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided from the grant date when an additional operational
milestone was considered probable of being met in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, the expense period was shorter in the
prior year as it commenced upon the grant approval date of March 21, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve
efficiency. As a result, we recognized $50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and losses from
closing certain stores impacting both segments. We recognized $47 million in impairment related to the IPR&D intangible asset as
we abandoned further development efforts (refer to Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for details) and $15 million for the
related equipment within the energy generation and storage segment. We also incurred a loss of $37 million for closing operations
in certain facilities. On the statement of cash flows, the amounts were presented in the captions in which such amounts would have
been recorded absent the impairment charges. The employee termination expenses were substantially paid by December 31, 2019,
while the remaining amounts were non-cash.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we carried-out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve
efficiency and recognized $37 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a certain facility. The
employee termination cash expenses of $27 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were
non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $55 million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash)
from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, the shortening
of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of
the IPR&D asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13 million. We recognized
settlement and legal expenses of $30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-
private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018.
Interest Expense

Interest expense increased by $22 million, or 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness at relatively consistent
weighted average interest rates as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-
denominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. We expect
our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates.
54
 
Other income (expense), net, increased by $23 million, or 105%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, offset
by losses from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities year-over-year.

Our provision for income taxes increased by $52 million, or 90%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions year-over-year.

Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests changed unfavorably by
$174 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily
due to lower activities in our financing fund arrangements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2019, we had $6.27 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S.
dollar equivalent of $1.26 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollars. Our sources of cash are
predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems,
proceeds from debt facilities, proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings.
Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations, research and development projects for new
products, establishment and/or increases of Model 3 and Model Y production capacity at the Fremont Factory and at Gigafactory
Shanghai, the continued expansion of Gigafactory Nevada, the construction of Gigafactory Berlin, the manufacturing ramp of the
Solar Roof at Gigafactory New York, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service
fleet and Supercharger network.
As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2020 Outlook—Trends in
Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, considering the expected pace of
the manufacturing ramps for our products, construction and expansion of our factories, and pipeline of projects under development,
and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture battery cells, as well as considering all other
infrastructure growth, we currently expect our average annual capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to
be $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion.
55
 
We expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital
expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations, although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources. For
example, we expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will continue to be funded through indebtedness arranged
through local financial institutions in China, such as the RMB 9.0 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) fixed asset term
facility and RMB 2.25 billion (or the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars) working capital revolving facility that our local subsidiary
entered into in December 2019, and we expect the same with respect to Gigafactory Berlin. As always, we continually evaluate our
capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business, to further
strengthen our balance sheet, or for general corporate purposes.
We have an agreement to spend or incur $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other
costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production at Gigafactory New York. We anticipate meeting
these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New York, and we do not believe
that we face a significant risk of default.
We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will
provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months. A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth,
and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product
offerings, retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, and Supercharger network. We may need or want to raise
additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them, or at all. If we cannot raise
additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.
In addition, we had $3.03 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of
December 31, 2019, some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our
lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy
systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in financing funds or various other assets; and contributing or selling
qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases
into the financing funds). Upon the draw-down of any unused committed amounts, there are no restrictions on use of available
funds for general corporate purposes. For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds, refer to Note 12, Debt, and
Note 17, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.
Summary of Cash Flows
 
  Year Ended December 31,  
(Dollars in millions)  2019   2018   2017  
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities  $ 2,405  $ 2,098  $ (61)
Net cash used in investing activities  $ (1,436) $ (2,337) $ (4,196)
Net cash provided by financing activities  $ 1,529  $ 574
  $ 4,415
 
 
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our
business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital, especially
inventory, which includes vehicles in transit. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales, customer lease payments,
customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset
by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating
lease payments and interest payments on our financings.
56
 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $307 million to $2.41 billion during the year ended December 31,
2019 from $2.10 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018. This favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net
income, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $902 million, partially offset by the increase in net operating assets and
liabilities of $407 million and $188 million of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 which was
classified as an operating activity, as this represented an interest payment on the discounted convertible notes. The increase in net
operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2019 as
compared to 2018, as we were ramping for Model 3 production in 2018 and a larger increase in operating lease vehicles in 2019 as
compared to 2018 as we began offering Model 3 leasing in 2019. The increase in net operating assets and liabilities was partially
offset by a smaller increase in inventory and a larger increase in deferred revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which
were $1.33 billion during 2019, mainly for Gigafactory Shanghai construction, Model 3 production, and Model Y preparations, and
$2.10 billion during 2018, mainly for Model 3 production. Design, acquisition and installation of solar energy systems amounted to
$105 million and $218 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of $1.82 billion from the
issuance of the 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”), net of transaction costs, and $848 million from the
issuance of common stock, net of underwriting discounts, in registered public offerings, $736 million of net borrowings under loan
agreements entered into by certain Chinese subsidiaries, $394 million of net borrowings for automotive asset-backed notes, and
$174 million from the issuance of warrants in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes. These cash inflows were partially
offset by a $732 million portion of the repayment of our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 that was classified as
financing activity, a $566 million repayment of our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, a purchase of convertible note
hedges of $476 million in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, and collateralized lease repayments of $389 million. See
Note 12, Debt, and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings,
respectively.
Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of $1.18 billion of net
borrowings under automobile asset-backed notes, $431 million of net borrowings under the senior secured asset-based revolving
credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), $334 million from the issuance of solar asset-backed notes and $296 million of
proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances. These cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of
$582 million under our vehicle lease-backed loan and security agreements (the “Warehouse Agreements”), collateralized lease
repayments of $559 million, repayments of $230 million of the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2018, and
repayments of $210 million under the revolving aggregation credit facility.
57
 
Contractual Obligations
We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt
financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also
include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components and
services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts. The following table sets
forth, as of December 31, 2019, certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in millions):
 
 
      Year Ended December 31,      
  Total   2020   2021   2022   2023   2024   Thereafter 
Operating lease obligations,
   including imputed interest  $ 1,459  $ 296  $ 262  $ 210  $ 173  $ 146  $ 372 
Finance lease obligations,
   including imputed interest   1,795   474   478   600   225   5   13 
Purchase obligations (1)   16,292   5,729   2,946   3,645   3,948   24   — 
Debt, including scheduled
   interest (2)   14,031   1,774   2,594   2,287   1,993   2,575   2,808 
Total  $33,577  $ 8,273  $ 6,280  $ 6,742  $ 6,339  $ 2,750  $ 3,193
 
 
(1) These amounts represent (i) purchase orders of $2.50 billion issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all
vendors as of December 31, 2019 and (ii) $13.79 billion in other estimable purchase obligations pursuant to such
agreements, primarily relating to the purchase of lithium-ion cells produced by Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada, including
any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum purchase obligations. In cases
where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of December 31, 2019, we have
included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the relevant vendors as of such
date or, where applicable, on amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or reference.
In certain cases, such estimated amounts were subject to contingent events. Furthermore, these amounts do not include
future payments for purchase obligations that were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities as of December 31,
2019.
(2) Debt, including scheduled interest, includes our non-recourse indebtedness of $5.29 billion. Non-recourse debt refers to debt
that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. Short-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible
senior note conversion features, debt discounts and deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $375
million. Long-term scheduled interest payments and amortization of convertible senior note conversion features, debt
discounts and deferred financing costs for the years thereafter is $1.86 billion.
The table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $247 million because if recognized, they would be an adjustment to
our deferred tax assets.
We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase and finance their vehicles
through one of our specified commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners (refer to Automotive Sales with Resale Value
Guarantee or a Buyback Option in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The maximum amount we could be required to pay under these programs, should
customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options, would be $1.70 billion over the next five years, of which $226
million is within a 12-month period from December 31, 2019. We have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how
many customers will exercise their options. Additionally, we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore, the
actual exposure to us is deemed to be limited.
58
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-
balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of
revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian
dollar, Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign
subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates and, in particular, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may
in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge
foreign currency.
We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses)
on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local
currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). For the year ended December 31,
2019, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of $48 million in other (expense) income, net, with our largest re-measurement
exposures from the U.S. dollar, British pound and Canadian dollar as our subsidiaries are denominated in various local currencies.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of $2 million in other (expense) income, net,
with our largest re-measurement exposures from the euro, New Taiwan dollar and Canadian dollar.
We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that
adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes
were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance
sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income (loss) before income taxes. These changes
would have resulted in an adverse impact of $362 million at December 31, 2019 and $176 million at December 31, 2018 assuming
no foreign currency hedging.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management
policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments
for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in our interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest
expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 by $8 million and $9 million, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of redeemable noncontrolling
interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related
notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Changes in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in
2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in 2018.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
62
 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Automotive Sales To Customers With a Resale Value Guarantee or Buyback Option
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the sales return reserve related to resale value guarantees or
buyback options was $639 million as of December 31, 2019, of which $93 million was short-term. The Company offers some
customers resale value guarantees or buyback options. Under these programs, the Company receives full payment for the vehicle
sales price at the time of delivery and the customer has the option of selling their vehicle back to the Company during the guarantee
period for a pre-determined resale value. In circumstances where management does not believe the customer has a significant
economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option provided to them, the Company recognizes revenue
when control transfers upon delivery to a customer as a sale with a right of return. In circumstances where management believes the
customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option, the Company recognizes
the transaction as an operating lease. Management’s determination of whether there is a significant economic incentive includes
comparing and considering a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value.
Sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience plus estimates of expected future market values. On a quarterly
basis, management reassesses the estimated future market values of vehicles under these programs, taking into account price
adjustments on new vehicles and other changes in market value subsequent to the initial sale to determine the need for changes to
the reserve.  
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to automotive sales to customers with a
resale value guarantee or buyback option is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in
determining the sales return reserve when customers do not have a significant economic incentive to exercise their option. This in
turn led to high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating evidence in the sales
return reserve when customers do not have a significant economic incentive.  
63
 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
automotive revenue recognition for sales to customers with a resale value guarantee or buyback option as well as the related sales
return reserve, including controls over management’s estimate of expected future market values and historical experience. These
procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for determining whether customers have a significant
economic incentive to exercise their put rights under the resale value guarantee and buyback option programs and, if not, the related
sales return reserve. This included evaluating the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant
assumptions, including historical experience and the estimated expected future market values used in the comparison to guaranteed
resale amounts. Evaluating assumptions related to historical experience and estimated expected future market values involved
evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance and consistency with evidence
obtained in other areas of the audit. Procedures were performed to evaluate the reliability, completeness and relevance of
management’s data used in the development of the historical experience assumption.
Automotive Warranty Reserve
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive
segment, was $1,089 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used
Tesla vehicles. As described in Note 2, a warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management’s best
estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty, including recalls when identified. These estimates are
based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.  
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a
critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in determining the warranty reserve. This in turn led to
significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the estimate of the nature, frequency and
costs of future claims, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.  
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management’s estimate of the automotive warranty reserve, including controls over management’s estimate of the nature, frequency
and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also
included, among others, testing management’s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve. This included evaluating
the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant assumptions, including the nature and frequency of
future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and
frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating whether the
assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance, including a lookback analysis comparing prior period
forecasted claims to actual claims incurred. These procedures also included developing an independent estimate of a portion of the
warranty accrual, comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate, and
testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims. Procedures were performed to test the reliability, completeness,
and relevance of management’s data related to the historical claims processed and that such claims were appropriately used by
management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating
the appropriateness of aspects of management’s model for estimating the nature and frequency of future claims, and testing
management’s warranty reserve for a portion of future warranty claims.

Tesla, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Note 1 – Overview
Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We
design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar
energy generation and energy storage products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”),
organizes the Company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i)
automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.
 
 
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a
controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation,
we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We form VIEs with financing fund
investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with
solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest
ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in
entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest
holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to
receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a
majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary
beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 17, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on
an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to,
determining the transaction price of products and services in arrangements with multiple performance obligations and determining the
amortization period of these obligations, significant economic incentive for residual value guarantee arrangements, sales return
reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial
instruments, residual value of operating lease vehicles, depreciable lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems, fair
value and residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases, warranty liabilities, income taxes, contingencies, determining lease
pass-through financing obligations, the valuation of build-to-suit lease assets, fair value of interest rate swaps and inputs used to value
stock-based compensation. In addition, estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting for business combinations, including the
fair values and useful lives of acquired assets, assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition
Adoption of new accounting standards
ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting
standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (“new revenue standard”) using the
modified retrospective method. As a policy election, the new revenue standard was applied only to contracts that were not
substantially completed as of the date of adoption. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue
standard as an adjustment to the January 1, 2018 opening balance of accumulated deficit. The prior period consolidated financial
statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those
periods.
A majority of our automotive sales revenue is recognized when control transfers upon delivery to customers. For certain
vehicle sales where revenue was previously deferred as an in-substance operating lease, such as certain vehicle sales to customers
or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, we recognize revenue when the vehicles are delivered as a sale with a right of
return. As a result, the corresponding operating lease asset, deferred revenue, and resale value guarantee balances as of
December 31, 2017, were reclassified to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry. Furthermore, the warranty liability
related to such vehicles has been accrued as a result of the change from in-substance operating leases to vehicle sales. Prepayments
on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans, have been reclassified from
deferred revenue to customer deposits. Refer to the Automotive Sales Revenue and Automotive Leasing Revenue sections below for
further discussion of the impact on various categories of vehicle sales.
 
    
Automotive Segment
Automotive Sales Revenue
Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee
Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other
features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our
Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) features and over-the-air software updates. We
recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments
are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features
and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned
upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver
such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which
is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and FSD
features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate
standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other
information that may be available.
At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for
estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and are
immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the
financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.
Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are
not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features and over-
the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain
a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive
revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have
transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the
transaction price of automotive contracts.

Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option
We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and
who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in
connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales
price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period,
which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.
With the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section, we recognize revenue when
control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do
not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process
to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the
time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. The
performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with
automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves
for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected
future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to
determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the
buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Due to
price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2019, we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will
exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments. As a result, along with the estimated variable
consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales
return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues
of $555 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect to be able to
subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a corresponding reduction in cost of automotive sales of $451 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net impact was $104 million reduction in gross profit for the year ended December 31,
2019. The total sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program was $639 million as of
December 31, 2019, of which $93 million was short term. The two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are
discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option and
Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable.
Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating
leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised.
For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases prior to
January 1, 2019, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired at
the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the
consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of
automotive leasing revenue over the same period.
In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value
guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue,
and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the
vehicle to us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value
guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net book value of the
vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory.
72
 
Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features
and over-the-air software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following (in
millions):
 
  Year ended December 31,  
  2019   2018  
Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without
   resale value guarantee— beginning of period  $ 883  $ 476 
Additions   880   532 
Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts   9   (13)
Revenue recognized   (300)  (112)
Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without
   resale value guarantee— end of period  $ 1,472  $ 883
 
 
Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or
partially unsatisfied, as of December 31, 2019. From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018, revenue recognized
during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $220  million. From the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018, revenue
recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $81 million. Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and
without resale value guarantees as of December 31, 2019, we expect to recognize $751 million of revenue in the next 12 months.
The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale
Value Guarantee.
Automotive Regulatory Credits
In connection with the production and delivery of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will
continue to earn various tradable automotive regulatory credits. We have sold these credits, and will continue to sell future credits,
to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other
regulatory requirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted
California’s standard, vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV credits, for compliance
with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their
excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws. We also earn other types of saleable
regulatory credits in the United States and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuels credits. Payments for
regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business.
We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred
to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue from the sale of automotive
regulatory credits totaled $594 million, $419 million and $360 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively.  Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was $140 million and $0 as of December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively. We expect to recognize the deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 in the next 12 months.
Automotive Leasing Revenue
Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as
well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior to the adoption
of the new revenue standard, all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases.
73
 
Direct Vehicle Leasing Program
We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe.
As of December 31, 2019, the direct vehicle leasing program is offered for all new Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles in the
U.S. and for new Model S and Model X vehicles in Canada. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from
Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and
Model X leases, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as
operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and
we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018
and 2017 , we recognized  $532 million, $393 million and $221 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively . As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had deferred $218 million and $110 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments,
which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.
We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of referral fees and sales commissions from
the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and subsequently amortize these costs
over the term of the related lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of
automotive contracts. Total capitalized costs were immaterial as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option
We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales
in the United States. These transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an end-customer, to our leasing
partner. As control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions were
accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under
this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within
resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred
revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on
our borrowing rate. The option period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the pay-off of the initial
loan. We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record
depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement.
Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments)
borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Following the adoption of
ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there was no
material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements
are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the
buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any
remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end
customers can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle
after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. The
maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was  $214 million
and $480 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including $178  million within a 12-month period from
December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $238  million and $558 million, respectively, of such borrowings
recorded in resale value guarantees and $29  million and $93 million, respectively, recorded in deferred revenue liability. For the
year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized  $186  million and $332 million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to
this program. The net carrying amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was $190 million and $469 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
74
 
Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable
For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased
vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to
them, we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases. The process to determine whether there is a significant
economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the
guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this
program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The
amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining
sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue.
The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost
of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to
cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.
In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee
liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue, and the net
book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us during
the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any
remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated
balance sheets to used vehicle inventory. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $115  million and $150 million, respectively, of the
guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next 12 months. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we
recognized $150   million and $158 million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to this program. The net carrying amount of
operating lease vehicles under this program was $83 million and $212 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Services and Other Revenue
Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise,
sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue. There were no significant changes to the
timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard.
Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service
plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the
customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone
selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance
obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the
customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon
customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 
75
 
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Energy Generation and Storage Sales
Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to
residential, small commercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers. Upon adoption of the new lease standard (refer to
Leases section below for details), energy generation and storage sales revenue includes agreements for solar energy systems and
power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) that commence after January 1, 2019, as these are now accounted for under the new revenue
standard. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design, and
installation of the system. Post installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring
system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full
purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control
transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having
jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the
solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation
of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if
we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in
accordance with payment terms customary to the business.
For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the
engineering, design, and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific
phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost
incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated
labor hours for solar energy system sales. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage
system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and
are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility
grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is
recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy
storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and
maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery
of the service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in
advance.
In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the
various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated
based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential
installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated
balance sheets. However, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against
revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy
systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are
typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.
As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance
guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements
specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level.
Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be
required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar
energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy
market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are
estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional
performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a
significant reversal of revenue will not occur.
76
 
We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for
prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over
the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, deferred revenue related to such customer payments
amounted to $156 million and $149 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December
31, 2018 was $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of
January 1, 2018 was $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure
of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with
an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount
corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2019, total transaction price allocated to
performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than
one year was $103  million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $5  million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a
period up to 28 years.
Energy Generation and Storage Leasing
For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage
products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such
systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The
difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance
sheet.
For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have
determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based
on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of
revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer
contract term. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $226  million
and $225 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies
and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2019 and
December 31, 2018, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to $36  million and $37 million, respectively.
We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral
fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the
related agreements.
77
 
  Revenue by source
The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):
 
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2019   2018  
Automotive sales without resale value guarantee  $ 19,212  $ 15,810 
Automotive sales with resale value guarantee (1)   146   1,403 
Automotive regulatory credits   594   419 
Energy generation and storage sales (2)   1,000   1,056 
Services and other   2,226   1,391 
Total revenues from sales and services   23,178   20,079 
Automotive leasing   869   883 
Energy generation and storage leasing (2)   531   499 
Total revenues  $ 24,578  $ 21,461
 
 
(1) We made pricing adjustments to our vehicle offerings in 2019, which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale
value guarantee revenues. Refer to Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee section above for details. The amount
presented represents automotive sales with resale value guarantee in year ended December 31, 2019 net of such pricing
adjustments impact.
(2) Under ASC 842, Leases, solar energy system sales and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor
and were previously accounted for as leases, no longer meet the definition of a lease and are instead accounted for in
accordance with the new revenue standard (refer to the Leases section below for details).
 
Cost of Revenues
Automotive Segment
Automotive Sales
Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including
depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and
infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales
revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it
exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.
Automotive Leasing
Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as
well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and
allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.
Services and Other
Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs to
acquire and certify used vehicles, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of services and other
revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired
subsidiaries to third party customers.
78
 
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight,
warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In addition, where arrangements are
accounted for as operating leases, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy
systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.
 
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (“ASC 842”), Leases, to require lessees to recognize all leases, with
certain exceptions, on the balance sheet, while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to lease accounting under
ASC 840. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, ASU No. 2018-11,
Targeted Improvements, ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, and ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements,
to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. ASC 842 eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies certain
aspects of lessor accounting. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach (“adoption
of the new lease standard”). In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within
the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not
reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. Accordingly, previously reported financial statements, including footnote
disclosures, have not been recast to reflect the application of the new standard to all comparative periods presented. The finance lease
classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.
Agreements for solar energy system leases and PPAs (solar leases) that commence after January 1, 2019, where we are the
lessor and were previously accounted for as operating leases no longer meet the definition of a lease upon the adoption of ASC 842
and are instead accounted for in accordance with the revenue standard. Under these two types of arrangements, the customer is not
responsible for the design of the energy system but rather approved the energy system benefits in terms of energy capacity and
production to be received over the term. Accordingly, the revenue from solar leases commencing after January 1, 2019 are now
recognized as earned, based on the amount of capacity provided or electricity delivered at the contractual billing rates, assuming all
other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize
revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to
account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor
perspective. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated
lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. Additionally,
leases previously identified as build-to-suit leasing arrangements under legacy lease accounting (ASC 840), were derecognized
pursuant to the transition guidance provided for build-to-suit leases in ASC 842. Accordingly, these leases have been reassessed as
operating leases as of the adoption date under ASC 842, and are included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2019.
Operating lease assets are included within operating lease right-of-use assets, and the corresponding operating lease
liabilities are included within accrued liabilities and other for the current portion, and within other long-term liabilities for the long-
term portion on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. Finance lease assets are included within property, plant
and equipment, net, and the corresponding finance lease liabilities are included within current portion of long-term debt and finance
leases for the current portion, and within long-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion for the long-term portion on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
79
 
We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12
months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise.
All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at
commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate
based on the information available at adoption date in determining the present value of lease payments.
Adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The
most significant impacts related to the (i) recognition of right-of-use ("ROU") assets of $1.29 billion and lease liabilities of $1.24
billion for operating leases on the consolidated balance sheet, and (ii) de-recognition of build-to-suit lease assets and liabilities of
$1.62 billion and $1.74 billion, respectively, with the net impact of $97 million recorded to accumulated deficit, as of January 1,
2019. We also reclassified prepaid expenses and other current asset balances of $142 million and deferred rent balance, including
tenant improvement allowances, and other liability balances of $70 million relating to our existing lease arrangements as of
December 31, 2018, into the ROU asset balance as of January 1, 2019. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset
for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The standard did not
materially impact our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows.
The cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 for the adoption of the
new lease standard was as follows (in millions):

Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs
Marketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and
administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. We incurred marketing, promotional and advertising costs of
$27 million, $32 million and $37 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which the majority
is related to promotional activities.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
80
 
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable,
we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.
  
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other
comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation
adjustments that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments, including stock options, restricted stock
units (“RSUs”) and our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”). The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or
performance conditions and the ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based
compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period.
For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance
achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone
becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance
and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the
expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related
market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone
is considered probable of being met. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will
recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is
achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-
based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may
accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte
Carlo simulations (see Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans).
As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our
common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation
of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based
compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative
expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
81
 
Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain
funding arrangements, or funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases.
We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further
determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest
balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at
book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling
interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated
balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV
method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet
represent the amounts the third-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of
the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and
with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of
operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest
balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital
transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to
the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section
of the consolidated balance sheet since these third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other
assets.
Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders
Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income
(loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. During the
year ended December 31, 2019, we increased net loss attributable to common stockholders by $8 million to arrive at the numerator
used to calculate net loss per share. This adjustment represents the difference between the cash we paid to a financing fund investor
for their noncontrolling interest in one of our subsidiaries and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our
consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the
weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using
the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) per
share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive. Since we intend to settle or have settled in
cash the principal outstanding under our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in
2021, 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 and 5.50% Convertible Senior
Notes due in 2022 (assumed in our Maxwell Technologies, Inc. acquisition), we use the treasury stock method when calculating
their potential dilutive effect, if any. Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our notes, we entered into convertible note
hedges and warrants (see Note 12, Debt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially
dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. Warrants which have a strike price above our share price were out of the
money and have not been included in the table below.
 
The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income
(loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):
 
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2019   2018   2017

Convertible senior notes   1   1   2
 
Warrants   —   —   1

Business Combinations
We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition
date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets),
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling
interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain
purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling
interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the
acquisition date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash
equivalents. Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds.
Restricted Cash
We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as
collateral for our sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases, insurance policies, credit
card borrowing facilities and certain operating leases. In addition, restricted cash includes cash received from certain fund investors
that have not been released for use by us and cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities.
The following table totals cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported on the consolidated balance sheets; the
sums are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):
 
  December 31,  December 31,  December 31,  December 31, 
  2019   2018   2017   2016  
Cash and cash equivalents  $ 6,268  $ 3,686  $ 3,368  $ 3,393 
Restricted cash, current portion   246   193   155   106 
Restricted cash, net of current portion  269   398   442   268 
Total as presented in the consolidated
statements of cash flows 
$ 6,783  $ 4,277  $ 3,965  $ 3,767
 
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies
offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to
other automotive manufacturers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance
against accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. We write-off accounts receivable when they are
deemed uncollectible.
We typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related sales as customer payments are
due prior to vehicle delivery, except for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing arrangements
between our customers and the financial institutions.
83
 
MyPower Customer Notes Receivable
We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower was offered by SolarCity to provide
residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding
balances, net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts, are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a
component of prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as MyPower customer notes receivable, net of
current portion, for the long-term portion. In determining the allowance and credit quality for customer notes receivable, we
identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and also consider our historical level of credit losses and
current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses. Customer notes receivable that are individually impaired
are charged-off as a write-off of the allowance for losses. Since acquisition, there have been no new significant customers with
known disputes or collection issues, and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant. In addition, there
were no material non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31, 2019.
Concentration of Risk
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted
cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money
market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured
limits. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance . The risk of
concentration for our interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.
Supply Risk
We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to
deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our
inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and
energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is
recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are
written-off.
We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate
sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the
inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established
and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this
reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
84
 
Operating Lease Vehicles
Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program, vehicles delivered to leasing partners with a resale
value guarantee and a buyback option, and vehicles delivered to customers with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable
are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases under ASC 842 (refer to
the Automotive Leasing Revenue section above for details). Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated
depreciation. We generally depreciate their value, less salvage value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing
revenue over the contractual period. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.85 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles
as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $406 million and $458 million, respectively.
Solar Energy Systems, Net
We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Prior to January 1, 2019, these leases were accounted for as operating leases in
accordance with ASC 840. Under ASC 840, to determine lease classification, we evaluated the lease terms to determine whether
there was a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, whether the lease term was greater than 75% of
the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90% of the fair value at lease inception. As
discussed in the Leases section above, agreements for solar energy system leases and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019 no
longer meet the definition of a lease upon the adoption of ASC 842 and are instead accounted for in accordance with the new
revenue standard. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair values at lease inception and residual values at
lease termination. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets, as follows:
 
Solar energy systems in service    30 to 35 years
Initial direct costs related to customer
   solar energy system lease acquisition
   costs   Lease term (up to
25 years)
 
Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been
interconnected and placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which
will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct
costs related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related
customer agreements.
Property, Plant and Equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as
follows:
 
Machinery, equipment, vehicles and
   office furniture   2 to 12 years
Building and building improvements    15 to 30 years
Computer equipment and software    3 to 10 years
Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms
of the related leases.
Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are
removed from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations.
Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or
expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.
85
 
Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized
interest on construction-in-progress is included within property, plant and equipment and is amortized over the life of the related
assets.
Prior to the adoption of the new lease standard, we were deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the
construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit lease arrangements because of our involvement with the
construction, our exposure to any potential cost overruns or our other commitments under the arrangements. In accordance with
ASC 840, we recognized build-to-suit lease assets under construction and corresponding build-to-suit lease liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. Once construction was completed, if a lease met certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we removed the asset
and liability and accounted for the lease as an operating lease. Otherwise, the lease was accounted for as a capital lease. As a result
of the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all build-to-suit lease assets and have
reassessed these leases to be operating lease right-of-use assets within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019
(refer to Leases section above for details).
Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets
We review our property, plant and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure
recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the
asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted-down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, we have recognized certain impairments of our long-lived assets (refer to Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Note
22, Restructuring and Other, for further details). For the year ended December 31, 2017, we have recognized no material
impairments of our long-lived assets.
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from
one to thirty years.
Goodwill
We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December
31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had not recognized any impairment of goodwill.
Capitalization of Software Costs
For costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs incurred during the application development
stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal use
software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three to ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these
assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the
recoverability of these assets.
Foreign Currency
We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions
based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a
cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to accumulated deficits, including current period income
or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or
loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
in currencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net, in the
consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded foreign currency
transaction gains of $48 million, gains of $2 million and losses of $52 million, respectively.
86
 
Warranties
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and production powertrain components and systems we
sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we
sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best
estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on
actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently
uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause
material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated
with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these
warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is
included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of
operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance as of December 31, 2019 was primarily
related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions): 
 
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2019   2018   2017  
Accrued warranty—beginning of period  $ 748  $ 402  $ 267 
Assumed warranty liability from acquisition   —   —   5 
Warranty costs incurred   (250)  (209)  (123)
Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties,
including
   expirations and foreign exchange impact   36  
 (26)

Additional warranty accrued from adoption of the new
revenue
   standard   —  
 37  
 — 
Provision for warranty   555   544   249 
Accrued warranty—end of period  $ 1,089  $ 748  $ 402
 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and 2017, warranty costs incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating
leases were $20 million, $22 million and $36 million, respectively .  
Solar Renewable Energy Credits
We account for solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”) when they are purchased by us or sold to third-parties. For SRECs
generated by solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any specifically
identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs. We recognize revenue within the
energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the
SREC, if any, is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue.
Deferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue
We have solar energy systems that are eligible for ITCs that accrue to eligible property under the Internal Revenue Code
(“IRC”). Under Section 50(d)(5) of the IRC and the related regulations, a lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee
as the owner of such property for the purposes of claiming the ITCs associated with such property. These regulations enable the
ITCs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the ITCs. Under our lease pass-through fund
arrangements, we can make a tax election to pass-through the ITCs to the investors, who are the legal lessee of the property.
Therefore, we are able to monetize these ITCs to the investors who can utilize them in return for cash payments. We consider the
monetization of ITCs to constitute one of the key elements of realizing the value associated with solar energy systems.
Consequently, we consider the proceeds from the monetization of ITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy
systems.
87
 
Under the new revenue standard, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of ITCs to investors under our lease pass-through
fund arrangements as this is the point in time that control of ITCs has transferred.
We indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our non-compliance. We have concluded that the likelihood of a
recapture event is remote, and consequently, we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the consolidated balance
sheets.
Nevada Tax Incentives
We had entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for sales,
use, real property, personal property and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits.
These incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on either June 30, 2024 or
June 30, 2034 (depending on the incentive). Under these agreements, we were eligible for a maximum of $195 million of
transferable tax credits, subject to capital investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory Nevada of at least $3.50 billion, which
we exceeded during 2017, and specified hiring targets for Gigafactory Nevada, which we exceeded during 2018. We recorded these
credits as earned when we had evidence there was a market for their sale. Credits were applied as a cost offset to either employee
expense or to capital assets, depending on the source of the credits. Credits earned from employee hires or capital spending by our
partners at Gigafactory Nevada were recorded as a reduction to operating expenses. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had
earned the maximum of $195 million of transferable tax credits under these agreements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, to require
financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience,
current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to
clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. Further, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2019-11 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard.
The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption
of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis. We plan to adopt the ASUs on January 1, 2020. The ASUs are currently not
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for
goodwill impairment by removing Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. An entity still has the
option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is prospective.
We plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud
Computing Arrangement that Is a Service Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to
develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The ASU is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is
either retrospective or prospective. We plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
88
 
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its
initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or
annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. We have not early adopted this ASU for 2019.  The ASU is
currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to require lessees to recognize all leases, with limited exceptions, on
the balance sheet, while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to legacy lease accounting, ASC 840. The ASU also
eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope
Improvements for Lessors, and ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements, to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. We
adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated
deficit balance. Prior comparative periods have not been recast under this method, and we adopted all available practical expedients, as
applicable. Further, solar leases that commence on or after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and which were accounted for as
leases under ASC 840, will no longer meet the definition of a lease. Instead, solar leases commencing on or after January 1, 2019 will be
accounted for under the new revenue standard. In addition to recognizing operating leases that were previously not recognized on the
consolidated balance sheet, our build-to-suit leases were also de-recognized with a net decrease of approximately $97 million to our
beginning accumulated deficit after income tax effects, as our build-to-suit leases no longer qualify for build-to-suit accounting and are
instead recognized as operating leases. Upon adoption, our consolidated balance sheet include an overall reduction in assets of
$473 million and a reduction in liabilities of $570 million. The adoption of the ASUs did not have a material impact on the consolidated
statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, to
simplify the application of current hedge accounting guidance. The ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both non-
financial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the
hedged item in the financial statements. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2019, and the ASU did not have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient Transition to Topic 842, to permit
an entity to elect a practical expedient to not re-evaluate land easements that existed or expired before the entity’s adoption of ASU
No. 2016-02, Leases, and that were not accounted for as leases. The ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. 
 
Note 3 – Business Combinations
Maxwell Acquisition
On May 16, 2019 (the “Acquisition Date”), we completed our strategic acquisition of Maxwell Technologies, Inc.
(“Maxwell”), an energy storage and power delivery products company, for its complementary technology and workforce. Pursuant
to the related Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), each issued and outstanding share of Maxwell common
stock was converted into 0.0193 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of our common stock. In addition, Maxwell’s stock option awards
and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our common
stock based on the Exchange Ratio, with the awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect
immediately prior to the acquisition.
Fair Value of Purchase Consideration
The Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was $207 million (902,968 shares issued at $229.49 per share,
the opening price of our common stock on the Acquisition Date).
89
 
Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
 
We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under ASC 805,
Business Combinations. The total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date.  
Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates, can materially impact our
consolidated financial statements. Significant inputs used for the model included the amount of cash flows, the expected period of
the cash flows and the discount rates. In 2019, we finalized our estimate of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed and there were no changes to the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  
The allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s estimate of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, as follows (in millions):
 
Assets acquired:     
Cash and cash equivalents  $ 32 
Accounts receivable   24 
Inventory   32 
Property, plant and equipment, net   27 
Operating lease right-of-use assets   10 
Intangible assets   105 
Prepaid expenses and other assets, current and non-current   3 
Total assets acquired   233 
Liabilities and equity assumed:     
Accounts payable   (10)
Accrued liabilities and other   (28)
Debt and finance leases, current and non-current   (44)
Deferred revenue, current   (1)
Other long-term liabilities   (14)
Additional paid-in capital   (8)
Total liabilities and equity assumed   (105)
Net assets acquired   128 
Goodwill   79 
Total purchase price  $ 207
 
 
Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily
attributable to the expected synergies from integrating Maxwell’s technology into our automotive segment as well as the acquired
talent. Goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes and is not amortized.
Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired
The determination of the fair value of identified intangible assets and their respective useful lives are as follows (in millions,
except for estimated useful life):
 
  Fair Value  Useful Life
(in years) 
Developed technology  $ 102   9 
Customer relations   2   9 
Trade name   1   10 
Total intangible assets  $ 105    
 
 
90
 
Maxwell’s results of operations since the Acquisition Date have been included within the automotive segment. Standalone
and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated financial statements.
Other Acquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed various other acquisitions generally for the related technology and
workforce. Total consideration for these acquisitions was $96 million, of which $80 million was paid in cash. In aggregate, $36
million was attributed to intangible assets, $51 million was attributed to goodwill within the automotive segment, and $9 million
was attributed to net assets assumed. Goodwill is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets
were related to purchased technology, with estimated useful lives of one to nine years.
Standalone and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated
financial statements, either individually or in aggregate.
 
Note 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill increased $130 million from $68 million as of December 31, 2018 to $198 million as of December 31, 2019
primarily due to completed business combinations during the year ended December 31, 2019 (see Note 3, Business Combinations).
There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

During 2019, the Company determined to abandon further development efforts on the IPR&D and therefore impaired the
remaining $47 million in restructuring and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization expense during
the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $44 million, $66 million and $40 million, respectively.

Note 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-
based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a
liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised
of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The
fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities
that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):
 
  December 31, 2019   December 31, 2018  
  Fair Value  Level I  Level II  Level III  Fair Value  Level I  Level II  Level III 
Money market funds (cash and
   cash equivalents &

Interest rate swap liability   (27)  —   (27)  —   (1)  —   (1)  — 
Total  $1,606  $1,632  $ (26) $ —  $1,824  $1,813  $ 11  $ —
 
 
All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using
quoted prices in active markets. Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they were
valued using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest
rates. During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Interest Rate Swaps
We enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed
interest payments, as required by certain of our lenders. We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging instruments.
Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other assets or other long-
term liabilities, with any changes in their fair values recognized as other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of
operations and with any cash flows recognized as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Our interest rate
swaps outstanding were as follows (in millions):

Gross gains  $ 11  $ 22  $ 7 
Gross losses  $ 51  $ 12  $ 13
 
 
Disclosure of Fair Values
Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, MyPower customer notes
receivable, rebates receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits, participation interest and debt. The carrying
values of these financial instruments other than our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021, 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes
due in 2022 and 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 and our subsidiary’s Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in
2020 (collectively referred to as “Convertible Senior Notes” below), 5.30% Senior Notes due in 2025, solar asset-backed notes and
solar loan-backed notes approximate their fair values.
We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 5.30% Senior Notes due in 2025 using commonly
accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II).
In addition, we estimate the fair values of our solar asset-backed notes and solar loan-backed notes based on rates currently offered
for instruments with similar maturities and terms (Level III). The following table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying
values (in millions):
 
  December 31, 2019   December 31, 2018  
  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value 
Convertible Senior Notes  $ 3,686  $ 6,067  $ 3,661  $ 4,347

Note 6 – Inventory
Our inventory consisted of the following (in millions):
 
  December 31,  December 31, 
  2019   2018  
Raw materials  $ 1,428  $ 932 
Work in process   362   297 
Finished goods (1)   1,356   1,581 
Service parts   406   303 
Total  $ 3,552  $ 3,113
 
 
(1) Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles
and energy storage products.
For solar energy systems, we commence transferring component parts from inventory to construction in progress, a
component of solar energy systems, once a lease or PPA contract with a customer has been executed and installation has been
initiated. Additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within
construction in progress.
We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of
inventories is less than the carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded write-downs of
$138 million, $78 million and $124 million, respectively, in cost of revenues.

(1) Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $227 million, $276
million, and $213 million, respectively.
(2) As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, solar energy systems, net, included $36 million of gross finance leased assets with
accumulated depreciation and amortization of $6 million and $4 million, respectively.
 
 
Note 8 – Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
Our property, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following (in millions):
 
  December 31,  December 31, 
  2019   2018  
Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture  $ 7,167  $ 6,329

Less: Accumulated depreciation   (3,734)  (2,699)
Total  $ 10,396  $ 11,330
 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the table above included $1.69 billion of gross build-to-suit lease assets. As a result of the
adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all build-to-suit lease assets and have reassessed
these leases to be operating lease right-of-use assets within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (see Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).
Construction in progress is primarily comprised of tooling and equipment related to the manufacturing of our products and
Gigafactory Shanghai construction. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset classes, and depreciation begins when
an asset is ready for its intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized during periods of significant capital asset
construction and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we
capitalized $31 million and $55 million, respectively, of interest.
Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1.37 billion, $1.11 billion and
$769 million, respectively. Gross property plant and equipment under finance leases as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was
$2.08 billion and $1.52 billion, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on property, plant and equipment under finance leases as of
these dates was $483 million and $232 million, respectively.
94
 
Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the production equipment that it uses to
manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their
production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, Leases, we
account for their production equipment as leased assets when production commences. This results in us recording the cost of their
production equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability
recorded to debt and finance leases. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cumulatively capitalized costs of $1.73 billion and
$1.24 billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic
arrangement. We had cumulatively capitalized total costs for Gigafactory Nevada, including costs under our Panasonic
arrangement, of $5.27 billion and $4.62 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In 2019, the Shanghai government agreed to provide $85 million of certain incentives in connection with us making certain
manufacturing equipment investments at Gigafactory Shanghai, of which $46 million was received in cash and the remaining $39
million was in the form of assets and services contributed by the government. These incentives were taken as a reduction to
property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheet.
 
Note 9 – Accrued Liabilities and Other
 
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):
 
  December 31,  December 31, 
  2019   2018  
Accrued purchases (1)  $ 638  $ 394 
Payroll and related costs   466   449

Build-to-suit lease liability, current portion   —   82 
Operating lease right-of-use liabilities, current portion   228   — 
Other current liabilities   203   372 
Total  $ 2,905  $ 2,094
 
 
(1) Accrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services that we had not been invoiced yet. As we are invoiced
for these goods and services, this balance will reduce and accounts payable will increase.
(2) Taxes payable includes value added tax, sales tax, property tax, use tax and income tax payables.
 
Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2019, we increased our sales return reserve significantly
on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for
details.
As of December 31, 2018, the table above included $82 million of current build-to-suit lease liabilities. As a result of the
adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all build-to-suit lease liabilities and have reassessed
these leases to be operating lease right-of-use liabilities as of December 31, 2019.
 
 
95
 
Note 10 – Other Long-Term Liabilities
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, other long-term liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):
 
  December 31,  December 31, 
  2019   2018  
Accrued warranty reserve  $ 745  $ 547 
Build-to-suit lease liability   —   1,662

Sales return reserve  545   84 
Other noncurrent liabilities   372   308 
Total other long-term liabilities  $ 2,655  $ 2,710
 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the table above included $1.66 billion of non-current build-to-suit lease liabilities. As a result of
the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all build-to-suit lease liabilities and have
reassessed these leases to be operating lease right-of-use liabilities as of December 31, 2019.
Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2019, we increased our sales return reserve significantly
on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for
details on these transactions.
 
 
Note 11 – Customer Deposits
Customer deposits primarily consisted of cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a
vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation, including the
fair values of any customer trade-in vehicles that are applicable toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposits also include
prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposit
amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model, the energy product and the country of delivery. In the case of a vehicle,
customer deposits are fully refundable. In the case of an energy generation or storage product, customer deposits are fully
refundable prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter (in accordance with
applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied towards the
customer’s purchase balance. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we held $726 million and $793 million,
respectively, in customer deposits.

(1) Unused committed amounts under some of our credit facilities and financing funds are subject to satisfying specified
conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories,
leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in
financing funds or various other assets). Upon draw-down of any unused committed amounts, there are no restrictions on use
of available funds for general corporate purposes.
Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only
assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to convertible
senior note conversion features, debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2019, we were in material
compliance with all financial debt covenants, which include minimum liquidity and expense-coverage balances and ratios.
2019 Notes, 2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions
In March 2014, we issued $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in March
2019 and $1.20 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in March 2021 in a public offering. In
April 2014, we issued an additional $120 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $180 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options by the underwriters. The total net
proceeds from the issuances, after deducting transaction costs, were $906 million for the 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion for the 2021
Notes.

Each $1,000 of principal of these notes is initially convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent
to an initial conversion price of $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these
notes had the option to convert on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and may elect to convert on or after December 1,
2020 for the 2021 Notes. The settlement of such an election to convert the 2019 Notes was in cash and/or shares of our common
stock, which we settled in cash on the maturity date. The settlement of such an election to convert the 2021 Notes would be in cash
for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election.
Further, holders of these notes may convert, at their option, prior to the respective dates above only under the following
circumstances: (1) during a quarter in which the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not
consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the
conversion price; (2) during the five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading
price of these notes is less than 98% of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for
each day during such five-consecutive trading day period, or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock
or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon such a conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or deliver (as applicable)
cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. Upon such a conversion of the 2021 Notes, we would
pay cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu
of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to
the applicable maturity date, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate
events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their
notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2019, none of the conditions permitting the
holders of 2021 to early convert had been met. Therefore, the 2021 Notes are classified as long-term.
In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion
features associated with these notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $188 million for the 2019 Notes’ conversion feature and
$369 million for the 2021 Notes’ conversion feature. The resulting debt discounts are being amortized to interest expense at an
effective interest rate of 4.89% and 5.96%, respectively.
In connection with the offering of these notes in March and April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions
whereby we had the option to purchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock for the 2019 Notes and have the option to purchase
initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.8 million shares of our common stock for the 2021 Notes at a price of
$359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $604 million. In addition, we sold warrants
whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per
share for the 2019 Notes and have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.8 million
shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for the 2021 Notes. We received $389 million in total cash proceeds
from the sales of these warrants. Taken together, the purchases of the convertible note hedges and the sales of the warrants are
intended to reduce potential dilution and/or cash payments from the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall
conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 per share for the 2021 Notes.
As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity
and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant
transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.
During the first quarter of 2019, we repaid the $920 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes. As of
December 31, 2019, the convertible note hedges and warrants associated with the 2019 Notes have expired.
As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the 2021 Notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $224
million.
2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions
In March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in March
2022 in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $966 million.
99
 
Each $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is initially convertible into 3.0534 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to an initial conversion price of $327.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after December 15, 2021. Further, holders of the 2022 Notes may
convert, at their option, prior to December 15, 2021 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any quarter beginning after
June 30, 2017, if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last
30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during
the five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less
than 98% of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for each day during such five-
consecutive trading day period or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate
transactions occur. Upon a conversion, we would pay cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of our
common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily
conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase
all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and
unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a
holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2019,
none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2022 Notes to early convert had been met. Therefore, the 2022 Notes are
classified as long-term.
In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion
feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The resulting
debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 6.00%.
In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the
option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$327.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the
holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of
our common stock at a price of $655.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken
together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the
conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $327.50 to $655.00 per share. As these
transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are
not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was
recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.
As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $271 million.
2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions
In May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in May 2024 in
a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.
100
 
Each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is initially convertible into 3.2276 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to an initial conversion price of $309.83 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may
convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter
commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock
for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2)
during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our
common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the
2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change
occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for
cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific
corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024
Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2019, none of the conditions permitting the
holders of the 2024 Notes to early convert had been met. Therefore, the 2024 Notes are classified as long-term.
In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion
feature associated with the 2024 Notes. We recorded to stockholders’ equity $491 million for the conversion feature. The resulting
debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 8.68%.
In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the
option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 5.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$309.83 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the
holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 5.9 million shares of
our common stock at a price of $607.50 per share. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants.
Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution
from the conversion of the 2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $309.83 to $607.50 per share.
As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity
and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant
transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.
As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $644 million.
2025 Notes
In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.30% Senior Notes due in August 2025
pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction
costs, were $1.77 billion.
Credit Agreement
In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit
Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b)
the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn
amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.
Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.
In March 2019, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement to increase the total lender commitments by $500 million to
$2.425 billion and extend the term of substantially all of the total commitments to July 2023.
101
 
1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019
In 2014, SolarCity issued $566 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due on
November 1, 2019 in a private placement.
Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes was convertible into 1.3169 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $759.36 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to
dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). The maximum conversion rate was capped at 1.7449 shares for each $1,000 of
principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $573.10 per share. The convertible
senior notes did not have a cash conversion option and the convertible senior note holders could require us to repurchase their
convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes. 
In November 2019, we fully repaid $566 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes.
Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020
In December 2015, SolarCity issued $113 million in aggregate principal amount of Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes
due on December 1, 2020 in a private placement. $13 million of the convertible senior notes were issued to related parties (see
Note 20, Related Party Transactions).
Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 3.3333 shares of our common stock, which
is equivalent to a conversion price of $300.00 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to
dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). The maximum conversion rate is capped at 4.2308 shares for each $1,000 of principal
of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $236.36 per share. The convertible senior
notes do not have a cash conversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible
senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes. On or after June 30, 2017, the convertible senior notes are
redeemable by us in the event that the closing price of our common stock exceeds 200% of the conversion price for 45 consecutive
trading days ending within three trading days of such redemption notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $41 million.
 
Solar Bonds and other Loans
Solar Bonds are senior unsecured obligations that are structurally subordinate to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our
subsidiaries. Solar Bonds were issued under multiple series with various terms and interest rates. Additionally, we have assumed
the 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 issued by Maxwell, which are convertible into shares of our common stock as a
result of our acquisition of Maxwell.
Automotive Asset-backed Notes
From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into SPEs and issue
Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial
statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the
Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs.
We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The
SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-
backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. A third-party contracted with us to provide administrative and collection
services for these automotive assets.
In November 2019, we issued $861 million in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds
from the issuance, net of discounts and fees, were $857 million.
102
 
Solar Asset-backed Notes
From time to time, our subsidiaries pool and transfer either qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer
contracts or our interests in certain financing funds into Special Purpose Entities (“SPEs”) and issue Solar Asset-backed Notes
backed by these solar assets or interests to investors. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are consolidated in the financial
statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets or distributed by the underlying financing funds to certain SPEs are used
to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining
cash is distributed to us. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer contracts in accordance with our revenue
recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including
the Solar Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. We contracted with the SPEs to provide operations &
maintenance and administrative services for the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 2019, solar assets pledged as collateral
for Solar Asset-backed Notes had a carrying value of $690 million and are included within solar energy systems, net, on the
consolidated balance sheets.
 China Loan Agreements
In March 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a syndicate of lenders in China for a bridge loan
to be used for expenditures related to the construction of and production at our Gigafactory Shanghai. The loan agreement was
terminated in December 2019.    
In September 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a lender in China for an unsecured 12-month
revolving facility of up to RMB 5.0 billion (or the equivalent drawn in U.S. dollars), to finance vehicles in-transit to China.
Borrowed funds bear interest at an annual rate no greater than 90% of the one-year rate published by the People’s Bank of China.
The loan facility is non-recourse to our assets.
In December 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into loan agreements with a syndicate of lenders in China for: (i) a
secured term loan facility of up to RMB 9.0 billion or the equivalent amount drawn in U.S. dollars (the “Fixed Asset Facility”) and
(ii) an unsecured revolving loan facility of up to RMB 2.25 billion or the equivalent amount drawn in U.S. dollars (the “Working
Capital Facility”), in each case to be used in connection with our construction of and production at our Gigafactory Shanghai.
Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Fixed Asset Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the
market quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.7625%, and (ii) for U.S. dollar-denominated loans, the
sum of one-year LIBOR plus 1.3%. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Working Capital Facility accrue interest at a rate equal
to: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the market quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.4525%, and
(ii) for U.S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year LIBOR plus 0.8%. The Fixed Asset Facility is secured by the land and
buildings at Gigafactory Shanghai and both facilities are non-recourse to our other assets.
Cash Equity Debt
In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate
principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain
financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.
Solar Loan-backed Notes
In January 2016 and January 2017, our subsidiaries pooled and transferred certain MyPower customer notes receivable into
two SPEs and issued $330 million in aggregate principal amount of Solar Loan-backed Notes, backed by these notes receivable to
investors. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the transfer of these notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by
us and are consolidated in the financial statements. The payments received by the SPEs from these notes receivable are used to
service the semi-annual principal and interest payments on the Solar Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any
remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the
SPEs, including the Solar Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.
103
 
Warehouse Agreements
In August 2016, our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement (the “2016 Warehouse Agreement”) for
borrowings secured by the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the associated leased vehicles. On August 17, 2017, the
2016 Warehouse Agreement was amended to modify the interest rates and extend the availability period and the maturity date, and
our subsidiaries entered into another loan and security agreement (the “2017 Warehouse Agreement”) with substantially the same
terms as and that shares the same committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement. On August 16, 2018, the 2016
Warehouse Agreement and 2017 Warehouse Agreement were amended to extend the availability period from August 17, 2018 to
August 16, 2019 and extend the maturity date from September 2019 to September 2020. On December 28, 2018, our subsidiaries
terminated the 2017 Warehouse Agreement after having fully repaid all obligations thereunder, and entered into a third loan and
security agreement with substantially the same terms as and that shares the same committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse
Agreement. We refer to these agreements together as the “Warehouse Agreements.” Amounts drawn under the Warehouse
Agreements generally bear interest at a fixed margin above (i) LIBOR or (ii) the commercial paper rate. The Warehouse
Agreements are non-recourse to our other assets.
Pursuant to the Warehouse Agreements, an undivided beneficial interest in the future cash flows arising from certain leases
and the related leased vehicles has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in the consolidated financial
statements. The interest in the future cash flows arising from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims
of our creditors other than pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the Warehouse Agreements. Any excess cash flows not
required to pay obligations under the Warehouse Agreements are available for distributions.
In August 2019, our subsidiaries amended the Warehouse Agreements to extend the availability period from August 16, 2019
to August 14, 2020 and extend the maturity date from September 2020 to September 2021.
In November 2019, we repaid $723 million of the principal outstanding under the Warehouse Agreements.
Solar Term Loans
Our subsidiaries have entered into agreements for term loans with various financial institutions. The term loans are secured
by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiaries, including its interests in certain financing funds, and are non-recourse to our
other assets.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we fully repaid the $159 million in aggregate principal of one term loan.
Canada Credit Facility
In December 2016, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “Canada Credit Facility”) with a bank for
borrowings secured by our interests in certain vehicle leases. In December 2017 and December 2018, the Canada Credit Facility
was amended to add our interests in additional vehicle leases as collateral, allowing us to draw additional funds. Amounts drawn
under the Canada Credit Facility bear interest at fixed rates. The Canada Credit Facility is non-recourse to our other assets.
Solar Renewable Energy Credit and other Loans
We have entered into various solar renewable energy credit and other loan agreements with various financial institutions,
including a solar revolving credit facility. The solar renewable energy credit loan facility is secured by substantially all of the assets
of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including its rights under forward contracts to sell SRECs, and is non-recourse to our
other assets. The solar revolving credit facility is secured by certain assets of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to our other assets.

Note 13 – Leases
We have entered into various non-cancellable operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices,
manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service locations, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We
determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease
commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.
Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases
also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease
liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such
options.
Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain operating
leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease
payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases commencing after January 1, 2019. For
historical leases, we used the index or rate as of the adoption date. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual
payment are expensed as incurred. Lease expense for finance lease payments is recognized as amortization expense of the finance
lease ROU asset and interest expense on the finance lease liability over the lease term.
105
 
The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our

Non-cancellable Operating Lease Receivables
Under the new lease standard, we are the lessor of certain vehicle arrangements as described in Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies. Following the adoption of the new lease standard, solar energy system leases and PPAs that
commenced after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and were previously accounted for as leases, no longer meet the
definition of a lease and are therefore not included in the table as of December 31, 2019 (refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies). As of December 31, 2019, maturities of our operating lease receivables from customers for each of the next
five years and thereafter were as follows (in millions):
 
2020  $ 644 
2021   494 
2022   317

Total  $ 4,036
 
 
The above tables do not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee as the cash
payments were received upfront. For our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by
the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such
arrangements are not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by the related solar energy systems
in the future.
 
Note 14 – Equity Incentive Plans
In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and simultaneously terminated the 2010 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”). No new awards have been granted under the 2010 Plan following the adoption of the 2019 Plan,
but such termination did not affect outstanding awards under the 2010 Plan. The 2019 Plan has similar terms as the 2010 Plan and
provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance
shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options
or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be
granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock
options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the
employment or consulting relationship ends.
As of December 31, 2019, 11 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.

$316.46 and $308.71, respectively. The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017 was $502 million, $546 million and $491 million, respectively.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $237 million,
$293 million and $544 million, respectively.
Fair Value Assumptions
We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate
the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date
generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the weighted-average assumptions in the following table:
 
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2019   2018   2017  
Risk-free interest rate:             
Stock options   2.4%  2.5%  1.8%
ESPP   2.2%  2.0%  1.1%
Expected term (in years):

ESPP   0.5   0.5   0.5 
Expected volatility:             
Stock options   48%  42%  42%
ESPP   53%  43%  35%
Dividend yield:             
Stock options   0.0%  0.0%  0.0%
ESPP   0.0%  0.0%  0.0%
Grant date fair value per share:             
Stock options  $ 111.59  $ 121.92  $ 122.25 
ESPP  $ 78.25  $ 84.37  $ 75.05
 
 
109
 
The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the
closing fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S.
Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, given our then limited
history with employee grants, we used the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term of our employee grants; the
simplified method utilizes the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the employee grant. Beginning with the
fourth quarter of 2017, we use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is
based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our
common stock.
2018 CEO Performance Award
In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 20,264,042 stock option awards to our CEO (the
“2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule
based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming
continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each
vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of
Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100 billion for the first tranche and
increases by increments of $50 billion thereafter, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on revenue
or eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an
annualized basis. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense,
provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation.
 
Total Annualized Revenue
(in billions)  Annualized Adjusted EBITDA
(in billions)
$20.0  $1.5
$35.0  $3.0
$55.0  $4.5
$75.0  $6.0
$100.0  $8.0
$125.0  $10.0
$150.0  $12.0
$ 175.0  $14.0
 
As of December 31, 2019, two operational milestones have been achieved: (i) $20.0 billion total annualized revenue and (ii)
$1.5 billion annualized adjusted EBITDA, each subject to the formal certification by our Board of Directors, while no market
capitalization milestones have been achieved. Consequently, no shares subject to the 2018 CEO Performance Award have vested as
of the date of this filing.
 
As of December 31, 2019, the following operational milestones were considered probable of achievement:
 • Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion
 • Total revenue of $35.0 billion
Stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche under the 2018 CEO Performance Award is recognized
over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected
achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time
when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being met. If such operational milestone becomes probable any
time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related
market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related
operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the
operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized.
110
 
The market capitalization milestone period and the valuation of each tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation
and is used as the basis for determining the expected achievement period. The probability of meeting an operational milestone is
based on a subjective assessment of our future financial projections. No tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest
unless a market capitalization and a matching operational milestone are both achieved. The first tranche of the 2018 CEO
Performance Award will not vest unless our market capitalization were to approximately double from the initial level at the time the
award was approved, based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average (counting only
trading days). Upon vesting of a tranche, all unamortized expense for the tranche will be recognized immediately. Additionally,
stock-based compensation represents a non-cash expense and is recorded as a selling, general, and administrative operating expense
in our consolidated statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2019, we had $527 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the operational
milestones that were considered probable of achievement, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.72 years.
As of December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $1.29 billion for the operational milestones
that were considered not probable of achievement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded stock-based compensation
expense of $296 million related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. From March 21, 2018, when the grant was approved by our
stockholders, through December 31, 2018, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $175 million related to this award.
The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily related to a $72 million cumulative catch-up expense for the
service provided from the grant date when an additional operational milestone was considered probable of being met in the fourth
quarter of 2019 and a shorter expense period in the prior year.
2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards
In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive
pay with our stockholders’ interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of our Board
of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees (excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 1,073,000 shares
of our common stock. Each award consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the
attainment of the future performance milestones, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date:
 • 1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production vehicle;
 • 1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;
 • 1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and
 • 1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater than 30% for any three-year period.
As of December 31, 2019, the following performance milestones had been achieved:
 • Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;
 • Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and
 • Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period.
We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance milestone becomes probable of achievement.
As of December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $5 million for the performance milestone
that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not record any
additional stock-based compensation related to these awards. For the year ended December 2017, we recorded stock-based
compensation expense of $7 million related to these awards.
111
 
2012 CEO Performance Award
In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock option awards to our CEO (the “2012 CEO Performance
Award”). The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the
attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service through each
vesting date. Each vesting tranche requires a combination of a pre-determined performance milestone and an incremental increase
in our market capitalization of $4.00 billion, as compared to our initial market capitalization of $3.20 billion at the time of grant. As
of December 31, 2019, the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the following performance milestones
had been achieved:
 • Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;
 • Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype;
 • Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;
 • Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;
 • Successful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype;
 • Successful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype;
 • Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle;
 • Aggregate production of 200,000 vehicles; and
 • Aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles.
We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of
December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $6 million for the performance milestone that was
considered not probable of achievement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded no stock-based compensation
expense related to the 2012 CEO Performance Award. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the stock-based compensation we
recorded related to this award was immaterial. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded stock-based compensation
expense of $5 million related to this award.
Our CEO earns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he
is subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at our
CEO’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of his base salary.
Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information
The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of
operations (in millions):
 
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2019   2018   2017

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the periods presented due to cumulative losses and
valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.57 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense
related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.91 years.
112
 
ESPP
Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible
compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first
and last trading days of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we issued 0.5
million, 0.4 million and 0.4 million shares under the ESPP with an associated expense of $40 million, $109 million and $71
million, respectively. There were 7 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2019.
 
 
Note 15 – Income Taxes
A provision for income taxes of $110 million, $58 million and $32 million has been recognized for the years ended

On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law making significant changes to the
Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system
and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We were required to recognize the effect of
the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as
reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the
consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full
valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets.

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following (in millions):
 
  December 31,  December 31, 
  2019   2018  
Deferred tax assets:         
Net operating loss carry-forwards  $ 1,846  $ 1,760 
Research and development credits   486   377 
Other tax credits   126   128 
Deferred revenue   301   156 
Inventory and warranty reserves   243   165 
Stock-based compensation   102   102 
Operating lease right-of-use liabilities   290   — 
Accruals and others   16   28 
Total deferred tax assets   3,410   2,716 
Valuation allowance   (1,956)  (1,806)
Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance   1,454   910 
Deferred tax liabilities:         
Depreciation and amortization   (1,185)  (861)
Investment in certain financing funds   (17)  (33)
Operating lease right-of-use assets   (263)  — 
Other   (24)  (24)
Total deferred tax liabilities   (1,489)  (918)
Deferred tax liabilities, net of valuation allowance
   and deferred tax assets  $ (35) $ (8)
 
As of December 31, 2019, we recorded a valuation allowance of $1.96 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that
we do not expect to be realized. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $150 million, decreased by $38
million, and increased by $821 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes in
valuation allowance are primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have
net $151 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully
realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred
tax assets taking into account multiple factors, including the results of operations and magnitude of excess tax deductions for stock-
based compensation. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is
sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation
allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the
release is recorded.

The reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31,
2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions):
 
  Year Ended December 31,  
  2019    2018    2017  
Tax at statutory federal rate  $ (139)  $ (211)  $ (773)

Unrecognized tax benefits   17    1    3 
Change in valuation allowance   91    131    719 
Provision for income taxes  $ 110   $ 58   $ 32
 
 
(1) As of  January 1, 2017, upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment
Accounting, excess tax benefits from share-based award activity incurred from the prior and current years are reflected as a
reduction of the provision for income taxes. The excess tax benefits result in an increase to our gross U.S. deferred tax assets
that is offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2019, we had $7.51 billion of federal and $6.16 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards
available to offset future taxable income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2028 for state
purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity prior to our acquisition in 2016 and, therefore, are subject to
change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not
expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.
As of December 31, 2019, we had research and development tax credits of $320 million and $284 million for federal and
state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various
amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In
addition, we have other general business tax credits of $125 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to
significantly expire until 2033.
No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability
associated with these earnings is immaterial.
Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-
forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that
no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior
ownership changes.

Uncertain Tax Positions
The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):
 
     
December 31, 2016  $ 204 
Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions   (31)
Increases in balances related to current year tax
   positions   84 
Changes in balances related to effect of U.S. tax law change  (58)
December 31, 2017   199 
Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions   (6)
Increases in balances related to current year tax
   positions   60 
December 31, 2018   253 
Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions   (39)
Increases in balances related to current year tax
   positions   59 
December 31, 2019  $ 273
 
 
As of December 31, 2019, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax
expense and were immaterial. Unrecognized tax benefits of $247 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate since
the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance.
We file income tax returns in the U.S., California and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under
examination by the IRS for the years 2015 and 2016. Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2018 remain subject to
examination for federal income tax purposes, and tax years 2004 to 2018 remain subject to examination for California income tax
purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and California income
tax purposes. Tax years 2008 to 2018 remain subject to examination in other U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
The potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to unrecognized tax benefits within the next
twelve months. However, we cannot reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time.  
The U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation
expense in a cost-sharing arrangement. On June 7, 2019, the Court reversed the Tax Court decision and upheld the validity of Treas.
Reg. Section 1.482-7A(d)(2), requiring stock-based compensation costs be included in the costs shared under a cost sharing
agreement. Given that the current active decision can still be appealed because Altera has the option to petition up to the Supreme
Court, Tesla’s position is to continue to include stock-based compensation in cost sharing allocation agreement. If and when the
current tax court’s decision is overturned, we will treat the amount previously shared as a pre-payment to future cost sharing
agreement costs. Because we have a full valuation allowance in the U.S., any potential tax benefits would increase our U.S.
deferred tax asset and would not have a material impact to our financials.

Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York
We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (the “SUNY
Foundation”) for a manufacturing facility constructed on behalf of the SUNY Foundation and which was substantially completed in
April 2018.  We use this facility, referred to as Gigafactory New York, primarily for the development and production of our Solar
Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components, and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-
approved functions.  Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, on behalf of the SUNY Foundation, we
have and will continue to install certain utilities and other improvements and acquire certain equipment designated by us to be used
in the manufacturing facility. The SUNY Foundation covered (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing facility up to $350
million, (ii) the acquisition and commissioning of the manufacturing equipment in an amount up to $275 million and (iii) $125
million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) only, subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of
New York; and we were responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts. The SUNY Foundation
owns the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation. Following completion of
the manufacturing facility, we have commenced leasing of the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment owned by
the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10 years, with an option to renew, for $2.00 per year plus utilities. Following the
adoption of ASC 842, we no longer recognize the build-to-suit asset and related depreciation expense or the corresponding
financing liability and related amortization for Gigafactory New York in our consolidated financial statements.
Under the terms of the operating lease arrangement, we are required to achieve specific operational milestones during the
initial lease term; which include employing a certain number of employees at the manufacturing facility, within western New York
and within the State of New York within specified periods following the completion of the manufacturing facility. We are also
required to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses and other costs in the State of New York within
10 years following the achievement of full production. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each
anniversary of the commissioning of the manufacturing facility, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation
requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million “program payment” to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we
fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional
amounts might become payable by us. As of December 31, 2019, we have met the targets as of the applicable measurement dates
and anticipate meeting the remaining obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New
York.
Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China
We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use
rights where we are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08
billion in capital expenditures, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are
unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in accordance with the Chinese government’s standard
terms for such arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive compensation for the
remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. We believe the capital expenditure requirement and the tax revenue target
will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the volumes we are forecasting.

Legal Proceedings
Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition
Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported
stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members
of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in
connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and
seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On
March 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument
on the motion. On March 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for interlocutory
appeal, but the Delaware Supreme Court denied that request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this early
stage of the case. Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018, and mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and
defendants filed respective motions for summary judgment on August 25, 2019, and further mediations were held on October 3,
2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January 22, 2020, all of the
director defendants except Elon Musk reached a tentative settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount that would
be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any
party. Tesla will receive such amount, which would be recognized as a gain in its financial statements, if the settlement is finally
approved by the Court. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion and granted in
part and denied in part defendants’ previously-filed motion.  Fact and expert discovery is complete, and the case is set for trial in
March 2020.
These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21,
2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors.
Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.
We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.
We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.
Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles
On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California against Tesla, two of its current officers, and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws
and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from
May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements
regarding the Company’s preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 23, 2018, and
defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 25, 2018. The court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with leave to
amend.  Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on September 28, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint on February 15, 2019.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on March 22, 2019, and on March 25, 2019, the
Court ruled in favor of defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  On April 8, 2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal
and on July 17, 2019 filed their opening brief. We filed our opposition on September 16, 2019. We continue to believe that the
claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.
118
 
On October 26, 2018, in a similar action, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the Superior Court of California in
Santa Clara County against Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities by Tesla in August 2017.
The complaint alleges misrepresentations made by Tesla regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by
the end of 2017 in connection with such offering and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a
purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities in such offering. Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court.  On January 22,
2019, plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court, instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla, Elon Musk and
seven initial purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
who is hearing the above-referenced earlier filed federal case.  On February 5, 2019, the Court stayed this new case pending a
ruling on the motion to dismiss the complaint in such earlier filed federal case.  After such earlier filed federal case was dismissed,
defendants filed a motion on July 2, 2019 to dismiss this case as well. This case is now stayed pending a ruling from the appellate
court on such earlier filed federal case with an agreement that if defendants prevail on appeal in such case, this case will be
dismissed. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to
estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.
Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award
On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of
Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust
enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan. The
complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On
August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018 and
defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018.  The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On
September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach
of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Our answer was filed on December 3, 2019, and trial is set for June 2021. We
believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.
Securities Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction
Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon
Musk in connection with Elon Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are
now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects,
they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified
compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs filed their
consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors.  The now-
consolidated purported stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel was briefed and argued
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint on November 22, 2019.  The hearing on the motion is set for March 6, 2020.  We believe that the claims have
no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated with
these claims.
Between October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery
against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made and actions
connected to a potential going private transaction.  In addition to these cases, on October 25, 2018, another derivative lawsuit was
filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as
then constituted. The Courts in both the Delaware federal court and Delaware Court of Chancery actions have consolidated their
respective actions and stayed each consolidated action pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported
stockholder class action. We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to
estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated with these claims.
119
 
On March 7, 2019, various stockholders filed a derivative suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of
the Company, naming Elon Musk and Tesla’s board of directors, also related to Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that is the
basis of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action as well as Mr. Musk’s February 19, 2019 Twitter post
regarding Tesla’s vehicle production. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
unspecified damages, and other relief. Plaintiffs moved for expedited proceedings in connection with the declaratory and injunctive
relief.  Briefs were filed on March 13, 2019 and the hearing held on March 18, 2019.  Defendants prevailed, with the Court denying
plaintiffs’ request for an expedited trial and granting defendants’ request to stay this action pending the outcome of the above-
referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. 
Settlement with SEC related to Potential Going Private Transaction
On October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the
terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. Without
admitting or denying any of the SEC’s allegations, and with no restriction on Mr. Musk’s ability to serve as an officer or director on
the Board (other than as its Chair), among other things, we and Mr. Musk paid civil penalties of $20 million each and agreed that an
independent director will serve as Chair of the Board for at least three years, and we appointed such an independent Chair of the
Board and two additional independent directors to the Board, and further enhanced our disclosure controls and other corporate
governance-related matters. On April 26, 2019, the settlement was amended to modify certain of the previously-agreed disclosure
procedures to clarify the application of such procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the
prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification.
Certain Investigations and Other Matters
We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state,
federal and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests.
 
In particular, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was
considering taking Tesla private and (b) certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public
statements relating to Model 3 production. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with the settlement with the SEC
described above.  On December 4, 2019, the SEC (i) closed the investigation into the projections and other public statements
regarding Model 3 production rates and (ii) issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts
including Tesla’s regular financing arrangements.  Separately, the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information
about the above matters related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates.
Aside from the settlement, as amended, with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s statement that he was considering taking Tesla
private, there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge no government
agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been
cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing
matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on
our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial position.
We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If
an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business,
results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.
120
 
Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns
We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited
circumstances resulting from reductions in U.S. Treasury grants or investment tax credits (“ITC”s). Generally, such obligations
would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the U.S. Treasury
Department for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants or as assessed by the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury
grants. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure
from this obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any guidelines issued by the U.S. Treasury
Department on solar energy system valuations for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants and any audits undertaken by the IRS.
We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not
probable or material based on the facts known at the filing date.
The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference
between the fair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the U.S.
Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming U.S. Treasury grants or the values the
IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants. We claim U.S.
Treasury grants based on guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use
fair values determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining
the ITCs that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine future revisions to U.S. Treasury
Department guidelines governing solar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs or
U.S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under
this obligation as of each balance sheet date.
We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The
amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar
energy produced. We also currently participate in one state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the
tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors
in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for
any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received.
Our lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of
all solar energy systems in a fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to refund master lease prepayments
previously received from investors. Any refunds of master lease prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing
obligation.
Letters of Credit
As of December 31, 2019, we had $282 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.
 
Note 17 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements
We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy
systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets
into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities
(“VIEs”) and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810,
Consolidation. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions
that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer
contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables.
We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than
participating.
121
 
As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated
in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses,
estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our
subsidiary as specified in the agreements.
Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market
value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.
Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.
Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to
the funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances,
we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our
general credit or to that of other funds. None of the assets of the funds had been pledged as collateral for their obligations.
The aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and
balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):

Note 18 – Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation
Through December 31, 2019, we had entered into eight transactions referred to as “lease pass-through fund arrangements”.
Under these arrangements, our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through
arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years. These solar energy
systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years. These solar energy systems are
included within solar energy systems, net on the consolidated balance sheets.
122
 
The cost of the solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was
$1.05 billion. The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $101 million and $66 million,
respectively. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2019 was $94 million, of which $57 million is
classified as a current liability. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2018 was $112 million, of
which $62 million was classified as a current liability. Lease pass-through financing obligation is included in accrued liabilities and
other for the current portion and other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion on the consolidated balance sheets.
Under a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our
subsidiaries, and in some cases, subsequent periodic payments. We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair
value of the assigned ITCs, which is estimated by discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest
rate and is accounted for separately (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). We account for the remainder of the
investor payments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease pass-through financing obligation, which is repaid
from the future customer lease payments and any incentive rebates. A portion of the amounts received by the investor is allocated to
interest expense using the effective interest rate method.
The lease pass-through financing obligation is non-recourse once the associated solar energy systems have been placed in-
service and the associated customer arrangements have been assigned to the investors. However, we are required to comply with
certain financial covenants specified in the contractual agreements, which we had met as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we are
responsible for any warranties, performance guarantees, accounting and performance reporting. Furthermore, we continue to
account for the customer arrangements and any incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements, regardless of whether the
cash is received by us or directly by the investors.
As of December 31, 2019, the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors, for each of the next
five years and thereafter, were as follows (in millions):
 
2020  $ 42 
2021   41 
2022   33 
2023   26 
2024   18 
Thereafter   450 
Total  $ 610
 
For two of the lease pass-through fund arrangements, our subsidiaries have pledged its assets to the investors as security for
its obligations under the contractual agreements.
Each lease pass-through fund arrangement has a one-time master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when
the capacity and the placed-in-service dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreed-upon date. As part
of this mechanism, the master lease prepayment amount is updated, and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease
prepayment or entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment. Any additional master lease prepayments are recorded as
an additional lease pass-through financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease pass-
through financing obligation.
 
 
Note 19 – Defined Contribution Plan
We have a 401(k) savings plan that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible
compensation, subject to certain limitations. Participants are fully vested in their contributions. We did not make any contributions
to the 401(k) savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (other than employee deferrals of eligible
compensation).

Note 20 – Related Party Transactions
Related party balances were comprised of the following (in millions):
 
  December 31,  December 31, 
  2019   2018  
Convertible senior notes due to related parties  $ 3  $ 3
 
 
Our convertible senior notes are not re-measured at fair value (refer to Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments). As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the unpaid principal balance of convertible senior notes due to related parties is $3 million.
In March 2017, our CEO purchased from us 95,420 shares of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering
price for an aggregate $25 million.
In April 2017, our CEO exercised his right under the indenture to convert all of his Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes
due in 2020, which had an aggregate principal amount of $10 million. As a result, on April 26, 2017, we issued 33,333 shares of
our common stock to our CEO in accordance with the specified conversion rate, and we recorded an increase to additional paid-in
capital of $10 million.
In November 2018, our CEO purchased from us 56,915 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a per share
price equal to the last closing price of our stock prior to the execution of the purchase agreement for an aggregate $20 million.
In May 2019, our CEO purchased from us 102,880 shares of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering
price for an aggregate $25 million.
 
Note 21 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas
We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive
segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive
regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-
sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers, and
vehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales, and
leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.
Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information. The following table presents revenues and
gross profit by reportable segment (in millions):

Note 22 – Restructuring and Other
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve
efficiency. As a result, we recognized $50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and losses from
closing certain stores impacting both segments. We recognized $47 million in impairment related to the IPR&D intangible asset as
we abandoned further development efforts (refer to Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for details) and $15 million for the
related equipment within the energy generation and storage segment. We also incurred a loss of $37 million for closing operations
in certain facilities. On the statement of cash flows, the amounts were presented in the captions in which such amounts would have
been recorded absent the impairment charges. The employee termination expenses were substantially paid by December 31, 2019,
while the remaining amounts were non-cash.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we carried-out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve
efficiency and recognized $37 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a certain facility. The
employee termination cash expenses of $27 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were
non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $55 million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash)
from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, the shortening
of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of
the IPR&D asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13 million. We recognized
settlement and legal expenses of $30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-
private proposal for Tesla. These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and
procedures relative to their costs.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31,
2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide
reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2019.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, as stated in their report which is included herein.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
127
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year
ended December 31, 2019, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
