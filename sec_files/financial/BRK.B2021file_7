Part I
Item 1. Business Description
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a
large number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis
and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution
businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein.
Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated
business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant
capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses.
Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance
practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution
of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriate successor to the
Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to
ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees.
Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 360,000 people worldwide at the end of 2020. Human
capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized
management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses establish specific policies and practices for their businesses concerning
the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Such policies and practices generally address, among other
things: maintaining a safe work environment for employees, customers and other business partners, offering competitive
compensation to employees, including health insurance and retirement benefits and incentives, providing learning and career
development opportunities, and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the
workforce.
Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses
Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based
insurance entities. Berkshire’s insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty and life, accident
and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance businesses employed approximately 51,000 people at the end of 2020.
In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly
subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may
arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or
reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.
Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance
coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the direct insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves
coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-
share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct
insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for
all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts
may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.
Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory
considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or
foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers
compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business
ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.
K-1
 
Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which
they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially
solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and
establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s
authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their
shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts
are subject to prior regulatory approval.
Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to
as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium
rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers.
Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers
who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers.
Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally
not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts.
The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The
NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual
statutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its
activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations
and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with
financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements.
U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles
(“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The
standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk
management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing various
regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. For example, the U.S. state regulators now require
insurance groups to file an annual report, called an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead regulator. U.S.
state regulators formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic
international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead group wide supervisor for our group of
insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including a group
capital calculation tool and various liquidity assessments, that could be imposed on insurance groups in the future.
Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their
competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $237 billion at
December 31, 2020. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M.
Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program
(“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The
Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act of 2019 (the “2019 TRIA Reauthorization”). Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under
TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry
insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in 2020, or any calendar year thereafter.
To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing
policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal
share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA
participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft,
surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal
reinsurance of terrorism losses.
K-2
 
During 2020 and thereafter, in the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers
(conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an
insurance group’s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant
commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2021 for Berkshire’s
insurance group is expected to approximate $1.4 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of
the federal government coverage for each TRIA year.
The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct
business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the
requirements differ substantially. For example:
 • in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others,
only annual reports;
 • some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators
permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;
 • the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer's use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;
 • policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;
 • the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country;
 • the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary significantly
by country; and
 • regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.
Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee
insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.
Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of
subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom (“UK”),
Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in other countries, including Canada, various members of the
European Union (“EU”), Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau and Dubai. Most of these foreign jurisdictions
impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and
records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to
multinational application of certain U.S. laws.
There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the
potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic
developments.
On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the EU (“Brexit”), which resulted in the UK’s
withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the UK leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance
DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the
EU following Brexit. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU as a result of Brexit, Berkshire expects to continue to
maintain a substantial presence in London.
Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary
Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products
that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long time
periods (creating “float,” see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and to
reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment
expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments.
Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows.
GEICO—GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government
Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company,
GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County
Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger
automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles,
all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer
homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those
offered by GEICO.
GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly
to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through
regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states.
K-3
 
The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private
passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell
directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and
USAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of
approximately 36% over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2019, the five largest
automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2019 of approximately 58% based on written premiums, with GEICO’s market
share being second largest at approximately 13.8%. Since that data was published, GEICO’s management estimates its current
market share may have declined, depending on how the effects of pandemic-related premium credit programs will be reflected in
A.M. Best’s measurements. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather
conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.
State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance
companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to
focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on
customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to
manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects it and other service
marks through appropriate registrations.
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group—The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of
independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the
United States. These various operations are discussed below.
NICO and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an
admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents
and brokers.
The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation,
commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to
provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where
coverage is available only through state-operated workers’ compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in
Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) offers commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional
liability, executive and professional, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowner’s insurance through Berkshire Hathaway
Specialty Insurance Company and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. BH Specialty writes primary and excess policies on an
admitted and surplus basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in
Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several U.S. cities. BH Specialty also maintains international offices
located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. BH Specialty writes business
through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents.
MedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance in the United States. MedPro
provides customized HCL insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare
professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance
solutions to the international markets through other Berkshire insurance affiliates, delivers liability insurance to other professionals,
and offers specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other
Berkshire affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”) includes a group of five specialty insurers that underwrite commercial,
professional and personal lines insurance on an admitted basis, as well as an excess and surplus basis. USLI markets policies in all
50 states and the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite
and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania.
The Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide
workers’ compensation, business owners’, commercial auto, commercial package and homeowners’ products to over 350,000 small
and mid-sized businesses. GUARD also offers complementary professional liability and umbrella products nationwide. Policies are
offered through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Central
States Indemnity Company of Omaha, based in Omaha, Nebraska, primarily writes credit card credit insurance, Medicare
Supplement insurance and agricultural equipment insurance.
On October 1, 2018, NICO acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”). MLMIC has been the leading writer of
medical professional liability insurance in New York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes its policies mostly on a
K-4
 
direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. In October 2019, Berkshire sold its 81%
interest in Applied Underwriters, Inc.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group—Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire
Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers
and reinsurers worldwide. Reinsurance business is written through National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in
Nebraska, its subsidiaries and various other insurance subsidiaries wholly owned by Berkshire (collectively, the “NICO Group”)
and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s
underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. BHRG also conducts business activities globally in 23
countries.
The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and
coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived
level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance
transactions.
Property/casualty
The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis,
catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual
risks for clients worldwide.
The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from
changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual
reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited
(“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries. The
General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-
share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a
facultative basis.
General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which
is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in
North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 13 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada.
In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity
Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and
professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general
underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive
customers.
General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG
(“GRAG”), based in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in 22 countries. International business
is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns
the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of
Syndicate 435.
Life/health
The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the
General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business
is marketed on a direct basis. Approximately 35% of the aggregate life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group were
in the Asia Pacific compared to 26% in the United States, 22% in Western Europe and 17% throughout the rest of the world.
Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write
reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures.
BHLN and its affiliates have also periodically reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income, and similar benefit risks on
closed-blocks of variable annuity reinsurance contracts.
K-5
 
Retroactive reinsurance
NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding
companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and
casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or
for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to
aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. For instance, an excess contract written in January
2017 provides indemnification for 80% of up to $25 billion in excess of $25 billion retained by the ceding company. Significant
amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts.
The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms
since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to
exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts
of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future
periods.
Periodic payment annuity
BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these
policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These
policies, generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of other insurers, known as
structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in
establishing annuity premiums and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities.
Investments of insurance businesses—Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets.
Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very large portfolio of
publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and
short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and
insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity
securities than is customary in the insurance industry.
Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and
reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities
that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and
health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred
policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from
approximately $88 billion at the end of 2015 to approximately $138 billion at the end of 2020. The cost of float can be measured as
the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In four of the past five years, Berkshire’s cost of float was
negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains.
Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF
Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000 employees at
the end of 2020. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business.
In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States,
BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries.
Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company
quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the
international, national and regional levels.
BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern
United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many
smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing
agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending
December 31, 2020, approximately 37% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 26% from industrial products,
24% from agricultural products and 13% from coal.

Regulatory Matters
BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are
subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the
United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as
other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction
over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line
extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB
proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.
The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent
of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas
not otherwise preempted by federal law.
Environmental Matters
BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities
associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting
chemicals and other hazardous materials.
Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to
commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular,
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and
severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the
original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental
costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF
operations.
Competition
The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated
motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The
presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage
continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could
further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads
seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.
As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF
Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I
railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.

K-8
 
Regulatory Matters
PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local
agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement
provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC
regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the
expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention;
securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement
authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.3 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the
Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of
1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.
With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their
service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of
customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail
customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail
electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state
regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a
reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the
Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and
distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission and distribution-only services.
Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution
systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets
Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023.
AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the
Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The
AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad
authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under
the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta
Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of
those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system
(“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the
AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.
The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage
operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the
Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and
conditions of service, (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the
extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas import/export
facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety
within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are
issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design,
construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.
Environmental Matters
BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change,
renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal,
hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and
future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean
Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and
other sanctions.
The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for
protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be
promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at
those facilities to comply with the requirements.
K-9
 
Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers
to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington,
California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal
clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact
electricity generators and natural gas providers.
In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for
coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of
limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius;
establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at
achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and
progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new
commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris
Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris
Agreement formally entered into force November 4, 2016. The United States completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement
on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 21, 2021, and the United States
completed its reentry on February 19, 2021.
On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan,
which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units
of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule,
which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of
emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies
and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source
itself.
The EPA’s repeal and replacement of the Clean Power Plan is not expected to have a material impact on BHE and its energy
subsidiaries. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local
governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.
BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers
and on actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, through December 31, 2020, BHE’s cumulative investment in
wind, solar, geothermal and biomass generation is approximately $34 billion.

Industrial products
Precision Castparts
Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality investment
castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also
manufactures seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine (“IGT”) and nuclear power plants; downhole casing and tubing,
fittings and various mill forms in a variety of nickel and steel alloys for severe-service oil and gas environments; investment
castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard
mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding
consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control and other industries;
revert management solutions; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment casting
and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and forging industries; grinder
pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the
power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener market and other applications.
Investment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal
components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using other methods.
PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, IGT and other aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical
implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon
and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines.
PCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets, including seamless
pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine and nuclear power plants, and downhole casings and tubing pipe for severe service oil and
gas markets. PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non-
aerospace applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. These titanium products are used
to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy and other industrial end markets.
PCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and
precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and power and
energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and construction equipment,
shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliance and recreation markets. PCC has several significant customers,
including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General
Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney).
The majority of PCC’s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual
terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience
significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. In 2020, delay requests
increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX produced significant adverse effects on
the PCC aerospace business in 2020. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and
customer destocking at extraordinary rates. Aircraft build rates have not yet begun to recover in any meaningful way. During 2020,
PCC significantly reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% since the end of 2019 to help align operations to reduced aircraft
build rates. The restructuring actions taken began to improve margins in late 2020 from the low margins experienced earlier in the
year and further margin improvements are expected going forward.
PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by
competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its
manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices
and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of
the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several
factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid
PCC in maintaining competitive advantages.
Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and
molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products.
The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor
relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.

significant competition in most of its markets, competes by offering a broad range of high-quality products and services targeted at
its niche markets. Railcars are typically leased for multiple-year terms and most of the leases are renewed upon expiration. Due to
selective ongoing capital investment, utilization rates (the number of railcars on lease as a percentage of the total fleet) of the railcar
fleet are generally high.

and flooring products. Shaw designs and manufactures over 3,800 styles of tufted carpet, wood and resilient flooring for residential
and commercial use under about 30 brand and trade names and under certain private labels. Shaw also provides project
management and installation services. Shaw’s manufacturing operations are fully integrated from the processing of raw materials
used to make fiber through the finishing of carpet. In 2018, Shaw acquired Sanquahar Tile Services in Scotland, which
manufactures and distributes carpet tile throughout Europe. Shaw also manufactures or distributes a variety of hardwood, wood
plastic composite (WPC), stone plastic composite (SPC) and vinyl and laminate floor products (“hard surfaces”). Shaw’s soft and
hard surface products are sold in a broad range of patterns, colors and textures. Shaw operates Shaw Sports Turf and Southwest
Greens International, LLC, which provide synthetic sports turf, golf greens and landscape turf products.
Shaw products are sold wholesale to over 47,000 retailers, distributors and commercial users throughout the United States,
Canada and Mexico and are also exported to various overseas markets. Shaw’s wholesale products are marketed domestically by
over 2,100 salaried and commissioned sales personnel directly to retailers and distributors and to large national accounts. Shaw’s
seven carpet, nine hard surface, one sample full-service distribution facility, three sample satellite locations and 30 redistribution
centers, along with centralized management information systems, enable it to provide prompt and efficient delivery of its products
to both its retail customers and wholesale distributors.
Substantially all carpet manufactured by Shaw is tufted carpet made from nylon, polypropylene and polyester. In the tufting
process, yarn is inserted by multiple needles into a synthetic backing, forming loops, which may be cut or left uncut, depending on
the desired texture or construction. During 2020, Shaw processed approximately 97% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own
yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials is adequate but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and natural gas
price changes. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers.
The soft floor covering industry is highly competitive with only a handful of key players domestically where the majority of
Shaw’s business occurs. There are numerous manufacturers, domestically and internationally, that are engaged in hard surface floor
covering production, distribution and sales. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 44% of the total
United States consumption of all flooring types. The principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality,
style, price and service.

valuable, however it does not consider any of its businesses to be materially dependent on any single patent or license. JM operates
over 40 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and China and conducts research and development at its technical center
in Littleton, Colorado and at other facilities in the U.S. and Europe.
Fiberglass is made from earthen raw materials and recycled glass, together with proprietary agents to bind many of its glass
fibers. JM’s products also contain materials other than fiberglass, including various chemical and petrochemical-based materials
used in roofing and other specialized products. JM uses recycled material when available and suitable to satisfy the broader needs
of its customers. The raw materials used in these various products are readily available in sufficient quantities from various sources
to maintain and expand its current production levels.
JM’s operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which regulate or
impose liability for the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances
and use of chemical substances generally. The most relevant of the federal laws are the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act,
the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,

manufacturing sites located in four states, three concrete block facilities and a quarrying operation all located in Texas. The demand
for Acme’s products is seasonal, with higher sales in the warmer weather months, and is subject to the level of construction activity,
which is cyclical. Acme also owns and leases properties and mineral rights that supply raw materials used in many of its
manufactured products. Acme’s raw materials supply is believed to be adequate.
The brick industry is subject to the EPA Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards (“MACT”). As required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act, the EPA developed a list of source categories that require the development of National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants, which are also referred to as MACT Standards (“Rule”). Key elements of the MACT Rule include
emission limits established for certain hazardous air pollutants and acidic gases. Acme’s brick plants are in compliance with the

U.S. grown cotton and polyester fibers are the main raw materials used in the manufacturing of FOL’s apparel products and
are purchased from a limited number of third-party suppliers. In 2015, FOL entered into an eight-year agreement with one key
supplier to provide the majority of FOL’s yarn. Management currently believes there are readily available alternative sources of raw
materials and yarn. However, if relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources
of supply, production could be adversely affected, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on results of operations.
Additionally, raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic
climate and other unpredictable factors. FOL has secured contracts to purchase cotton, either directly or through the yarn suppliers,
to meet a large percentage of its production plans for 2021. FOL’s markets are highly competitive, consisting of many domestic and
foreign manufacturers and distributors. Competition is generally based upon product features, quality, customer service and price.

Berkshire Hathaway Automotive
The Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Group, Inc. (“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States,
currently operating 104 new vehicle franchises through 81 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the
United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts,
vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party
lenders. BHA operates 29 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto
auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company.
Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 70% of dealership-
related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle
manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln,
Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these
manufacturers.
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership
groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via
the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume,
the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting
customers.
BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework
agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and the ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships.
Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing
those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer
that may be owned by BHA.
K-20
 
Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-
exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as
well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the
management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-
renewal for a variety of causes. The states generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection
to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or
with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law.
BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health
insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training
programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only
risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair
our business operations.
General Business Risks
Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses.
A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business
operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities
and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses.
Cyber security risks
We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our
information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-
service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more
sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety
failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users
and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and
expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.
K-22
 
Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery
planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new
technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and/or liquidity.
Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or
compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage
to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost
revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security,
repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could
materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism,
sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these
risks with all businesses.
We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.
Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board
of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 90, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
age 97. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a
material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire
managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett and has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a
replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement
for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our
numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed
Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s
insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for
major capital allocation and investment decisions.
We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses.
In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of
our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory
environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving
their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and
personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a
whole.
Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value.
We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small
number of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a
material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings.
Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair
values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our large statutory
surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability
ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits.
Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts,
which contain equity price risks. Most of the contracts remaining at year end 2020 will expire by February 2023. Risks of losses
under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major U.S. and international stock indexes.
We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity
securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that
equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in significant settlement payments upon contract expirations.
K-23
 
Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.
Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our
businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages,
many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our
future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive
advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline.
Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access
capital markets at a reasonable cost.
Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in
which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse
effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business
regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital
markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these
operations could be adversely affected.
Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses.
The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may
adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested
or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and
services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity
securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues,
regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of
banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all
of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our
operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot
predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
and/or cash flows.
Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These
regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems,
networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties.
Risks unique to our regulated businesses
Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.
When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single
event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event
resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined
underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid
writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. Currently,
we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10 billion. However,
despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies
are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage,
negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may
result in lower reported earnings in a future period.
K-24
 
The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may
result in significant underwriting losses.
The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty
insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades
before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that
liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages
provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our
estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($120.8 billion at
December 31, 2020), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings.
Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital.
Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to
among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that
must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing
and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance
regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active
insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes
in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may
adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.
Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to
rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to
comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change
the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects
that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and
implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures.
BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To
the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or
alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a
common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of
hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations.
Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to
make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or
liquidity.
Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign
governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to
new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly
apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including:
acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating
facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental
requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; transacting between our domestic
utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or
reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable
portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid
waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a
significant adverse impact on our financial results.
K-25
 
Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that
transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also
require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet
their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in
order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable
through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through
debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when
needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business,
including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts
issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal
and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its
subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and
penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press
releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-
looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking
statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which
include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any
statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business
strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking
statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events
and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the
industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no
specific intention to update these statements.
Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a
number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ
materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an
unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team
participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the
Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated beginning in the second half of March, most of our businesses were negatively
affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing,
service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter due to closures of
facilities where crowds gather, such as retail stores, restaurants and entertainment venues as well as from public travel restrictions
and from closures of certain of our businesses. In each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, several of these businesses
experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings as compared to the second quarter.
Our businesses that were deemed essential continued to operate through the pandemic, including our railroad, utilities and
energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, wholesale distribution and service businesses. In response to the effects of the
pandemic, our businesses implemented various business continuity plans to protect our employees and customers. Such plans
include a variety of actions, such as temporarily closing certain retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers of
businesses that were not subject to government mandated closure. Our businesses also implemented practices to protect employees
while at work. Such practices included work-from-home, staggered or reduced work schedules, increased cleaning and sanitation of
workspaces, providing employee health screenings, eliminating non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings and providing
general health reminders intended to lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.
We also took actions in response to the economic losses from reductions in consumer demand for products and services we
offer and our temporary inability to produce goods and provide services at certain of our businesses. These actions included
employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to help mitigate the
economic losses and preserve capital and liquidity. Certain of our businesses undertook and may continue to undertake
restructuring activities to resize their operations to better fit expected customer demand. We cannot reliably predict future economic
effects of the pandemic or when business activities at all of our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we
predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve.
Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $657 million in 2020, $325 million in 2019 and
$1.6 billion in 2018. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from
reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $750
million in 2020, $800 million in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2018. Underwriting results in 2020 also reflected the effects of the
pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger
automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business.
K-33
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Results of Operations (Continued)
After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2020 declined $491 million (8.9%) versus 2019, reflecting lower
interest income primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. After-
tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2019 increased 21.4% over 2018, attributable to increases in interest and
dividend income.
After-tax earnings of our railroad business decreased 5.8% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower
railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly
offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business
increased 8.8% as compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings
from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings in 2020 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined 11.4%
versus 2019. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic varied among our manufacturing businesses relative to significance and
duration.
Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $11.0 billion in 2020,
$435 million in 2019 and $3.0 billion in 2018. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz.
Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2020 also included after-tax
foreign exchange rate losses of $764 million related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based
finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).
After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from
higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost
control initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions
and severe winter weather in the first half of 2019. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.4% in 2019
compared to 2018.
Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018, reflecting
mixed operating results with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues
and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency
translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs.
Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented included significant gains and losses on our
investments in equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes on securities we continue to hold.
We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market
prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance
of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.
Insurance—Underwriting
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.
Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s
Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of
underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as
an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether
realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long
periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance
businesses.
The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,
particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax losses in excess of $100 million from a
current year catastrophic event to be significant.
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior
years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive
reinsurance contracts, were approximately $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our periodic underwriting results may also
include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar
denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
K-34
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Underwriting results in 2020 of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected by
estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible
premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic in the future may be
further affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its
effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time.
We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks.
Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance
Group (“BHRG”).
Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

2020 versus 2019
GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for 2020 reflected significant declines in losses and loss adjustment expenses
attributable to lower claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic offset by
the effects of the GEICO Giveback program (see following paragraph) on earned premiums.
Premiums written decreased 3.0% compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program provided for a 15% premium credit to
all voluntary auto and motorcycle policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, as well as to any new policies
written during the same period. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written in 2020 by approximately $2.9 billion.
Premiums earned decreased 1.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, which included reductions of approximately $2.5 billion attributable
to the GEICO Giveback program.
K-35
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
Voluntary auto policies-in-force at the end of 2020 increased approximately 820,000 (4.6%) compared to the end of 2019.
The increase reflected a 7.3% decrease in new business sales and a 2.5% decrease in non-renewals and policy cancellations.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. GEICO’s ratio of losses and
loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019.
The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact
of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program.
Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-
eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims
severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage
(twelve to thirteen percent range).
Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss
estimates for prior years’ loss events compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in
2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019.
Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related,
advertising and technology costs partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 (underwriting expenses to
premiums earned) was 16.1%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily
attributable to the decline in earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program.
2019 versus 2018
Premiums written and earned in 2019 increased 5.5% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were
primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.4%, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per
auto policy. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales and a
decrease in policies cancelled or not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,068,000 during 2019.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 10.1% compared to 2018. The loss ratio in 2019 was 81.3%, an
increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2018, primarily due to increases in average claims severities.
Average claims severities in 2019 were higher versus 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent
range) and bodily injury coverage (seven to nine percent range). Claims frequencies in 2019 declined compared to 2018 for
property damage and collision coverages (two to four percent range) and personal injury protection coverage (one to two percent
range) and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury coverage. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net increases of
$42 million in 2019 and net of decreases $222 million in 2018 for changes in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events.
Underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $493 million (10.6%) over 2018. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2019 was
14.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to
increases in advertising expenses and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases.

Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group
The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including
healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small,
medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire
Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”)
and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company,
Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”), acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH
Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
 
 2020   2019   2018  
 Amount  %   Amount  %   Amount  %  
Premiums written $10,212      $ 9,843      $ 8,561

Underwriting expenses  2,376   24.7   2,446   26.7   2,180   26.9 
Total losses and expenses  9,505   98.8   8,782   95.8   7,441   91.8 
Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 110      $ 383      $ 670    
 
 
Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH
Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers.
The increase at BH Specialty was driven by increased casualty business globally and the increase at MedPro Group reflected
increases across several product categories. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower
workers’ compensation and commercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October
2019. The declines in workers’ compensation and commercial auto business written reflected the effects of reduced exposures and
premium refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic and volume reductions attributable to increased price competition in the
market.
Premiums written increased $1.3 billion (15.0%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to higher volumes
from BH Specialty, MedPro Group and GUARD, as well as from the effects of the MLMIC acquisition. These increases were
partly offset by lower volume at BHHC and the effect of the Applied Underwriters divestiture.
BH Primary’s combined loss ratios were 74.1% in 2020, 69.1% in 2019 and 64.9% in 2018, which reflected the effects of
significant catastrophe events during the year and changes in estimated losses for prior years’ loss events. Losses and loss
adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $207 million in 2020 (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S.
wildfires) and $190 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California). We incurred no losses from
significant catastrophe events in 2019. Losses in 2020 also included $167 million attributable to the pandemic. Finally, losses and
loss adjustment expenses were reduced $265 million in 2020, $499 million in 2019 and $715 million in 2018 for net reductions in
estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events.
BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance
and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant
increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or
judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance
to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire
Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and
General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under
retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly
through BHLN.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in
establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the
liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and
discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A
summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Premiums written in 2020 increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to new
business, including a small number of contracts with very large premiums, and increased participations on renewals. Premiums
written in 2019 increased $1.0 billion (10.8%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to new business, net of
non-renewals, and increased participations on renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects
of a stronger U.S. Dollar.
Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.6 billion
(35.3%). The loss ratio in 2020 was 81.0%, an increase of 7.2 percentage points over 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in
2020 included estimated losses of $964 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and estimated losses from significant
catastrophe events of $667 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also
reflected net increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $162 million in 2020 primarily attributable to
legacy environmental, asbestos and other latent injury claims. Such amount as a percentage of the related net unpaid claim
liabilities as of the beginning of 2020 was 0.5%.
BHRG’s loss ratio was 73.8% in 2019 and 77.6% in 2018. Losses in 2019 included approximately $1.0 billion from
Typhoons Faxia and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, while losses in 2018 included approximately $1.3 billion
from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and wildfires in California. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also
included net decreases of $295 million in 2019 and $469 million in 2018 for prior years’ loss events. Such amounts as percentages
of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 1.0% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2018.
Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $533
million (20.6%) over 2019, and underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $376 million (17.0%) over 2018. The increases reflected
the increases in premium volumes and changes in business mix.

Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the
increase was attributable to a reinsurance contract covering U.S. health insurance risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019,
which was not renewed for 2021. The remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in the Asian and European life
reinsurance markets.
Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims
(approximately $275 million) and continuing losses from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions with respect
to disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-
term care business that is in run-off. The ratio of life and health insurance benefits to premiums earned was 83.3% in 2020 and
81.5% in 2019, which is before the effects of the BHLN contract amendment referred to below.
Life/health premiums written in 2019 decreased $467 million (8.6%) compared to 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN
amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums
on this contract in 2019 of $49 million, while premiums earned in 2018 related to this contract were $954 million. In 2019,
premiums earned also included $228 million from a new health reinsurance contract and reflected volume growth in life markets,
partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar.
Underwriting earnings in 2019 included a one-time gain of $163 million attributable to the BHLN yearly-renewable-term life
reinsurance contract amendment. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit
liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions increased U.S. long-
term care liabilities due to discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions, and an increase in life claims in
North America, partially offset by increased earnings from other international life business.
Retroactive reinsurance
There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in 2020. Premiums written were $684 million in 2019 and
$517 million in 2018, attributable to a limited number of contracts in each year. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived
from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results
also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S.
Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency losses of $139
million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019 and pre-tax gains of $169 million in 2018.
Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $1.1 billion in 2020, $1.2 billion in 2019 and $947
million in 2018. Overall, we decreased estimated ultimate liabilities $399 million in 2020 for prior years’ contracts compared to an
increase of $378 million in 2019. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated
timing and amount of the future claim payments, such changes produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately
$230 million in 2020 and pre-tax losses of $125 million in 2019.  
Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $41.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $42.4
billion at December 31, 2019. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $12.4 billion at
December 31, 2020 and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected
remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization.

Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Periodic payment annuity
Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2020 decreased $297 million (34.4%) compared to 2019, which decreased
$293 million (25.3%) from 2018. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due
to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected
annuity payments, as well as the level of competition.
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount
accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest
rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax
underwriting results included foreign currency losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in 2019 compared to pre-tax gains of
$93 million in 2018.
Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $550
million in 2020, $509 million in 2019 and $433 million in 2018. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount
accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as from the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities were
$14.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate was
approximately 4.0%.
Variable annuity
Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020 compared to pre-tax
earnings of $167 million in 2019 and $34 million in 2018. The results of this business reflect changes in remaining liabilities for
underlying guaranteed benefits reinsured, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the
periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts can be volatile, reflecting the volatility
of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Interest and other investment income declined $1.0 billion (49.0%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower
income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S.
Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and the decline continued throughout 2020, which
resulted in significantly lower interest income. We expect such rates, which are historically low, to remain low, negatively affecting
our earnings from such investments in 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist
on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Investment Income (Continued)
Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to
dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum
Corporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments.
Interest and other investment income increased $224 million (12.1%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher
interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties, partially offset by lower
income earned from fixed maturity securities and limited partnership investments. Dividend income increased $873 million
(23.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment levels,
including the investment in Occidental and increased dividends from common stock investments.
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net
liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit
liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance
receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float
approximated $138 billion at December 31, 2020, $129 billion at December 31, 2019 and $123 billion at December 31, 2018. Our
combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $838 million in 2020, $417 million in
2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for each of those periods was negative.

2020 versus 2019
Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease
in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by
lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which
severely impacted volumes through the first half of the year. Volumes sequentially improved from earlier periods and recovered
overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.  
BNSF is an important component of the national and global supply chain and, as an essential business, has continued to
operate throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic caused significant economic disruptions that
adversely affected the demand for transportation services. The pandemic continues to evolve, and the full extent to which it may
impact BNSF's business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments. We believe BNSF's
fundamental business remains strong and it has ample liquidity to continue business operations during this volatile period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued)
Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the
pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable
outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding
table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance
compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively
affected expenses and service levels in 2019.
Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a
6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of
the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail
sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half
of 2020.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was
primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased
primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy
sector, which drove lower sand and petroleum products volume, along with reduced steel demand, which drove lower taconite
volume.
Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was
due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to
higher grain and meal exports, partially offsetting adverse impacts of the pandemic, primarily for ethanol and sweeteners
shipments.
Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to
lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower
electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures.
Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating
expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses
in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved
weather conditions compared to 2019.
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower
employee counts associated with lower volume and due to improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion
(39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased
services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved
productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other
expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost
controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses.
2019 versus 2018
Railroad operating revenues were $22.7 billion in 2019, a decline of 1.1% versus 2018. During 2019, BNSF’s revenues
reflected a 3.6% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.5% decrease in volume. The increase in average
revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit and a favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing. Pre-
tax earnings were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 5.6% over 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and
flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. In addition to the impact of an
increase in average revenue per car/unit, earnings in 2019 benefited from a reduction in total operating expenses.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued)
Operating revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting
volume decreases and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the
availability of truck capacity, as well as lower west coast imports.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was
attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Volumes decreased primarily due to
overall softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes and reduced car loadings, due to the challenging weather conditions in
2019. Increased demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the other decreases in volumes.
Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was
due to lower volumes and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition from
non-U.S. sources, the impacts of international trade policies and the challenging weather conditions in 2019.
Operating revenues from coal decreased 7.4% in 2019 to $3.7 billion compared to 2018, reflecting lower average revenue
per car/unit and lower volumes. Volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, as well as from the effects of
lower natural gas prices.
Railroad operating expenses were $14.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of $535 million compared to 2018. Our ratio of operating
expenses to railroad operating revenues in 2019 of 64.5% decreased 1.7 percentage points versus 2018. Operating expenses in 2019
reflected lower volume-related costs, lower fuel prices and the effects of cost control initiatives, partially offset by the costs
associated with the adverse weather conditions.
Fuel expenses decreased $402 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes
and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower
purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, lower drayage, lower services expense and higher insurance
recoveries. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018, due to lower locomotive and
various other costs associated with lower volumes and cost controls. Other expenses, net decreased $221 million compared to 2018.
In 2019, other expenses were net of a $120 million curtailment gain from an amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit
retirement plans.

Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued)
2020 versus 2019
PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming.
PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses
and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-
service, higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses
was largely due to costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits.
PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected
higher operating revenue from favorable average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by
lower operating revenue from a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the
impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather.
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $37
million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits,
driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by
higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower
electric and natural gas utility margins.
MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin
decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail
sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a
1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by
certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020
compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather.
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020
compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of
ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings
sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-
service.
NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was
primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only
service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was
primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic.
Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected
write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate
income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense.
Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to
$73 million of earnings from the BHE GT&S acquisition, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas
and higher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses.
Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to
increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation,
partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued)
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher
earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher
refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an
increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily
due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits.
2019 versus 2018
PacifiCorp after-tax earnings were $773 million in 2019, an increase of $34 million compared to 2018, reflecting slightly
higher utility margin and higher other income, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service.
PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $4 million compared to 2018, as a 0.4% increase in retail
customer volumes was largely offset by lower wholesale revenue mainly due to lower volumes.
MEC after-tax earnings of $781 million in 2019 increased $112 million as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to
increases in electric utility margin, income tax benefits from higher production tax credits and the effects of ratemaking and other
income. Electric utility margin in 2019 increased 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher wind generation and higher retail
customer volumes of 1.4%, as a 4.0% increase in industrial volumes was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the
unfavorable impacts of weather. These earnings increases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from additional
assets placed in-service (net of lower Iowa revenue sharing) and higher net interest expense.
NV Energy after-tax earnings were $365 million in 2019, an increase of $48 million compared to 2018, as lower operating
expenses were partly offset by lower electric utility margin. Electric utility margin in 2019 was $1.6 billion, representing a decrease
of $58 million (3%) versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes, largely attributable
to the impacts of weather, and rate reductions from the impact of the changes in U.S. income tax laws, partially offset by retail
customer growth.
Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting higher distribution revenues and lower
operating expenses, which were largely from lower pension settlement losses in 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign
currency translation effects of a strong average U.S. Dollar. Distribution revenues increased $18 million, attributable to higher tariff
rates, partly offset by lower distributed units.
Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $35 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher
transportation revenues from generally higher volumes and rates, favorable margins from system balancing activities and a
decrease in operating expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from increased spending on capital projects.
Other energy businesses after-tax earnings in 2019 increased $119 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due
to improved earnings from renewable wind energy projects ($49 million from tax equity investments and $25 million from new and
existing projects and activities), higher income from geothermal and natural gas units, largely due to higher generation and
favorable margins and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower earnings at a hydroelectric facility in the Philippines due to
lower rainfall. The increase in earnings also reflected the effects of favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the
unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink L.P.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher
earnings at mortgage businesses due to increased refinance activity and earnings attributable to recent business acquisitions,
partially offset by lower earnings at brokerage businesses, primarily from a decrease in closed units and lower margins.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $155 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings decline was
primarily due to income tax benefits recognized in 2018 related to the reduction of accrued repatriation taxes on undistributed
foreign earnings in connection with the changes in U.S. income tax laws, higher interest expense and lower earnings from non-
regulated energy services.

Industrial products
The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products
for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC
International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB
International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty
Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment
leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined
$1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019.
PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. Historically, a significant
portion of PCC’s earnings have been dependent on sales related to the aerospace industry. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to
material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of
aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft
manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production
issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant
declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. In 2020, PCC’s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2%,
primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were $650 million, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in
aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects
of the pandemic, PCC has taken aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in
aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% since the end of 2019. PCC recorded charges for
restructuring and inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Although earnings as a percentage of
revenues were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates,
the restructuring actions taken contributed to improved margins in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in the year and further
margin improvements are expected in the future. The level of aircraft production is currently expected to slowly increase beginning
in the latter half of 2021. However, this is dependent of the timing and extent that COVID-19 infections are lowered on a sustained
basis and the return to historical levels of air travel and subsequent demand for aerospace products.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable
to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in
Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020
also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume for the year
declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019, due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by
higher volumes in Life Science products. Overall, the effects of the pandemic on Lubrizol were more pronounced in the first half of
the year, as volumes rebounded significantly in the second half.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of
lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw
material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire.
Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of
business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all sectors, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the
pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies sectors. Additionally,
revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services sector and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines
in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) as compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the
declines in revenues, increased restructuring charges and lower interest income. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response
to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Industrial products (Continued)
IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on
demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions over the past year. IMC’s
pre-tax earnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to
changes in sales mix.
2019 versus 2018
Revenues of the industrial products group were slightly lower in 2019 than in 2018 and pre-tax earnings declined 3.2%
compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 18.4% in 2019 compared to 19.0% in 2018.
PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. In 2019, PCC generated
increased sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets. The increase in aerospace
sales was tempered due to significant efforts focused on the ramp-up requirements for certain new aerospace programs, such as
LEAP, that created manufacturing inefficiencies and slowed production cycles contributing to delays in product deliveries and
sales.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting increased sales of aerospace products and
higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the power markets
due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press outages also negatively
impacted earnings in 2018. PCC incurred incremental costs in 2019 to meet required deliveries to customers associated with the
increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were
primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for newer, complex aerospace
products.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of 5.2% compared to 2018. The decline reflected lower volumes,
including the effects from the Rouen fire, and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average
selling prices which were necessitated by raw material cost increases. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in 2019 declined 4% from
2018, primarily due to volume decline of 6% in the Additives product lines.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year decreased 50.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to
the same periods in 2018. Earnings in 2019 were significantly impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire.
Lubrizol’s operating results in 2019 were also negatively affected by lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing expenses and
unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by improved material margins.
Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase
reflected the effects of business acquisitions, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely offset by lower
distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of lower metal prices in
the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition of the Colson
Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors
benefitted from higher railcar equipment sales, railcar fleet utilization, railcar repair services, intermodal container leasing revenue
and improved crane rental demand in the U.S. and Australia.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2019 (1.0%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected the
effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by lower gains from business divestitures. Earnings in 2019 also reflected increased
earnings in sectors that experienced sales volume increases, which were substantially offset by lower earnings in the Metal Services
and certain other sectors, the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and increased interest and other expenses.
IMC’s revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a
stronger U.S. Dollar and lower sales in several regions, including Asia and Europe, mostly offset by increased revenues from recent
business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.8% in 2019 versus 2018, attributable to unfavorable foreign currency
translation effects, changes in business mix to lower margin items and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes.

Building products
The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial
services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry
products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and
engineering products and systems (MiTek).
2020 versus 2019
Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings
increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The
increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per
home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home
increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage
services, insurance and interest income from lending activities increased 13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased
loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately
$17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared
to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered
manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense
and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6%
versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, partly attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, partly offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware
Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets.
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over
2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower
facilities closure costs.
2019 versus 2018
Revenues of the building products group in 2019 increased $1.65 billion (8.8%) compared to 2018, while pre-tax earnings
increased 12.8% over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.0% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2018.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The
comparative increase was primarily due to a 26% increase in home sales, reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales
mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 84% in 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while average prices
declined 5%. Manufactured home unit retail sales increased 5% and wholesale sales were 9% lower in 2019. Interest income from
lending activities increased 6.7% in 2019 compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average outstanding loan
balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $14.7 billion
as of December 31, 2018.
Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings were $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $182 million (20.0%) compared to 2018. The
increase was attributable to home building activities, which benefitted from the increases in home sales, and to financial services
activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in interest income
attributable to higher average loan balances, increased earnings from other financial services and lower credit losses, partially offset
by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher other operating costs.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $13.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% versus 2018.
Revenues increased for paint and coatings, hard surface flooring and roofing products, attributable to a combination of increased
volumes, product mix changes and increased average selling prices, while sales of brick products declined.

Building products (Continued)
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $1.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.2% over 2018.
Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material
costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities
closure costs.
Consumer products
The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including
Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries
(Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline).
2020 versus 2019
Consumer products revenues increased of $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146
million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%.
The comparative increase in revenues reflected revenue increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower
apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a
significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second
half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019,
reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020
compared to 2019.
Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects
of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain
manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and
inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019
that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility.
The comparative increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by
lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense
management efforts.
2019 versus 2018
Consumer products revenues declined $718 million (5.7%) in 2019 versus 2018, driven by a 12.9% revenue decline from
Forest River, primarily due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 1.3% and apparel and footwear revenues declined
1.1% compared to 2018. Although revenues from Brooks Sports increased 3.5% in 2019, its operating results were negatively
affected by lost sales associated with problems encountered at a distribution center that opened in the second quarter. In addition,
our other apparel and other footwear businesses continue to experience lower sales volumes for certain products, reflecting the shift
by major retailers towards private label products.
Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $43 million (3.6%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily
attributable to continuing cost containment efforts across several of the businesses and the effects of a new Duracell product launch,
partially offset by the impact of lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River.

Service
Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology
training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and
service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the
petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA)
and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of
a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG).
2020 versus 2019
Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million
(4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020 compared to 12.5% in 2019.
The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting
lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in flight
hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The comparative
service group revenue decline was also attributable to the effects of the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020
and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the effects of the pandemic. Partially offsetting
these declines were revenue increases at TTI and at WPLG.
The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and from the effects of the divestiture of the
newspaper operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline
reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample
inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring
costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was
driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the
effects of contract losses recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which
more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services.

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Service (Continued)
2019 versus 2018
Service group revenues increased $163 million (1.2%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increased sales at
TTI and higher aviation-related services revenues (NetJets and FlightSafety), partially offset by decreases from the media
businesses and Charter Brokerage. TTI’s sales increased 2% in 2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. TTI’s
sales slowed throughout 2019, attributable to softening customer demand, lower average selling prices and the effects of U.S. trade
tariffs. The increase in NetJets’ revenues in 2019 reflected increased lease revenue, primarily attributable to an increase in aircraft
on lease, and increased flight hours, partly offset by lower revenue from prepaid flight cards. The revenue decline at Charter
Brokerage was attributable to the divesture of a high revenue, low margin business in mid-2019.
Pre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $155 million (8.4%) compared to 2018. The comparative earnings decline
was primarily due to lower earnings from TTI and FlightSafety, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets. TTI’s earnings
decline was primarily attributable to lower gross margins, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating
expenses. The earnings decline at FlightSafety was attributable to pre-tax losses of approximately $165 million recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with an existing government contract, partly offset by lower training equipment impairment
charges. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved fleet and operating
efficiencies, which improved operating margins.
Retailing
Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that
sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products and represented 62.6% of our combined retailing
revenue in 2020. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products
distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey,
Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represented 20.6% of the combined
retailing revenues in 2020.
Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies
(confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies
and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany.
2020 versus 2019
Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the
U.S. resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer
spending patterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations.
BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-
owned vehicle sales of 2.6% as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially
unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to restricted
store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply chain
disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels.
The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candy and Oriental
Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales volumes
generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly
reopened.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Retailing (Continued)
Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%,
primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales
margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019,
reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower
earnings from our other retailing operations.
Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher
average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions, and from lower advertising and other operating
expenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020,
while others, including See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects
of the pandemic.
2019 versus 2018
Retailing group revenues increased $385 million (2.5%) in 2019 compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues increased 4.1% in 2019
over 2018, primarily attributable to an 11.5% increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, vehicle pricing increases, improvement in
vehicle finance and service contract activities and vehicle repair work as compared to 2018. New vehicle sales in 2019 were
relatively unchanged from 2018. Home furnishings group revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 compared to 2018, as sales were
relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations.
Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $14 million (1.6%) in 2019 over 2018. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 22.7%,
primarily due to the increases in earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest
expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings declined 14.7% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and generally
higher operating expenses.
McLane Company
McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and
convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors
of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit
margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales
comprised about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2020 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A
curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19 related
restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product
categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53
weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as
compared to 2019.
Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of
increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the
impact of lower sales. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting
its current operating results. We expect that these operating conditions will continue.
2019 versus 2018
Revenues increased $471 million (0.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. McLane’s results in 2019 included 53 weeks compared
to 52 weeks in 2018. Otherwise, revenues decreased roughly 3% in the grocery business and increased 3% in the foodservice
business in 2019 as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $42 million (17.1%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase
in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset by increased operating
expenses, the largest portion of which was employee costs.

Investment gains (losses)
We are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity
securities in earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity
securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of
approximately $55.0 billion in 2020 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at December 31, 2020 and
net losses of approximately $14.0 billion from changes in market prices during 2020 on securities sold during 2020. We recorded
pre-tax unrealized investment gains of approximately $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market prices in 2019 on
equity securities we held at December 31, 2019. Pre-tax unrealized investment losses of approximately $22.7 billion were recorded
in 2018 attributable to market price changes in 2018 on equity securities we held at December 31, 2018. Taxable investment gains
on equity securities sold, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $6.2
billion in 2020, $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018.
We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often
meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We
continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in
any given period has little analytical or predictive value.
Derivative gains (losses)
Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which
relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The
periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility
of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2020, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $727
million and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $1.1 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our
contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts.
Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax losses of $159 million in 2020, pre-tax gains of $1.5 billion in 2019 and
pre-tax losses of $300 million in 2018. These gains and losses reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining
contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties were relatively insignificant in each of the three years.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Other (Continued)
After-tax equity method earnings (losses) include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft
Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $170 million in 2020 and
$488 million in 2019 and our after-tax losses were $1,859 million in 2018. Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax
share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such
charges was $611 million in 2020, $339 million in 2019 and approximately $2.7 billion in 2018.
After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in
connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment
of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020
included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were
recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Critical Accounting Policies on page K-63 for additional details.
Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion
par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥625.5 billion par), and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt (£1.75 billion
par). Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into
U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the
inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The income tax expense adjustments relate to investments that were made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity
investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018, we first learned of
allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent conduct by the sponsor of these funds. In January 2020, the principals involved in
creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. In the first quarter of 2019, we
concluded that it is more likely than not that the previously recognized income tax benefits were not valid.
Financial Condition
Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $443.2 billion, an increase of $18.4 billion since December 31, 2019, which was
net of common stock repurchases of $24.7 billion. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $42.5 billion and
included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $31.7 billion. During each of the last three years, changes in the
market prices of our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our earnings. Our results in 2020 also
included after-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairments charges of $11.0 billion.
At December 31, 2020, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $135.0
billion, which included $112.8 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our
investment in Kraft Heinz) were $301.6 billion.
Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $22.7 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion since
December 31, 2019. In 2020, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of €1.0 billion and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes
due in 2025. Berkshire also issued ¥195.5 billion of senior notes (approximately $1.8 billion) with a weighted average interest rate
of 1.07% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060. In the first quarter of 2021, senior notes of $1.7 billion will mature,
including $665 million (€550 million) that matured in January. In January 2021, Berkshire issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes
due in 2041.
Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $18.9 billion at December 31, 2020,
which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s
borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our
railcar leasing business. In 2020, BHFC repaid $900 million of maturing senior notes and issued $3.0 billion of senior notes with
maturity dates ranging from 2030 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely
payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In January 2021, $750 million of BHFC debt matured and
BHFC issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051.
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets
(property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital
expenditures of these two operations were $9.8 billion in 2020 and we forecast a similar amount of capital expenditures in 2021.
K-57
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Financial Condition (Continued)
BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior
unsecured debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.2 billion at December 31, 2020,
an increase of $9.6 billion since December 31, 2019. In 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately
$7.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and repaid approximately $3.2 billion of debt. BHE also assumed $5.6
billion in debt in connection with the business acquired from Dominion Energy in November 2020. Berkshire does not guarantee
the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF,
BHE or any of their subsidiaries.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program as amended permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at
prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open
market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The
program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s
consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity
will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In 2020, Berkshire paid $24.7 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and
B common stock.
Contractual Obligations
We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to
counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which
require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the
acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the financial
statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of
the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will
likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary,
perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table.

Critical Accounting Policies
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of
uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based
on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that
required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2020 follows.
Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim
liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The
timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds
and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of
techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions.
As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include liabilities for reported claims and for claims not yet reported.
The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively
short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty
claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial
process further contribute to extending claim-tails.
Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $120.8 billion (including liabilities from
retroactive reinsurance), of which 83% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information
regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows.
GEICO
GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2020, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses
were $22.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $21.8 billion.
GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions
affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”).
We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.
Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal
injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of
December 31, 2020, case development liabilities averaged approximately 33% of the case reserves. We select case development
factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.
Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected
(reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the
ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims.
We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR
liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.
We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models
and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period
and projects the ultimate cost.
Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2019 were reduced by $253 million during 2020, which produced a
corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2020 reflect the most
recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and
severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.
K-59
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least
one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2020. We estimate that a one
percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $300 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities,
with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to
differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued
through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other
than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions).
 
  Property   Casualty   Total  
Reported case liabilities  $ 5,714  $ 9,497  $ 15,211 
IBNR liabilities   5,821   14,615   20,436 
Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   11,535   24,112   35,647 
Reinsurance recoverable   181   864   1,045 
Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  $ 11,354  $ 23,248  $ 34,602
 
 
Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written
primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business
written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to
property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.
In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received
from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms,
conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.
The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess
contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information is often
less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts and is often in a summary format rather than on an
individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently
provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers.
Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally
required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S.,
reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of
the annual period. Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further delay the reporting
of claims. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual
reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons.
As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a
risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal
procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our
reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the
ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims
are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot
be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes
at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or
financial condition.
K-60
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We
generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if
appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2020, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding
company estimates by approximately $800 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago.
We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.
Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of
actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data
and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and
management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices,
inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of
the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:
Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development
patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to,
changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy
terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that
result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.
Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected
patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected
unpaid or unreported losses.
Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the
anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and
techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated
with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.
Additional Analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis,
determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an
anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to
reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected
loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include
estimates of known major catastrophe events.
Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and
incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual
risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for
estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the
individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.
For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the
business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid
or incurred development pattern indications.
In 2020, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated
ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $160 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss
emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities,
producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at
these rates.
K-61
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, the overall change in estimates
for prior years’ events was not significant in 2020. However, the potential for significant changes in future periods remains. For
certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the
expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a
corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $900
million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under
retroactive reinsurance contracts increased $468 million in 2020, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings.
Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Loss estimations for these exposures are
difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or
claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.
Retroactive reinsurance
Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities
relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-
tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2020, gross unpaid losses were $41.0 billion and deferred charge assets were $12.4
billion.
Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum
remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative
changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop
upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability.
We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our
liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various
scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor
subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying
losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are
revealed.
Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated
liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed
data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or
aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of
ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends
and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory
environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact
on our ultimate liabilities.
We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020, which
after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $230 million. In 2020, we paid losses and loss
adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Retroactive reinsurance (Continued)
In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception
represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred
charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss
payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments.
Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of
periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2020, we currently estimate that amortization expense in
2021 will approximate $1.1 billion.
Other Critical Accounting Policies
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.7 billion and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an
interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our
reporting units and intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues
and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by
management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent
subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary
materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged
to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit,
then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for
impairment during the second quarter of 2020. We determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate goodwill for impairment
for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment
charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million of which approximately $10
billion related to PCC.
Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of goodwill related to PCC was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the
carrying value of PCC’s indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were
recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial
airlines and aircraft manufacturers is particularly severe. We considered a number of factors in our reevaluation, including but not
limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders,
announcements by manufacturers on reduced aircraft production, and the actions we are taking or may take to restructure our
operations to fit lower expected demand. In our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and
aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide-scale distribution of medicines and vaccines that effectively
treat the virus. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior
long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments.
As of December 31, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
was not impaired. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time is and will likely be significantly affected by
assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot
reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. The effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and could lead us to record additional goodwill or
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2021.
We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions
and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an
appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting
unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.

Market Risk Disclosures
Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market
risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable
volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.
Equity Price Risk
Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses
that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee.
Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2020, approximately 68% of the
total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four issuers.
We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur
in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety
against short-term price volatility.
We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. Our ultimate liability with
respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and
expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as
interest rates and the remaining duration of the contracts.
The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of
those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results
from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our
equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Interest Rate Risk
We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such
instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of
business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit
ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage
interest rate risks.
The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will
fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index
put option contract models cause changes in the reported liabilities. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into
decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be
affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the
instrument and other general market conditions.
The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and
liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We assumed that the interest rate changes
occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to
determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios.
Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk
Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. In addition, we
hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency
risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to
manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way.
Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy
and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in
foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses in net earnings related to
certain liabilities of Berkshire and U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in
exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in
millions).

Commodity Price Risk
Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price
risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and
services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our
operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any
significant degree.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 as required by
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’
equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
K-67
 
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( “claim liabilities ”) under short duration property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance contracts are $79,854 million as of December 31, 2020. The key assumptions affecting certain claim
liabilities include expected loss and expense ( “loss ”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment
emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were
appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2020, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,
including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions.
• We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by:
 • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned
premium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.
 • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential
bias in the determination of the claim liabilities.
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
 • We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as
needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.
 • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the
reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the
financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactive reinsurance
contracts are $40,966 million as of December 31, 2020. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities and related deferred
charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”) include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected loss payment
emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were
appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2020, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,
including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities and related assets included the following, among
others:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities and related assets, including those over the key
assumptions.
K-68
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)
• We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities and related assets by:
 • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the
inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.
 • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential
bias in the determination of the claim liabilities and related assets.
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
 • We developed independent claim liability estimates for certain retroactive reinsurance contracts and compared our
estimates to management’s estimates. For other retroactive reinsurance contracts and related assets, we evaluated the
process used by management to develop the estimated claim liabilities and related assets.
 • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates, assessed
unexpected development and assessed internal rates of return.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair
value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of
each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests.
The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair
value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings
before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair
value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $31 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company performed an interim reevaluation of
the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at the PCC reporting unit. This determination was made due to disruptions
arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that had an adverse impact on the industries in which PCC operates. As a result of the
reevaluation, the Company recognized goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the amount of
approximately $10 billion, as the fair values of the PCC reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their
respective carrying values. As a result, PCC reported goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $21 billion as
of December 31, 2020.
Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the PCC reporting unit and certain customer
relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit
procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and
EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including
the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the PCC reporting
unit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others:
 • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the
forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate.
 • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year forecasts to
actual results in the respective years.
 • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts to
historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’
disclosures.
 • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth rates and
discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and
developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates and discount rate selected
by management.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices
 (a)Nature of operations and basis of consolidation
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse
business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing,
service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 27. Information concerning business
acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and
Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures
and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the
accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date.
Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable
interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its
economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right
to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
 (b)Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in
projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges
on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the
estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect
our operating businesses in March. COVID-19 has since adversely affected nearly all of our operations, although the effects
are varying significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this
time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial
condition include the time necessary to distribute safe and effective vaccines and to vaccinate a significant number of people
in the U.S. and throughout the world as well as the long-term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our
products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those
associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit
losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may
be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.  
 (c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills
Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments (including U.S. Treasury
Bills) with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S.
Treasury Bills with maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (d)Investments in fixed maturity securities
We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities
classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity.
Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes
in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
Substantially all of these investments are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original
cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method.
We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold, as
determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for
the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. Otherwise, we evaluate as of the
balance sheet date whether the unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of
the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses,
limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, along with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of
estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased
or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related
to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income.
 (e)Investments in equity securities
We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values
in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains/losses.
 (f) Investments under the equity method
We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence,
but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is
presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be
overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is
restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other
investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock.
In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying
amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the
investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event
that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments
in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity
method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value.
 (g)Receivables
Receivables primarily consist of balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses
recoverable. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with
stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts
ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance
recoverables relate to claims for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and
claim benefits under life and health insurance contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible
balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectible balances when it was probable counterparties or customers
would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and historical loss history.
As of January 1, 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for
credit losses. See Note 1(w). In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to
reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from
historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses, we review the credit
quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit
enhancement including, collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the
allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
K-76
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (h)Loans and finance receivables
Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to lesser extent, commercial loans and site-
built home loans. We carry substantially all of these loans at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses,
based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs
paid or fees received along with acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the
loans.
Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts
and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection,
whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured housing installment loans are based on the
net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected
uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is
whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates,
historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from
last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts.
Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due
on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to
the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than
90 days delinquent.
Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of
foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is
complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the
collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the
future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan.
 (i) Derivatives
We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under
master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify
as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities
subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable.
 (j) Fair value measurements
As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists.
Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair
value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be
independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance
or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting
market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.
 (k)Inventories
Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale.
Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2020, we
used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 35% of consolidated inventories with the remainder
primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost
or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately
$1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $950 million as of December 31, 2019.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (l) Property, plant and equipment
We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions,
improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as
certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed
assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized
costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance
the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property,
extend useful lives or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods
where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a
composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or
salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is
recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.
We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to estimated salvage value primarily using
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other
businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and
furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad
business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other
equipment – 6 to 43 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses
are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets
– 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 3 to 40 years.
We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering
event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value
from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable
amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to
impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in
evaluating the carrying value.
 (m)Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property from
others (“lessee” contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We
depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance deprecation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power
of the asset is relatively greater during the earlier years of its life and maintenance and repair costs increase during the later
years. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment.
When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate.
The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms
that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use
assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates
are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (n)Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that
business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the
fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market
quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected
future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including
goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair
values and performing goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with
finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the
estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
 (o)Revenue recognition
We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss
exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, such premiums are earned
ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on
retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events
covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are earned
when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-
rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts.
Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is
transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we
expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.
We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts
provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under
the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may
contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance
obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or
service.
Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may
be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed
to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue
excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for
shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat
consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue.
Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the
customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement.
We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings,
forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the
customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the
customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract.
K-79
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (o)Revenue recognition (Continued)
Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory
commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and
have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is
delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business.
Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the
customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due
within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual
arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance
obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator,
certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued.
The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a
point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series
of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are
based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which
are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing
quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified
destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously
receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as
of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within
30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping
to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future
customer shipments.
Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time,
where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services, or at a point in time when the services are
provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management,
aviation training and franchising and news distribution services.
Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the
terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our leases are classified as operating leases.
 (p)Losses and loss adjustment expenses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance
contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated
ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value.
We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and
(3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment
expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance
contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect
to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts.
 (q)Retroactive reinsurance contracts
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance
contracts consistent with other short duration property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p).
With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts,
representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently
amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the
estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in
such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are
included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (r) Insurance policy acquisition costs
We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate
recoverability, and we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Direct
incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts.
We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs
generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were
approximately $3.25 billion and $2.95 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 (s) Life and annuity insurance benefits
We compute liabilities for insurance benefits under life contracts based upon estimated future investment yields,
expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates, as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and
expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and
may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate
assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit
rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates for
most contracts range from 3% to 7%.
 (t) Regulated utilities and energy businesses
Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated
operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the
requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain
costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities
will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods.
Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by
considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated
entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory
rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers.
 (u)Foreign currency
The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other
than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars
at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the
reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated
in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of
assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings.
 (v)Income taxes
Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In
addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax
liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for
the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax
bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with
components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise,
changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on
deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax
expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is
not likely.

 (v)Income taxes (Continued)
Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax
returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of
the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax
expense.
 (w)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1,
2020. ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost
based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for
non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when
non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. We do not measure an allowance
for expected credit losses on accrued interest and instead, as permitted, we elected to reverse uncollectible accrued interest
through interest income on a timely basis. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $388
million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our
manufactured housing loans.
 (x)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019
Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a
liability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past
lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not
recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with
respect to contracts in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements.
Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $6.2 billion and
lease liabilities of $5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $300 million. Consequently, our consolidated
assets and liabilities increased by approximately $5.9 billion. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for
our lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases.
 (y)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2018
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” ASU 2018-02 “Reclassification of Certain Tax
Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Prior
year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02
and ASC 606 on our shareholders’ equity follows (in millions).
 
  ASU 2016-01  ASU 2018-02  ASC 606  Total  
Increase (decrease):                 
Accumulated other comprehensive income  $(61,459) $ 84  $ —  $(61,375)
Retained earnings   61,459   (84)  (70)  61,305 
Shareholders’ equity   —   —   (70)  (70)
 
In adopting ASU 2016-01, as of January 1, 2018, we reclassified the net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities
from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Thereafter, the unrealized gains and losses from the
changes during the period in the fair values of our equity securities are included within investment gains/losses in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified certain deferred income tax effects as of
January 1, 2018 attributable to the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain
assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings.

 (z) New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2020
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration
Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value
policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects
of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in
other comprehensive income. Under current GAAP, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract
inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the
effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Business acquisitions
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and
able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial
Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.  
In July 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) reached a definitive agreement with Dominion Energy, Inc.
(“Dominion”) to acquire substantially all of Dominion’s natural gas transmission and storage business. On October 5, 2020, BHE
and Dominion also agreed, as permitted under the acquisition agreement, to provide for the acquisition of all originally agreed upon
businesses, except for certain pipeline assets (the “Excluded Assets”) and entered into a second acquisition agreement with respect
to the Excluded Assets. The acquisition of the Dominion businesses, other than the Excluded Assets, was completed on November
1, 2020 and included more than 5,400 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, about 420 billion cubic
feet of operated natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility
(“Cove Point”). Under the terms of the second acquisition agreement, BHE agreed to acquire the Excluded Assets for
approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The closing of this second acquisition is subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals and
other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the first half of 2021.
The cost of the acquisition completed on November 1, 2020, was approximately $2.5 billion after post-closing adjustments
as provided in the agreement. The preliminary fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill
are summarized as follows (in millions).
 
Property, plant and equipment $ 9,254 
Goodwill  1,732 
Other  2,376 
Assets acquired $ 13,362 
    
Notes payable and other borrowings $ 5,615 
Other  1,317 
Liabilities assumed  6,932 
Noncontrolling interests  3,916 
Net assets $ 2,514
 
 
As part of this acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25% economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100% of the general
partnership interest and 25% of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that we have the power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and receive
benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary. The noncontrolling
interests in the preceding table is attributable to the limited partner interests held by third parties.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”), a writer of medical professional liability
insurance domiciled in New York. The acquisition price was approximately $2.5 billion. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of
MLMIC’s assets was approximately $6.1 billion, primarily investments ($5.2 billion), and the fair value of its liabilities was
approximately $3.6 billion, primarily unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ($3.2 billion).

(2)Business acquisitions (Continued)  
In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as “bolt-
ons” to several of our existing business operations. Aggregate consideration paid for bolt-on acquisitions, net of cash acquired was
approximately $130 million in 2020, $1.7 billion in 2019 and $1.0 billion in 2018. We do not believe that these acquisitions are
material, individually or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

On August 8, 2019, Berkshire invested a total of $10 billion in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) newly issued
Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion and warrants to purchase up to
80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $62.50 per share. In accordance with the terms of the
warrants, on August 3, 2020, the number of shares of common stock that can be purchased was increased to 83.86 million shares
and the exercise price was reduced to $59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable
at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference plus any
accumulated and unpaid dividends, or is mandatorily redeemable under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the
preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable
in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Our investments in Occidental are included in the
commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding tables.
(5)Equity method investments
Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method.
Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft
Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces,
cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152
shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6% of the outstanding shares.

(5)Equity method investments (Continued)
We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $95 million in 2020, $493 million in 2019 and
losses of approximately $2.7 billion in 2018. Equity method earnings (losses) included the effects of goodwill and identifiable
intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our share of such charges was approximately $850 million in 2020,
$450 million in 2019 and $3.7 billion in 2018. We received dividends from Kraft Heinz of $521 million in each of 2020 and 2019
and $814 million in 2018, which we recorded as reductions in our carrying value.
Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $11.3
billion at December 31, 2020 and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our investment was approximately
$13.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our
investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $2.0 billion (15% of carrying value). In light of this fact,
we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the
available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz, our ability and intent to hold the investment until
recovery, the relative amount of the decline and the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value, we concluded that
recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is
possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in a future period based on changes in facts and circumstances or
intentions.

Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage
LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our
investments in these entities was approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Our equity method earnings in these entities were $631 million in 2020, $683 million in 2019 and $563 million in 2018. Additional
information concerning these investments follows.
We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia
is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S.
government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial
institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to
$1.5 billion. On December 31, 2020, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. The commercial paper is
supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any
losses incurred under the policy.
A Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50% interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric
transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50% interest.
On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a
38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America,
supplying more than 11 billion gallons of fuel per year via more than 950 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian
provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot and a third party owns
the remaining 11.3% interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot with the
Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity
securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $38.8 billion in 2020, $14.3 billion in 2019 and $18.8 billion in
2018 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold reflect the difference
between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if
later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold during the year, which are generally the difference between the proceeds from
sales and our original cost, were $6.2 billion in 2020, $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018.

(12)Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. As a lessee, we primarily lease office and operating facilities,
locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets were $5,579
million and lease liabilities were $5,469 million at December 31, 2020. Operating lease right-of-use assets were $5,941 million and
lease liabilities were $5,882 million at December 31, 2019. Such amounts were included in other assets and accounts payable,
accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The weighted average term of these leases was approximately 7.3
years at December 31, 2020 and 7.7 years at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate used to measure lease
liabilities was approximately 3.6% at December 31, 2020 and 3.8% at December 31, 2019. A summary of our remaining operating
lease payments as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).

Intangible asset amortization expense was $1,277 million in 2020, $1,317 million in 2019 and $1,393 million in 2018.
Estimated amortization expense over the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2021 – $1,262; 2022 – $1,190; 2023 – $1,108;
2024 – $986 and 2025 – $906. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $19.0 billion
as of December 31, 2019 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names.
During 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our
reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believed that the most significant
of these disruptions related to the air travel and commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded pre-tax goodwill
impairment charges of approximately $10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million
in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest
business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $31 billion.
The impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flow methods and reflected our assessments of the risks
and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting
unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results in the
future may vary significantly from the forecasts.
(14)Derivative contracts
We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. The most significant derivative contracts consist of
equity index put option contracts. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions).
 
  December 31,  
  2020   2019  
Balance sheet liabilities - at fair value  $ 1,065  $ 968

Intrinsic value   727   397 
Weighted average remaining life (in years)   1.2   1.8
  
The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes.
Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index
is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the
index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Substantially all open contracts as of December 31,
2020 will expire by February 2023.
K-91
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(14)Derivative contracts (Continued)
Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike
price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $1.9 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to
unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2020 and we have no counterparty credit risk.  
We recorded derivative contract losses of $159 million in 2020, gains of $1,484 million in 2019 and losses of $300 million in
2018, with respect to our equity index put option contracts. These gains and losses were primarily due to changes in the equity
index values. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount
of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates.
Our regulated utility subsidiaries may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of
their commodity price risks. Most of these net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of
recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets.
 
(15)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and
casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences
as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in
claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 16), for each of the three years ending
December 31, 2020 is as follows (in millions).

Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured
events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”).
Current accident year losses included approximately $950 million in 2020, $1.0 billion in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018 from
significant catastrophe events occurring in each year. Current accident year losses in 2020 also reflected the effects of low private
passenger automobile claims frequencies and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and reinsurance business
attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $356 million in 2020, $752 million in
2019 and $1,406 million in 2018, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These
reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.5% in 2020, 1.1% in 2019 and 2.4% in 2018.
K-92
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(15)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $518 million in 2020,
$457 million in 2019 and $937 million in 2018. The decrease in 2020 was primarily attributable to reductions for private passenger
automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases for other casualty claims.
The decrease in 2019 reflected reductions in medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partially offset by
higher commercial auto and other liability claims. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to reductions for workers’
compensation, medical professional liability and private passenger automobile claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’
loss events related to property and casualty reinsurance increased $162 million in 2020 and were reduced $295 million in 2019 and
$469 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 included increased claims estimates for legacy casualty exposures.
Estimated claim liabilities included amounts for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures, net of reinsurance
recoverable, of approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. These liabilities are
subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a
range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims.
Disaggregated information concerning our claims liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. The effects of
businesses acquired or disposed during the period are reflected in the data presented on a retrospective basis. A reconciliation of the
disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) of GEICO, Berkshire

GEICO
GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage
claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and
techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in
loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates.
We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to
establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large
volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability
claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated.
Estimates for liability coverages are more uncertain than for physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-
tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The
“claim-tail” is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date. Consequently, we establish additional case
development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated
by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting
reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of
unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when
actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.

GEICO’s incurred and paid losses and ALAE, net of reinsurance, are summarized by accident year below for physical
damage and auto liability claims. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. Claim counts are established
when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims
under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the
combined number of reported claims for all policy coverages and excludes projected IBNR claims. Dollars are in millions.

BH Primary
BH Primary’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily derive from medical professional liability
and workers’ compensation and other casualty insurance, including commercial auto and general liability insurance. Incurred and
paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability
coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31,
2020. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately
resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions.
BH Primary Medical Professional Liability
We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities
using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and
Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected
loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In
addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent development based upon
claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

BH Primary Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty
We periodically evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for the workers’ compensation and other
casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-
ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the
different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also
separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims
investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the
claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis
liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

BHRG
We use a variety of methodologies to establish BHRG’s estimates for property and casualty claims liabilities. We use certain
methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques
and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.
Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR
liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of
the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may
establish case liabilities based on our estimates.
K-96
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(15)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are
evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for
major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss
event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable.
Incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails
(property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple
lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report
loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on
internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year, net of reinsurance.
IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. Dollars are in millions.

Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance
contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence
immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of
the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and
related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).

In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the
contracts. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or
meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported
claims and case development liabilities have little or no practical analytical value.
Estimated ultimate claim liabilities included $17.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $18.2 billion at December 31, 2019,
with respect to an agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”) to indemnify
AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in excess of $25 billion retained by AIG for
certain commercial insurance loss events occurring prior to 2016. The related deferred charge assets were $5.4 billion at December
31, 2020 and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2019.

$1,188 million in 2019 and $919 million in 2018, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of
changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments.
In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project
losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts,
with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information
concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when
significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes.
Our retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury
exposures of approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $12.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Retroactive reinsurance
contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise
limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government
regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors
could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate
the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.
(17)Notes payable and other borrowings
Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity

In March 2020, Berkshire repaid €1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in
2025. In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥195.5 billion (approximately $1.8 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from
2023 to 2060 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.07%.
Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund
manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. During 2020, BHFC repaid $900 million of maturing senior notes and issued $3.0
billion of senior notes consisting of $500 million of 1.85% notes due in 2030, $750 million of 1.45% notes due in 2030 and $1.75
billion of 2.85% notes due in 2050.
The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.85 billion, £1.75 billion and
¥625.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes
in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax losses of approximately $1.0 billion in 2020 and pre-tax gains of $192 million in 2019 and
$366 million in 2018.

In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $1.2 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at
December 31, 2020. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable
guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of
certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing
arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios
and/or debt service coverage ratios. In November 2020, BHE’s subsidiary debt increased $5.6 billion for the debt assumed in
connection with the Dominion pipeline business acquisition. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2020,
BHE and its subsidiaries also issued new term debt of approximately $7.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062
and a weighted average interest rate of 3.2% and repaid $3.2 billion of term debt and reduced short-term borrowings.
BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior
unsecured debentures due in 2051 and repaid debt of $570 million. As of December 31, 2020, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries
were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of
BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating
approximately $9.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit
included approximately $8.2 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

We have not established deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which
are expected to be reinvested indefinitely. Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable
to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes
will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign
jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes.
On December 22, 2017, legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted. Among its
provisions, the TCJA reduced the statutory U.S. Corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and
provided for a one-time tax on certain accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. These effects were
largely recorded in 2017 upon the enactment. In 2018, we reduced our estimate of the income taxes on the deemed repatriation of
earnings of foreign subsidiaries and recognized additional deferred income tax rate change effects.

We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax
liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011 and the tax years 2012 and 2013 remain open.
The IRS is auditing Berkshire’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2014 through 2016 tax years. We are also
under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that
certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2021. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues
or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, net unrecognized tax benefits were $1,113 million and $952 million, respectively. Included
in the balance at December 31, 2020, were $920 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The
remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly
certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, these
positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate. We recorded income tax expense of $60 million
in 2020 and $377 million in 2019 for uncertain tax positions related to investments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment
funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax
benefits are not valid. We do not expect any material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2021.
(19)Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries
Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior
regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $23 billion as ordinary dividends during
2021. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance
authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $6.3 billion at
December 31, 2019.
Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules
(Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $237 billion at December 31, 2020 and $216 billion at December 31, 2019.
Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP, due to differences in accounting for certain assets and
liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain
investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the
carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully
recognized for statutory reporting purposes.

(20)Fair value measurements (Continued)
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The
hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.
Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.
Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged
in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as
interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that
are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations
generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar
characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same
industry sector.
Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is
required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets
or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to
make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets
or liabilities.
Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).

We acquired investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Occidental Preferred”) and Occidental

Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in the Occidental Preferred and Occidental
common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that
currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the
Occidental Preferred, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment. The Occidental Preferred is
redeemable at Occidental’s option beginning in 2029. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the
Occidental Preferred has a lower priority in liquidation than debt instruments. In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants,
we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the
expected duration and volatility of the warrants. The Occidental common stock warrants contractually expire on the one-year
anniversary on which no Occidental Preferred remains outstanding.
Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For
example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put
option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution
rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses
voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under
Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common
stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not
convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,543,960 shares outstanding as
of December 31, 2020 and 1,624,958 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are
economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding
represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding.
Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A
shares outstanding.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren
Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe
that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share
repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to
be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash
equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase
any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.
(23)Revenues from contracts with customers
We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the
customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with
our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.

(24)Pension plans
Certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Benefits under the plans are generally based on years of
service and compensation or fixed benefit rates. Plan sponsors may make contributions to the plans to meet regulatory requirements
and may also make discretionary contributions. The components of our net periodic pension expense for each of the three years
ending December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).

The projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and
compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Benefit
obligations under qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in trusts. Pension obligations under
certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded and the aggregate PBOs of such plans were approximately $1.6
billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cost of pension plans covering employees of certain
regulated subsidiaries of BHE are generally recoverable through the regulated rate making process.
The funded status at year end 2020 and 2019 and reconciliations of the changes in PBOs and plan assets related to BHE’s
pension plans and all other pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).

See Note 20 for a discussion of the three levels of fair value measurements. Plan assets are generally invested with the long-
term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk.
Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan
assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given
significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience
will differ from the assumed rates of return.

Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans.
Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for employer
matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by
management. Our defined contribution plan expense was approximately $1.4 billion in 2020, $1.2 billion in 2019 and $1.0 billion
in 2018.
(25)Contingencies and Commitments
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions
seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by
Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine
litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are
also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We
believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.
Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their
businesses. As of December 31, 2020, estimated future payments under such arrangements were as follows: $14.6 billion in 2021,
$4.5 billion in 2022, $3.4 billion in 2023, $2.8 billion in 2024, $3.1 billion in 2025 and $20.0 billion after 2025. The most
significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business.
Pursuant to the terms of agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be
obligated to acquire their equity interests. If we had acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2020, we
estimate the cost would have been approximately $6.3 billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments
that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners.

(27)Business segment data
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We
organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain
businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and
distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management.
The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated
Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those
transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and
derivative gains/losses, impairments or amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s
business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units.
Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts.
Berkshire’s operating segments are as follows.
 
Business Identity   Business Activity  
Insurance:   
GEICO  Underwriting private passenger automobile insurance mainly by direct
response methods
  
 
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  Underwriting multiple lines of property and casualty insurance policies for
