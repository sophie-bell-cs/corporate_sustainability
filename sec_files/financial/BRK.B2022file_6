Part I
Item 1. Business Description
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in
numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a
reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses.
Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing, services, retailing and other
activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated
business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant
capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses.
Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance
practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution
of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriate successor to the
Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to
ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees.
Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Berkshire and its
consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 372,000 people worldwide at the end of 2021, of which approximately 77%
were in the United States and 21% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations. Consistent
with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses individually establish specific policies
and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Given the wide variations in the nature
and size of business activities, policies and practices often vary widely among Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries. Policies and
practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating workplace
injuries; offering competitive compensation to employees, which includes various health insurance and retirement benefits, as well
as other benefits such as incentives to recognize and reward performance; wellness programs; training, learning and career
advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the
workforce.
Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses
Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based
insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks and
reinsurance of life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries employed approximately 50,500 people at the end
of 2021. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers.
In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly
subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may
arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or
reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.
Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance
coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultative
reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or
excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and
losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct
insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess
reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.
Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory
considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or
foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers compete on the
basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price,
performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.
K-1
 
Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which
they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially
solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and
establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s
authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their
shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts
are subject to prior regulatory approval.
Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to
as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium
rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers.
Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers
who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers.
Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally
not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts.
The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The
NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annual statutory
financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities
relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and
programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with
financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements.
U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles
(“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The IAIS
is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups (the “Insurance Capital Standard”) based on a
consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially comparable group capital standard based on the aggregation of
regulated entities and their underlying local capital requirements (the “Aggregation Method”). The IAIS standards address a variety
of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While
the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing various group supervision regulatory tools
and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S. state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to
promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic and international insurance regulators. The Nebraska
Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for our group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory
college. U.S. state regulators now require insurance groups to file an annual report, the Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA,
with the group’s lead supervisor. The NAIC recently adopted a group capital calculation based on methodology similar to the
Aggregation Method, which leverages the NAIC’s existing Risk Based Capital standards. The NAIC’s group capital calculation is a
tool designed to help the lead supervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing
further tools, including various liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in the near future.
Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their
competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $301 billion at
December 31, 2021. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M.
Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program
(“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The
Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the
Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events
occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in any calendar year.
To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing
policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal
share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA
participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft,
surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal
reinsurance of terrorism losses.
K-2
 
In the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction
of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’s deductible. Under the
Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the
immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2022 for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to approximate
$1.6 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each
TRIA year.
The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct
business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the
requirements differ substantially. For example:
 • in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in
others, only annual reports;
 • some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other
regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;
 • the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;
 • policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;
 • the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country;
 • the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary
significantly by country; and
 • regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.
Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee
insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.
Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of
subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”),
Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in several other countries. Most of these foreign jurisdictions
impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and
records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to
multinational application of certain U.S. laws.
There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the
potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic
developments.
In 2016, the U.K. voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the European Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”), which resulted in
the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European
Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to
operate in the EU, and Berkshire continues to maintain a substantial presence in London following Brexit.
Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary
Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products
that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over long time periods
(creating “float,” see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately
priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and
underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional
information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows.
GEICO—GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government
Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company,
GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County
Mutual Insurance Company, GEICO Texas County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The
GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial
fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals
who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO.
K-3
 
GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly
to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through
regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states.
The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private
passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell
directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA.
GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of
approximately 26.0% over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2020, the five largest
automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2020 of approximately 59.7% based on written premiums, with GEICO’s
market share being the second largest at approximately 13.5%. GEICO’s written premiums in 2020 were reduced by the effects of
the GEICO Giveback Program implemented in response to significant reductions in claim frequencies attributable to reduced
policyholder driving during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-related premium credit programs of other
private passenger insurers may not have been reported as premium reductions, which impacts the industry data reported by A.M
Best. Since the publication of that data, GEICO’s management estimates its current market share is approximately 14.2%. Seasonal
variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have
a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.
State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance
companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to
focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on
customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to
manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects those and other service
marks through appropriate registrations.
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group—The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of
independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the
United States. These various operations are discussed below.
National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in Nebraska, and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite
commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance
coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers.
The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation,
commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to
provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where
coverage is available only through state-operated workers’ compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in
Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) offers commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional
liability, executive and professional, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowner’s insurance through Berkshire Hathaway
Specialty Insurance Company and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. BH Specialty writes primary and excess policies on an
admitted and surplus basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in
Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several U.S. cities. BH Specialty also maintains international offices
located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. BH Specialty writes business
through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents.
MedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance in the United States. MedPro
provides customized HCL insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare
professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance
solutions to international markets through other Berkshire insurance affiliates, delivers liability insurance to other professionals,
and offers specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other
Berkshire insurance affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”) includes a group of five specialty insurers that underwrite commercial,
professional and personal lines insurance on an admitted basis, as well as on an excess and surplus basis. USLI markets policies in
all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite
and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania.
K-4
 
Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide a full
suite of commercial insurance products, as well as homeowners policies to over 350,000 small to mid-sized businesses and
homeowners. These offerings are made through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-
Barre, Pennsylvania.
MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”) has been the leading writer of medical professional liability insurance in New
York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes the majority of its policies on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals,
health care providers and hospitals.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group—Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire
Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers
and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 24 countries. Reinsurance business is written through NICO and
certain other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries (collectively, the “NICO Group”) and General Re Corporation, domiciled in
Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in
Stamford, Connecticut.
The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and
coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived
level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance
transactions.
Property/casualty
The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis,
catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual
risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from
changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual
reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited
(“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries.
The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on
both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser
degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance
Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited
reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 12 branch
offices in the U.S. and Canada.
In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity
Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and
professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general
underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive
customers.
General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG, based
in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries. International business is
also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the
managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate
435.
Life/health
The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the
General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business
is marketed on a direct basis. Life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group in 2021 were primarily in the Asia Pacific,
United States and Western Europe.
Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write
reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures.
BHLN and affiliates are parties to contracts that reinsure certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar benefit risks on
closed-blocks of variable annuity risks under reinsurance contracts, with the most recent contract incepting in 2014.
K-5
 
Retroactive reinsurance
NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding
companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and
casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or
for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to
aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental
and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts.
The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms
since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to
exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts
of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future
periods.
Periodic payment annuity
BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these
policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These
policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of other insurers, known as
structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in
establishing annuity premiums, and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted
liabilities.
Investments of insurance businesses—Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets.
Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very large portfolio of
publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and
short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and
insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity
securities than is customary in the insurance industry.
Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and
reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities
that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and
health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred
policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has
grown from approximately $91 billion at the end of 2016 to approximately $147 billion at the end of 2021. The cost of float can be
measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In each of the three years ending December 31,
2021, Berkshire’s consolidated cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains.
Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF
Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000 employees at
the end of 2021. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business.
In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States,
BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries.
Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company
quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the
international, national and regional levels.
BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern
United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many
smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing

Regulatory Matters
BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are
subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the
United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as
other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction
over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line
extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB
proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.
The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent
of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas
not otherwise preempted by federal law.
Environmental Matters
BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities
associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting
chemicals and other hazardous materials.
Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to
commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular,
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and
severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the
original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental
costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF
operations.
Consumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions
in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science-based approaches,
that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF’s GHG-emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018. BNSF intends to continue
improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and
hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested.
Competition
The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated
motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The
presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage
continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could
further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads
seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.
As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF
Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I
railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.

K-8
 
Regulatory Matters
PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local
agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement
provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for
wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission
systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction
and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of
up to $1.4 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to
regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25%
ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.
With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their
service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of
customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail
customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail
electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state
regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a
reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the
Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and
distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-only services.
Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution
systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets
Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023.
AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the
Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The
AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad
authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under
the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta
Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of
those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system
(“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the
AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.
The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage
operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the
Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and
conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the
extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas
import/export facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of
Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety
regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements
in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.
Environmental Matters
BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change,
renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal,
hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and
future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean
Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and
other sanctions.
The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for
protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be
promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at
those facilities to comply with the requirements.
K-9
 
Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers
to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington,
California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal
clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact
electricity generators and natural gas providers.
In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for
coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of
limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius;
establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at
achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and
progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new
commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris
Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris
Agreement formally entered into force on November 4, 2016. The United States completed its withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 21, 2021, and the
United States completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April
2021, with the United States pledging to cut its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to
reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.
On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan,
which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units
of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule,
which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of
emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies
and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source
itself. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Affordable Clean Energy Rule in its entirety. In October
2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. Arguments in the case will be held in February 2022 and a
decision regarding the scope of the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is expected by
June 2022. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments
and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.
BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers
and on actions to mitigate its greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of
electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation, BHE works with its
regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability and sources of electric
generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned wind, solar and geothermal generation, with cumulative
investments of $30.1 billion through 2021 and has retired 16 coal generation units. As a result, BHE has reduced its annual GHG
emissions by about 20% from 2005 levels. BHE plans to continue investing in wind, solar and other low-carbon generation in the
future and to retire an additional 16 coal generation units between 2022 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby
achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.

Industrial products
Precision Castparts
Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality investment
castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also
manufactures seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine (“IGT”) and nuclear power plants; downhole casing and tubing,
fittings and various mill forms in a variety of nickel and steel alloys for severe-service oil and gas environments; investment
castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard
mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding
consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control and other industries;
revert management solutions; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment casting
and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and forging industries; grinder
pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the
power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener market and other applications.
Investment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal
components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using other methods.
PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, IGT and other aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical
implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon
and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines.
PCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets, including seamless
pipe for coal-fired, IGT and nuclear power plants, and downhole casings and tubing pipe for severe service oil and gas markets.
PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non-aerospace
applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. These titanium products are used to
manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy and other industrial end markets.
PCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and
precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and power and
energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and construction equipment,
shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliance and recreation markets.
PCC has several significant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and
aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney). The majority of PCC’s sales are from
customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the
customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although
periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, delay
requests increased, with delivery dates extending in some cases beyond 2021.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020 and
2021. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking at extraordinary
rates. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX also adversely impacted 2020 and 2021 and quality issues with the Boeing 787
negatively impacted 2021. Aircraft build rates have not recovered in any meaningful way. During 2020, PCC significantly reduced
its worldwide workforce by about 40% to help align operations to reduced aircraft build rates. The restructuring actions taken
began to improve margins in late 2020 and further margin improvements were achieved in 2021.
K-11
 
PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by
competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its
manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices
and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of
the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several
factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid
PCC in maintaining competitive advantages.
Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and
molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products.
The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor
relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.
PCC is currently subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things, water
discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Laws and regulations
continue to evolve, and it is reasonably possible that environmental standards will become more stringent in the future, particularly
under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change, including reporting of greenhouse gas emissions.
As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additional expenditures, including capital
expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters.
Lubrizol

to develop or acquire innovative products for the markets it serves. Lubrizol uses many specialty and commodity chemical raw
materials in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials are primarily feedstocks derived from petroleum and petrochemicals and,
generally, are obtainable from several sources. The materials that Lubrizol chooses to purchase from a single source typically are
subject to long-term supply contracts to ensure supply reliability.
Lubrizol operates its business on a global basis through more than 100 offices, laboratories, production facilities and
warehouses on six continents, the most significant of which are North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Lubrizol markets
its products worldwide through direct sales, sales agents and distributors. Lubrizol’s customers principally consist of major global
and regional oil companies and industrial and consumer products companies. Some of Lubrizol’s largest customers also may be
suppliers. During 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Lubrizol’s consolidated revenues. In 2021, the
COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an adverse effect on many of the markets that Lubrizol serves, as did worldwide supply
chain disruptions, affecting both the availability of raw materials and fulfillment of customer orders. In addition, the occurrence and
duration of the February 2021 winter storms and freezing temperatures in Texas significantly interrupted operations at Lubrizol’s
manufacturing facilities.
Lubrizol expends significant capital to ensure the safety of its employees and the communities where it operates, as well as
delivering on its commitments to operational excellence and cybersecurity. Lubrizol also makes significant capital investments to
ensure reliable supply and compliance with regulations governing its operations, while reducing their environmental footprint.
K-12
 
Lubrizol is subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws to protect the environment, limit manufacturing waste and
emissions, ensure product and employee safety and regulate trade. While the company believes that its policies, practices and
procedures are designed to limit the risks of non-compliance with laws and consequent financial liability, it experienced a fire at
one of its chemical manufacturing facilities in 2019, which resulted in significant cleanup and remediation costs. Lubrizol also
suffered a fire in 2021 that resulted in a total loss of its grease manufacturing facility. The operation of chemical manufacturing
plants entails ongoing environmental and other risks, and significant capital expenditures, costs or liabilities could be incurred in
the future.

Building Products
Clayton
Clayton Homes, Inc. (“Clayton”), headquartered near Knoxville, Tennessee, is a vertically integrated housing company
offering traditional site-built homes and off-site built housing, including modular, manufactured, CrossMod™ and tiny homes. In
2021, Clayton delivered approximately 50,000 off-site built and 11,000 site-built homes. Clayton also offers home financing and
insurance products and competes on price, service, location and delivery capabilities.
All Clayton Built® off-site homes are designed, engineered and assembled in the United States. As of December 2021, off-
site backlog was $1.4 billion, up 10% from the prior year. Clayton sells its homes through independent and company-owned home
centers, realtors and subdivision channels. Clayton considers its ability to make financing available to retail purchasers a factor
affecting the market acceptance of its off-site built homes. Clayton’s financing programs utilize proprietary loan underwriting
guidelines to evaluate loan applicants, which include ability to repay calculations, including debt to income limits, and incorporate
residual income and credit score requirements.
Since 2015, Clayton’s site-built division, Clayton Properties Group, has expanded through the acquisition of nine builders
across 14 states with over 300 subdivisions, supplementing the portfolio of housing products offered to customers. Clayton’s site-
builders currently own and control approximately 83,000 homesites, with a home order backlog of approximately $2.5 billion.
Historically, access to key inputs such as lumber, steel and resin products has been adequate. During 2021, the availability
and pricing of these and other inputs has been volatile. Input shortages coupled with labor and subcontractor availability have
increased the time to construct a home, constraining our ability to meet current demand.
Clayton’s home building business regularly makes capital and non-capital expenditures with respect to compliance with
federal, state and local environmental regulations, primarily related to erosion control, permitting and stormwater protection for
site-built home subdivisions. The financing business originates and services loans which are federally regulated by the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, various state regulatory agencies and reviewed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the Government National Mortgage Association and government-sponsored enterprises.

over 2,100 salaried and commissioned sales personnel directly to retailers and distributors and to large national accounts. Shaw’s
seven carpet, nine hard surface, one sample full-service distribution facility, three sample satellite locations and 30 redistribution
centers, along with centralized management information systems, enable it to provide prompt and efficient delivery of its products
to both its retail customers and wholesale distributors.
Substantially all carpet manufactured by Shaw is tufted carpet made from nylon, polypropylene and polyester. In the tufting
process, yarn is inserted by multiple needles into a synthetic backing, forming loops, which may be cut or left uncut, depending on
the desired texture or construction. During 2021, Shaw processed approximately 97% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own
yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials is adequate, but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and natural gas
price changes. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers.
The soft floor covering industry is highly competitive with only a handful of key players domestically where the majority of
Shaw’s business occurs. There are numerous manufacturers, domestically and internationally, that are engaged in hard surface floor
covering production, distribution and sales. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 44% of the total
United States consumption of all flooring types. The principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality,
style, price and service.

products also contain materials other than fiberglass, including various chemical and petrochemical-based materials used in roofing
and other specialized products. JM uses recycled material when available and suitable to satisfy the broader needs of its customers.
The raw materials used in these various products are generally readily available in sufficient quantities from various sources to
maintain and expand its current production levels.

In addition, Benjamin Moore operates an online “pick up in store” program, which allows consumers to place orders via an
e-commerce site or, for national accounts and government agencies, via its customer information center. These orders may be
picked up at the customer’s nearest retailer or delivered. For national accounts, drop-ship orders can be fulfilled by Benjamin
Moore if a minimum gallon threshold is met.
Benjamin Moore competes with numerous manufacturers, distributors and paint, coatings and related products retailers.
Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive
advantage. Competitors include other paint and decorating stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores,
hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets, such as Sherwin-Williams Company, PPG Industries, Inc., The Valspar
Corporation, The Home Depot, Inc. and Lowe’s Companies, Inc.
The most significant raw materials in Benjamin Moore products are titanium dioxide, monomers, polymers and pigments.
Historically, these materials have been generally available, with pricing and availability subject to fluctuation. In 2021, raw
material supply constraints and increased customer demand for products prevailed and disrupted Benjamin Moore’s ability to build
inventory. A major winter storm that impacted the Gulf Coast region of the United States in February of 2021 caused substantial
supply chain disruptions for Benjamin Moore, which contributed to significant inflation in manufacturing costs.
Benjamin Moore undertakes to comply with applicable regulations relating to protection of the environment and workers’
safety and products meet or exceed environmental standards. Benjamin Moore has certain known past environmental matters,
which are subject to on-going monitoring and/or remediation efforts.

U.S.-grown cotton fiber and U.S.-manufactured polyester fiber are the main raw materials used in manufacturing FOL’s
products. Historically, fibers have been purchased from a limited number of third parties. In 2015, FOL entered into an agreement
with one key supplier to provide the majority of its yarn spinning/raw material conversion services. As a result, yarn production
was primarily with one supplier. Supply chain issues related to the COVID pandemic including labor shortage at suppliers, yarn
shortages, and price inflation in raw materials and freight resulted in FOL utilizing alternative sources of raw materials and yarn in
2021. Further, FOL has contracted with an additional supplier for a significant portion of FOL’s yarn spinning/raw material
conversion services that is scheduled to begin in July 2022. If relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in
obtaining alternative sources of supply, production and operating results can be adversely affected. FOL’s markets are highly
competitive, consisting of many domestic and foreign manufacturers and distributors. Competition is generally based upon product
features, quality, customer service and price.

equipment. Therefore, as a provider of marginal capacity to its customers, XTRA’s utilization rates and operating results tend to be
cyclical. In addition, transportation providers often use leasing to maximize their asset utilization and reduce capital expenditures.
By maintaining a large fleet, XTRA is able to provide customers with a broad selection of equipment and quick response times.
International Dairy Queen Inc. develops and services a worldwide system of over 7,000 franchised restaurants operating
primarily under the names DQ Grill and Chill®, Dairy Queen® and Orange Julius® that offer various dairy desserts, beverages,
prepared foods and blended fruit drinks. Business Wire Inc. (“Business Wire”) transmits full-text news releases, regulatory filings,
photos and other multimedia content to journalists, financial professionals, investor services, regulatory authorities and the general
public. Releases are distributed globally via Business Wire’s patented NX network. CORT Business Services Corporation
(“CORT”) is a leading national provider of rental furniture and related services in the “rent-to-rent” segment of the furniture rental
industry. CORT’s primary revenue streams include furniture rental to individuals, businesses, government agencies, the trade show
and events industry and retail sales of new and used furniture. WPLG, Inc. is an ABC affiliate broadcast station in Miami, Florida
and Charter Brokerage Holdings Corp. is a leading non-asset based third party logistics provider to the petroleum and chemical

Retailing Businesses
Berkshire’s retailing businesses include automotive, home furnishings and several other operations that sell various
consumer products. Berkshire’s retailing businesses employed approximately 26,000 people at the end of 2021. Information
regarding each of these operations follows.
Berkshire Hathaway Automotive
Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”) and its affiliates is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United
States, currently operating 105 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in
the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts,
vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party
lenders. BHA operates 28 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto
auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company.
Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of dealership-
related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle
manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln,
Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these
manufacturers.
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership
groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via
the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume,
the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting
customers.
BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework
agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships.
Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing
those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer
that may be owned by BHA.
K-21
 
Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-
exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as
well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the
management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-
renewal for a variety of causes. States generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the
franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with
“good cause” under the applicable state franchise law.
BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health
insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training
programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only
risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair
our business operations.
General Business Risks
Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses.
A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business
operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities
and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses.
Cyber security risks
We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our
information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-
service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more
sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety
failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users
and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and
expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.
Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery
planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant operations could
adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop,
implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or
compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage
to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost
revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security,
repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could
materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism,
sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these
risks with all businesses.
We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.
Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board
of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 91, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
age 98. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance
operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to
Mr. Buffett. Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions.
If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a
material adverse effect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Buffett be needed currently, Berkshire’s Board of Directors
has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Buffett. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view
regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding
managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk.
K-24
 
We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses.
In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of
our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory
environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving
their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and
personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a
whole.
Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value.
We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small
number of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a
material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings.
Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair
values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our large statutory
surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability
ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits.
Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.
Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our
businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages,
many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our
future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive
advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline.
Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access
capital markets at a reasonable cost.
Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in
which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse
effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business
regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital
markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these
operations could be adversely affected.
Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses.
The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may
adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested
or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and
services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity
securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues,
regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of
banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all
of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our
operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot
predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
and/or cash flows.
Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These
regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems,
networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties.
K-25
 
Risks unique to our regulated businesses
Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.
When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single
event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event
resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined
underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid
writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. However,
despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies
are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage,
negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may
result in lower reported earnings in a future period.
The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may
result in significant underwriting losses.
The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty
insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades
before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that
liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages
provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our
estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($125 billion at
December 31, 2021), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings.
Climate change may impact our businesses.
Climate change could cause increases in hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other risks that could produce losses affecting our
businesses. Also, failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretations of existing regulations relating to climate
change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.
Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital.
Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to
among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that
must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing
and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance
regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active
insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes
in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may
adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.
Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to
rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to
comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change
the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects
that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and
implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures.
BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To
the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or
alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a
common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of
hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations.
Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to
make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or
liquidity.
K-26
 
Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign
governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to
new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly
apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including:
acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating
facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental
requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; managing and reporting
transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions.
Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air
and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct
disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the
regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.
Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that
transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also
require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet
their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in
order to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capital projects may not be recoverable through rates
that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by
BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could
adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business,
including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts
issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal
and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its
subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and
penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press
releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-
looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking
statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which
include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any
statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business
strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking
statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events
and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the
industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no
specific intention to update these statements.
Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a
number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ
materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in
fixed maturity and equity securities; losses realized from derivative contracts; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events,
such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or
losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19,
that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates;
changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal
income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which
we do business.

* Includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in 2020
and $435 million in 2019, which includes our share of charges recorded by Kraft Heinz.
Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an
unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team
participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the
Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to date
ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined
considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021,
many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instances exceeding pre-pandemic
levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chain disruptions, including those
attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed to higher input costs. We cannot reliably
predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can
we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve.
Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020 and
$325 million in 2019. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from
reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.3
billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by
reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were
negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims
frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the
effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for
private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty
reinsurance business.
After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to 2020 and declined 8.9% in 2020
versus 2019. Earnings in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash
and U.S. Treasury Bills.
K-32
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Results of Operations (Continued)
After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose 16.1% compared to 2020 and decreased 5.8% in 2020 compared to
2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved
productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad
operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by
lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business in 2021
increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 included higher earnings from
the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage
business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from
the real estate brokerage business.
Earnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 34.0% versus 2020 and declined 11.4%
in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020. While customer
demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced higher materials, freight and other
input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have varied among
our businesses relative to significance and duration.
Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021,
$11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz.
Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2021 also included
after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $955 million and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to non-U.S. Dollar
denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).
Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in
equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe that investment and
derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are
generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our
operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.
Insurance—Underwriting
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.
Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s
Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of
underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment
income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses,
whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the
periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.
The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,
particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a
current year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in
Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter.
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior
years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive
reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also
include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar
denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
K-33
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in 2021 and
2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions for claims and
uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic on future
periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and
by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time.
We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks.
Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance
Group.
Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

GEICO
GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the
company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
 
 2021   2020   2019  
 Amount  %   Amount  %   Amount  %  
Premiums written $38,395      $34,928      $36,016

Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 1,259      $ 3,428      $ 1,506    
 
 
GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2021 and 2020 were significantly affected by changes in average claims
frequencies. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies
were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These
effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program,
which provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle new policies or policies renewing between April 8,
2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by
policyholders increased. In addition, average property claims severities increased due to increases in used vehicle valuations.
K-34
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
2021 versus 2020
Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately
$2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion (7.4%) compared to
2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 with the remainder of the
impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to 2020.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss
adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the
loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events,
partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years.
Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen
percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range).
Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage
(fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims
occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020, which produced corresponding
reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses. Losses incurred attributable to Hurricane Ida in 2021 were $375 million, while
losses in 2020 included $81 million attributable to Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires.
Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses. GEICO’s
expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflecting lower nominal
expenses and higher premiums earned.
2020 versus 2019
Premiums written and earned in 2020 decreased $1.1 billion (3.0%) and $479 million (1.3%), respectively, compared to
2019. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written $2.9 billion and premiums earned $2.5 billion in 2020. Voluntary
auto policies-in-force increased approximately 820,000 during 2020.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s loss ratio was
74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims
frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO
Giveback program.
Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-
eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims
severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage
(twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for
decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses
incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant
catastrophe events in 2019.
Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related,
advertising and technology costs, partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 was 16.1%, an increase of
1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline in earned premiums
from the GEICO Giveback program.

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group
The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including
healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialty coverages for small,
medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”),
Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies
(“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”). A summary of BH
Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
 
 2021   2020   2019  
 Amount  %   Amount  %   Amount  %  
Premiums written $12,595      $10,212      $ 9,843     
Premiums earned $11,575   100.0  $ 9,615   100.0  $ 9,165   100.0 
Losses and loss adjustment expenses  8,107   70.0   7,129   74.1   6,336   69.1

Total losses and expenses  10,968   94.8   9,505   98.8   8,782   95.8 
Pre-tax underwriting earnings $ 607      $ 110      $ 383    
 
 
Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increases from BH Specialty (36%),
MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%), BHHC (5%) and USLI (20%). The increases were across multiple
coverages and occurred in several markets.
Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH
Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers.
The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation and commercial
automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019.
BH Primary’s loss ratios were 70.0% in 2021, 74.1% in 2020 and 69.1% in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses
attributable to significant catastrophe events were $402 million in 2021 from Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri and $207 million
in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $631 million in
2021, $265 million in 2020 and $499 million in 2019 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events.
Losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities of $167 million attributable to the pandemic.
BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance
and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant
increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or
judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated.
Underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in business,
changes in business mix and the costs associated with new product development. The expense ratio in 2021 was relatively
unchanged versus 2020. The expense ratio in 2020 declined 2.0 percentage points compared to 2019 and reflected changes in
business mix and the impact of the Applied Underwriters divestiture.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on
property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company
(“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages
through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska
(“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In
addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in
establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the
claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge
amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for
investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Premiums written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business,
increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase was primarily
attributable to property coverages. Premiums written increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was
primarily attributable to net new business and increased participations on renewals.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020, while the loss ratio decreased 9.1
percentage points. The loss ratio was 71.9% in 2021, 81.0% in 2020 and 73.8% in 2019. Losses incurred arising from significant
catastrophe events in 2021 (Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe and Winter Storm Uri) were $2.1 billion, which were partially offset
by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $718 million. Losses incurred in 2020 included
$667 million from significant catastrophe events (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires), losses attributable to the COVID-
19 pandemic of $964 million and increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $162 million.
Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events during 2019 were $1.0 billion and derived from Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis
and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses
occurring in prior years of $295 million.
Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3 percentage
points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects. Underwriting expenses
increased $533 million (20.6%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the increase in premiums earned.

Life/health premiums written decreased $227 million (3.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Premiums written in 2020 included
$710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019 and did not renew in 2021.
Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and
favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in
mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America, attributable to the pandemic.
Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the
increase was attributable to the contract covering U.S. health insurance risks, and the remainder of the increase was primarily from
volume growth in Asia and Europe. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from
COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating disability benefit
liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business
that is in run-off. Results in 2019 included a one-time pre-tax underwriting gain of $163 million attributable to an amendment of a
yearly renewable term life contract.
Retroactive reinsurance
Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated
timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries.
Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency gains of $56 million in 2021 and losses of $139 million in 2020 and $76
million in 2019.
Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $838 million in 2021, $1.1 billion in 2020 and $1.2
billion in 2019. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for contracts written in prior years were reduced $974 million in 2021 and $399
million in 2020. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of
the future claim payments, such reductions produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $142 million in 2021 and $230 million in
2020.
Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $38.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of
$2.7 billion since December 31, 2020. The decline was primarily attributable to paid claims of approximately $1.9 billion and the
reduction in estimated ultimate claim liabilities. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were
$10.6 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $1.8 billion since December 31, 2020, attributable to the effects of the changes in
the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments and periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be
included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.

Periodic payment annuity
Periodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $92 million (16.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which decreased $297
million (34.4%) versus 2019. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Our premium volumes in 2021
and 2020 were affected by pandemic-related delays in underlying claim settlements, which reduced the supply of available
business. Our volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the
perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition.
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount
accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest
rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax
underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $18 million in 2021 and losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in
2019.
Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $526
million in 2021, $550 million in 2020 and $509 million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher
mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.1
billion at December 31, 2021 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%.
Variable annuity
Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $114 million in 2021, losses of $18 million in
2020 and earnings of $167 million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins.
The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and,
to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets.

Interest and other investment income declined $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn, declined $1.0
billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed
maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-
term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. Low rates prevailed through 2021, which resulted in
significantly lower interest income. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety
over yield with respect to short-term investments.

Insurance—Investment Income (Continued)
Dividend income included $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire
Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Dividend income may vary from
period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees.
Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to dividends
from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation
(“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments.
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and
reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities
under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities
due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive
reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at December 31, 2021, $138 billion at
December 31, 2020 and $129 billion at December 31, 2019. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting
earnings in each of the past three years, and consequently, the average cost of float for each year was negative.

2021 versus 2020
Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as a
3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to
higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a
significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued
improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoing disruptions in the global supply
chain.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Railroad (Continued)
Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased
volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both
international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-
commerce activity.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased
5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement
in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum
volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector.
Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change
reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related
commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit.
Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of
8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity
generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand.
Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of
railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The
increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable
impact of productivity improvements.
Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased
volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977
million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $79 million
(4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding,
partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $79 million (4.7%) compared to
2020, due to higher volume-related costs.
2020 versus 2019
Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease
in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by
lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which
severely impacted volumes through the first half of 2020 and caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the
demand for transportation services. Volumes sequentially improved during the second half of 2020 from earlier periods and
recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.
Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the
pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable
outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding
table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance
compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively
affected expenses and service levels in 2019.
Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a
6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of
the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail
sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half
of 2020.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Railroad (Continued)
Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was
primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased
primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy
sector, which lowered sand and petroleum products volume, and reduced steel demand, which lowered taconite volume.
Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was
due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to
higher grain and meal exports, partially offset by lower ethanol and sweeteners shipments.
Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to
lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower
electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures.
Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating
expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses
in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved
weather conditions compared to 2019.
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower
employee counts associated with lower volume and improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion (39.2%)
compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services
expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity
and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expense
decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and
lower personal injury and derailment expenses.

2021 versus 2020
PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming.
After-tax earnings increased $148 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher utility margin (operating
revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higher production tax
credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increase was partially offset by lower
allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses in 2021
reflected increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effective January 1, 2021, and incremental costs
associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, offset by lower costs associated with wildfires and a
settlement agreement.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Utilities and Energy (Continued)
PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $145 million compared to 2020. The increase reflected
higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher
thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily
due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather.
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $65
million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly
offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with wind-powered
generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by lower storm restoration costs. The
income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating
facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking.
MEC electric utility margin increased $190 million to $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The electric utility margin
increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes, as well as favorable
wholesale prices, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes
increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers and the favorable
impacts of weather.
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $29 million in 2021
compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, lower net interest and finance expense and lower income tax
expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decreases in operating expenses were
mainly due to lower earnings sharing, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service.
NV Energy’s electric utility margin decreased $97 million to $1.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was
primarily due to revenue reductions from lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020,
partially offset by a 3.3% increase in electric retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was
primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impacts of weather.
Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $46 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher tariff
rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs, lower pension expense and favorable foreign currency
exchange rate movements in 2021, partially offset by the impact of increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate.
Earnings in 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the
income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Earnings in 2020 included deferred income tax expense of $35 million
related to the enactment in July 2020 of an increase in the income tax rate from 17% to 19%, effective April 1, 2020.
Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $246 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included BHE
GT&S for the full year compared to two months in 2020. The incremental earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were $211 million. In
addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern
Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue
primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year.
Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings in 2021 decreased $17 million compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly due
to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity
investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax
benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Earnings in 2021 from other energy projects
increased due to higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and a transmission investment, as well as
favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to a
comparative increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower funded mortgage volume due to a
decrease in refinance activity.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily
due to favorable comparative state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services, offset by higher
operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Utilities and Energy (Continued)
2020 versus 2019
PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating
expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects
placed in-service, higher utility margin and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs
associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits.
PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected
higher operating revenue from an increase in average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset
by lower operating revenue from a decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the
impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather.
MEC after-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax
benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of
ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net
interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins.
MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin
decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail
sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a
1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by
certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020
compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather.
NV Energy after-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility
margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The
increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and
higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service.
NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was
primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only
service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was
primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic.
Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected
write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate
income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense.
Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to
$73 million of earnings from BHE GT&S, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas and higher
transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses.
Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to
increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation,
partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher
earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher
refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an
increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily
due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits.

Industrial products
The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision
Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC
International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and
service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container
and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural
industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty
Products).
2021 versus 2020
Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $714
million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of 1.3
percentage points compared 2020.
PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC has
derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in
commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. While commercial air
travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets in 2021 versus 2020, demand remains well below pre-pandemic levels,
especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for travel, however,
the recovery has been uneven between domestic and international markets. Air traffic recovery will continue to be impacted by the
pandemic, though likely more on a seasonal or localized basis as the pandemic shifts to an endemic phase. Near term recovery in
build rates will lag recovery in air travel due to the significant finished goods inventory following quality issues with the Boeing
737 and Boeing 787 planes and industry supply chain issues.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020. The increase reflects the actions
taken by management to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for PCC’s
products, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. We do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospace revenues or
earnings to occur in the near term, primarily due to the relatively low aircraft build rates related to Boeing’s significant inventory
levels and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air travel.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average
selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales
volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021, which caused the
temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in the second half of 2021.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included significant losses related
to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois and impairment
charges in the second half of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. These losses
and charges aggregated $257 million in 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the effects of accelerating raw
material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives production facilities, which resulted in lost sales
and incremental manufacturing costs.
Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020. Revenues in 2021 from
the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the
aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of
significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the
construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes and favorable
foreign currency translation effects. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the
Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on
lease and changes in lease mix.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased 40.3% compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings increases
in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins. Earnings of
several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring
charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Industrial products (Continued)
IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in most geographic
regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily
attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and
favorable foreign currency translation effects.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined
$1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group was 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019.
PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic
contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying
delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft
manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production
issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant
declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. PCC’s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2% in 2020,
primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $650 million in 2020, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in
aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects
of the pandemic, PCC took aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in
aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% from the end of 2019. PCC recorded restructuring,
inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Earnings as a percentage of revenues were negatively
impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable
to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in
Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020
also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume for the year
declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by
higher volumes in Life Science products.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of
lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw
material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire.
Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of
business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all groups, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the
pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies groups. Additionally,
revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines
in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services groups. Marmon
acquired the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, which represents Marmon’s Medical group.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the declines in
revenues and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower product demand,
particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic.

IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on
demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings
declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to changes in sales
mix.
Building products
The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial
services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry
products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and
engineering products and systems (MiTek).
2021 versus 2020
Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532 million
(18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our
businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain
disruptions, which affected the general economy, and contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and
supply constraints.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020.
Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per
home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while
factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction
periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination
and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net
of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7
billion compared to December 31, 2020.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared
to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower
provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision
for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The comparative decline in the provision for expected credit losses was due to fewer actual and anticipated loan foreclosures.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of
14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply
chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products.
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over
2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While
customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain
disruptions negatively affected sales and operating results. In addition, higher costs for raw materials and freight and higher
restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings
increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019.

increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per
home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home
increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues increased 13.7% in 2020
compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of
allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31,
2019.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared
to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered
manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense
and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6%
versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, in part attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, partially offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware
Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets.
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over
2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower
facilities closure costs.
Consumer products
The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including
Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries
(Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline).
2021 versus 2020
Consumer products revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased
40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices,
primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs.
Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The
initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe
impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting
significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer
demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%.
Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of
revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many of our
businesses, driven by Forest River, the apparel and footwear businesses, Richline and Larson-Juhl. However, our consumer
products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increases and supply chain
disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the first half of the year.
2020 versus 2019
Consumer products revenues increased $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146
million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%.

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Consumer products (Continued)
The comparative increase in revenues reflected increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower apparel
and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a significant
increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second half of
2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting
the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020 compared to 2019.
Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects
of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain
manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and
inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019
that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility.
Pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion in 2020, an increase of $146 million (11.7%) compared to 2019. The increase was
primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The overall
increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense management efforts.

Service
Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation
services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services
to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a
network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third
party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news,
multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Service (Continued)
2021 versus 2020
Service group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to higher revenues
from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to
significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent, higher average prices and
changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in
response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services
increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%).
Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as
a percentage of revenues were 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service
businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA
leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to the increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved
operating cost leverage and changes in sales mix. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable
effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of
past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand.
2020 versus 2019
Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million
(4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020, an increase of 0.5 percentage points
compared to 2019.
The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting
lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in
customer flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The
comparative service group revenue decline also reflected the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020 and lower
revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the pandemic. These declines were partially offset by
revenue increases from TTI and WPLG.
The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and the divestiture of the newspaper
operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline reflected
lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory
availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, partly
offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was driven by lower
revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the effects of
contract losses of approximately $165 million recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control
efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services.
Retailing
Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 62% of our combined retailing
revenue in 2021. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and
related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products
distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey,
Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented
21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021.
Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies
(confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies
and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany.

Retailing (Continued)
2021 versus 2020
Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0% in
2021 compared to 2020, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus
2020. Revenues from vehicle sales in 2021 increased $1.7 billion (20.7%) versus 2020, primarily due to higher average selling
prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% compared
to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at OEMs attributable to the global computer chip
shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0% in 2021 as compared to 2020,
attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher inventory and freight costs.
Pre-tax earnings in 2021 of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate
increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to
increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in 2021
benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from ongoing operating
cost control efforts.
Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average gross
margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for
the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020
were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses. Results in 2021 also
benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020.
2020 versus 2019
Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 resulted in the
temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending patterns during
2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations.
BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-
owned vehicle sales of 2.6%, as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially
unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The retailing group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to
restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply
chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels.
The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candies and
Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales
volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations
slowly reopened.
Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%,
primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales
margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019,
reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower
earnings from our other retailing operations.
Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher
average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions and lower advertising and other operating expenses.
Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while
others, including See’s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects of
the pandemic.

McLane
McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer
products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that
are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high
sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands
and others. Grocery sales comprised about 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2021 with food service comprising most of the
remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and
earnings.
2021 versus 2020
Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5%
compared to 2020, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively. The
foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020.
Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant increases in
personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher
gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain
constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs reflected in a
LIFO inventory reserve increase of $130 million, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects,
together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we are experiencing, adversely affected our customer service
levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, our hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021.
The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult
operating environment to continue through 2022.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19-related
restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product
categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53
weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as
compared to 2019.
Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of
increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the
impact of lower sales.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued)
Investment gains/losses
Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our
reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity
securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized
gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021, $55.0 billion in 2020 and $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market
prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market
value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including gains of $1.0 billion in 2021, losses of $14.0
billion in 2020 and gains of $1.6 billion in 2019. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the
difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.6 billion in 2021, $6.2 billion in 2020
and $3.2 billion in 2019.
We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often
meaningless in terms of understanding our periodic consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We
continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in
any given period has little analytical or predictive value.
Derivative contract gains/losses
Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which
relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. A vast majority of these contracts have since expired. Contracts
comprising 63% of the remaining notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022. The periodic
changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and, historically, were significant, primarily due to the
volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was
near zero and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under
our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. The
pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract
durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three years were insignificant.

were $317 million in 2021, $170 million in 2020 and $488 million in 2019. Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax
share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such
charges was $259 million in 2021, $611 million in 2020 and $339 million in 2019.
K-56
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Other (Continued)
After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in
connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment
of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020
included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were
recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical Accounting Policies on page K-62 for additional
details.
Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and
BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses
from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be
significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Berkshire
corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany
interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes.
Financial Condition
Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings
attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $89.8 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately
$61.6 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in
equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our periodic earnings.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares
at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of
shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely.
We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury
Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire.
Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock.
At December 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $143.9
billion, which included $119.6 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our
investment in Kraft Heinz) were $367.2 billion. Our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 included approximately $14.4
billion of investments that mature in 2022 and 2023.
Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2021 were $114.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent
company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated
borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $10.2 in 2022; $14.6 in 2023; $9.7 in 2024; $9.9 in 2025; and $8.7 in
2026.
Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $21.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since
December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen
denominated debt. In 2021, Berkshire repaid Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated debt aggregating approximately $2.2 billion of
maturing senior notes and issued Euro and Yen denominated senior notes aggregating approximately $2.2 billion with maturity
dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of
maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027
to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%.
Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2021,
which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s
borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our
railcar leasing business. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes
due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Financial Condition (Continued)
BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020. During
2021, BNSF repaid $1.54 billion of debt and issued $1.55 billion of debentures with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1% with
maturity dates in 2051 and 2052. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion at December 31, 2021, a
decrease of $382 million since December 31, 2020. In 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately
$2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and repaid term debt of approximately $2.5 billion. Berkshire does not
guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.
In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $39
billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.3 billion in
2021, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $9.5 billion. BNSF
and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant
capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate
$11.1 billion in 2022.
Contractual Obligations
We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to
counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease
liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years
are (in billions): $1.6 in 2022; $1.5 in 2023; $1.4 in 2024; $1.2 in 2025; and $1.2 in 2026.
We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including
amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at December 31, 2021. We currently forecast claim
payments in 2022 of approximately $29 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2022. Additionally, we estimate net
payments of approximately $3 billion in 2022 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount
of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will
likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.
Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not
currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or
services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to
fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft
purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of
approximately $19 billion, including $8 billion in 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023
and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Note 26 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these commitments.
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of
uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the
future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting
policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2021 follows.
Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim
liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The
timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds
and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a
variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions.
As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yet reported.
The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively
short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty
claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial
process further contribute to extending claim-tails.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2021 were
approximately $125 billion, of which 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional
information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these
businesses follows.
GEICO
GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2021, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses
were $23.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $22.7 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies
produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include
projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several
actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.
Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal
injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of
December 31, 2021, case development liabilities averaged approximately 34% of the case reserves. We select case development
factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.
Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected
(reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the
ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims.
We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR
liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.
We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models
and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period
and projects the ultimate cost.
Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, which produced a
corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2021 reflect the most
recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and
severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.
With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at
least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2021. We
estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $290 million increase or decrease in
recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely
cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same
direction.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued
through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written
primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business
written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to
property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.
In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received
from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract
terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.
The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess
contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with
respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis.
Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR
loss estimates.
Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally
required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S.,
reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of
the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims
reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage,
contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other
reasons.
As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a
risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal
procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance
contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit
the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by
our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our
contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for
which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our
clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case
losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2021, our case loss estimates
exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $700 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring
over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case
estimates.
Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of
actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data
and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to
reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social
and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following
categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:
K-60
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development
patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to,
changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy
terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that
result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.
Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected
patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected
unpaid or unreported losses.
Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the
anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and
techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated
with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.
Additional analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis,
determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an
anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to
reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected
loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include
estimates of known major catastrophe events.
Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and
incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual
risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for
estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the
individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.
For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the
business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid
or incurred development pattern indications.
In 2021, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated
ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $136 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss
emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.0 billion in IBNR liabilities,
producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at
these rates.
For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate
liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $375 million in 2021. For certain significant casualty and general liability
portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected
loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of
approximately $950 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $950 million are possible given the diversification in
worldwide business.
The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts
assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1
billion at December 31, 2021. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment
and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of
liability emerge.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Retroactive reinsurance
Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities
associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-
tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2021, gross unpaid losses were $38.3 billion and deferred charges were $10.6 billion.
Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum
remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $54 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative
changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop
upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability.
We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our
liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various
scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor
subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying
losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are
revealed.
Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated
liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed
data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or
aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of
ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends
and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory
environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact
on our ultimate liabilities.
We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million in 2021, which
after the changes in related deferred charges, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $142 million. In 2021, we paid losses and loss
adjustment expenses of $1.9 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts.
In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception
represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred
charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments.
We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the
effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on
unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that amortization
expense in 2022 will approximate $950 million.
Other Critical Accounting Policies
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.9 billion and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an
interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our
reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include
forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs.
Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment
reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time,
actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair
value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an
impairment loss.
K-62
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)
As of December 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the
severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, as well as other assumptions concerning the
long-term economic performance of the reporting unit, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in
such instances can be subject to wide variations.
We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions
and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an
appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting
unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.
In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair values
of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was
Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value
of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four
other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying
value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion.
In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most
significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-
lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the
reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-
related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in
connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and
aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not
limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders,
announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production, and the actions we were taking or may be taking in the future to
restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and
reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments.
Market Risk Disclosures
Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market
risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections
address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.
Equity Price Risk
Equity securities represent a significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in
businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each
company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2021, approximately
73% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four companies.
We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in
the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety
against short-term price volatility.
K-63
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Equity Price Risk (Continued)
We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts, although our equity price
exposure has declined significantly as a vast majority of the contracts written to date have expired. Our ultimate liability with
respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and
expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors.
The following table summarizes our equity securities and equity index put option contract liabilities as of December 31,
2021 and 2020 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The
selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could
be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment
portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

      30% decrease  2,702   (1,293)
 
(1) The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date.
Interest Rate Risk
We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such
instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of
business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit
ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage
interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.
The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will
fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risks associated with the valuations of our equity index put
option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31,
2021. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments.
Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment
options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions.

determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios.

Commodity Price Risk
Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price
risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and
services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our
operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any
significant degree.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, as required by
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-67.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’
equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
K-67
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) under short duration property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance contracts are $86,664 million as of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions affecting certain claim
liabilities include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment
emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were
appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2021, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,
including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions.
• We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by:
 • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned
premium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.
 • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential
bias in the determination of the claim liabilities.
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
 • We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as
needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.
 • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the
reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 17 to the
financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactive reinsurance
contracts are $38,256 million as of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities and related deferred
charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”) include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected loss payment
emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were
appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2021, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,
including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities and related assets included the following, among
others:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities and related assets, including those over the key
assumptions.
K-68
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)
• We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities and related assets by:
 • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the
inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.
 • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential
bias in the determination of the claim liabilities and related assets.
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
 • We developed independent claim liability estimates for certain retroactive reinsurance contracts and compared our
estimates to management’s estimates. For other retroactive reinsurance contracts and related assets, we evaluated the
process used by management to develop the estimated claim liabilities and related assets.
 • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates, assessed
unexpected development and assessed internal rates of return.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair
value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of
each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests.
The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair
value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings
before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair
value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of December 31, 2021. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the
PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fair values and
carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to
forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an
increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the PCC reporting
unit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others:
 • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the
forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate.
 • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year forecasts to
actual results in the respective years.
 • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts to
historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’
disclosures.
 • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth rates
and discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy
of the calculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-
term growth rates and discount rate selected by management.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2021
 
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices
 (a)Nature of operations and basis of consolidation
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse
business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing,
service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 25. Information concerning business
acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and
Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures
and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the
accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date.
Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable
interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its
economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right
to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
 (b)Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in
projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges
on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from
the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect
our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected nearly all of our operations during
2020, although the effects varied significantly. The extent of the effects over longer terms on the demand for certain of our
products and services cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation
of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed
under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.
 (c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills
Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three
months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities
exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
 (d)Investments in fixed maturity securities
We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities
classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity.
Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes
in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
Substantially all of investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference
between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method.
K-75
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (d)Investments in fixed maturity securities (Continued)
We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold,
determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for
the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we
evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the
decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to
the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash
flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased
based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit
loss is recognized in other comprehensive income.
 (e)Investments in equity securities
We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values
in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or losses.
 (f) Investments under the equity method
We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence,
but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is
presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be
overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is
restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments
possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock.
In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying
amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the
investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses
reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk,
even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are
based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value.
 (g)Loans and finance receivables
Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and
site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances for
expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination
and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized as yield
adjustments over the lives of the loans.
Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts
and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection,
whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value
of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans
and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are
performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates,
interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until
foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable
forecasts.
Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due
on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to
the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than
90 days delinquent.
Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of
foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is
complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the
collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the
future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (h)Other receivables
Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses
recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are
primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance
recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored
insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property
and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for
uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectible balances when it was probable counterparties
or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and historical loss history.
Beginning in 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for credit
losses. In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or
expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience.
In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the
counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement
including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all
reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
 (i) Derivatives
We carry derivative contracts in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair
value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if
such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates
is probable.
 (j) Fair value measurements
As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists.
Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair
value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be
independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance
or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting
market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.
 (k)Inventories
Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale.
Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2021, we
used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 31% of consolidated inventories with the remainder
primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost
or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately
$1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.
 (l) Property, plant and equipment
We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions,
improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as
certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed
assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized
costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance
the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property,
extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (l) Property, plant and equipment (Continued)
Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods
where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a
composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or
salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is
recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.
We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily
using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our
other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and
furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad
business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other
equipment – 6 to 43 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses
are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets
– 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years.
We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering
event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value
from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable
amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to
impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in
evaluating the carrying value.
 (m)Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property from
others (“lessee” contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We
depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power
of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent
with policies for property, plant and equipment.
When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate.
The lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or
other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-
of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental
borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted
under GAAP, we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and do not record assets or
liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.
 (n)Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that
business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the
fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market
quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected
future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including
goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair
values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with
finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the
estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (o)Revenue recognition
We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss
exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. Premiums are generally earned in proportion to
the coverage provided, which is generally ratable over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a
monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are generally received in
full and are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to
contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for
periodic payment annuity contracts are usually received in full at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated
net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss
experience under such contracts.
Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is
transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we
expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.
We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts
provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under
the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may
contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance
obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or
service.
Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may
be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed
to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue
excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for
shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat
consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue.
Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the
customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement.
We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings,
forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the
customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the
customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract.
The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a
point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series
of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are
based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which
are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing
quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified
destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously
receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as
of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within
30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping
to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future
customer shipments.
K-79
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (o)Revenue recognition (Continued)
Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory
commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and
have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is
delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business.
Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the
customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due
within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual
arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance
obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator,
certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Other service revenues
derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and
consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues
primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news
distribution.
Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the
terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases.
 (p)Losses and loss adjustment expenses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance
contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated
ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value.
We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and
(3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment
expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance
contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect
to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts.
 (q)Retroactive reinsurance contracts
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance
contracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to
retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the
excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred
charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or
amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates
retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
 (r) Insurance policy acquisition costs
We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate
recoverability. For short duration contracts, we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related
premiums are earned. Acquisition costs related to long duration life insurance contracts are amortized over the expected
premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated premiums over the life of the policy. Such anticipated premiums are
estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits. Direct incremental acquisition
costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other
underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs generally reflects
anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were approximately
$3.4 billion and $3.25 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

 (s) Life and annuity insurance benefits
We compute liabilities for benefits under life insurance contracts based upon estimated future investment yields,
expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates, as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and
expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and
may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate
assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit
rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates for
most contracts range from 3% to 7%.
 (t) Regulated utilities and energy businesses
Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated
operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the
requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain
costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities
will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods.
Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by
considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated
entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory
rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers.
 (u)Foreign currency
The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other
than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars
at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the
reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated
in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of
assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings.
 (v)Income taxes
Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In
addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax
liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for
the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax
bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with
components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise,
changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on
deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax
expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is
not likely.
Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax
returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of
the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax
expense.

 (w)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1,
2020. ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost
based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for
non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when
non-collection was considered probable. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $388
million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses.
 (x)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019
Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019 with respect to contracts in effect as of the adoption and
elected to not restate prior period financial statements. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability
to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Upon
adoption, we recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $6.2 billion, lease liabilities of $5.9 billion and
reduced other assets by approximately $300 million.    
 
 (y)New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2021
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted
Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of
cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing
policyholder liabilities and related deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts. The
effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate
assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions are set at
the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied
retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements, requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted.
We currently intend to adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method, which
provides that the revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) be applied to
contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulative effects from discount
rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and the
cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be included in retained earnings. While we have not finalized our
assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we currently believe that the changes in discount rate
assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities than changes in cash flow assumptions. We also
preliminarily estimate that the changes in discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 will increase our life, health and
annuity benefit liabilities from the amounts previously reported due to the historically low interest rate environment at that
time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions
determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We, therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on
our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Business acquisitions
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and
able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial
Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.
Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired certain businesses of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) on November 1,
2020, pursuant to a definitive agreement with Dominion in July 2020. The acquired businesses included natural gas transmission,
gathering and storage pipelines, natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and
storage facility (“Cove Point”). In October 2020, BHE and Dominion also agreed to provide for the exclusion of certain pipeline
businesses from the initial agreement and entered into a second acquisition agreement with respect to the excluded pipeline
businesses. The closing of the second agreement was subject to regulatory and customary closing conditions; however, in July
2021, BHE and Dominion agreed to terminate the second agreement.

(2)Business acquisitions (Continued)
The cost of the acquisition was approximately $2.5 billion after post-closing adjustments as provided in the agreement. The
fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill are summarized as follows (in millions).
 
Property, plant and equipment $ 9,264 
Goodwill  1,741 
Other  2,398 
Assets acquired $ 13,403 
    
Notes payable and other borrowings $ 5,615 
Other  1,358 
Liabilities assumed  6,973 
Noncontrolling interests  3,916 
Net assets $ 2,514
 
 
As part of this acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25% economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100% of the general
partnership interest and 25% of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that we have the power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and receive
benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary. The noncontrolling
interests are attributable to the limited partner interests held by third parties.
In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as “bolt-
ons” to several of our existing business operations. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individually or in the
aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments in commercial, industrial and other equity securities include our investments in Occidental Corporation
(“Occidental”), which we acquired in 2019. These investments were acquired for a total of $10 billion and consist of Occidental
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion and warrants, which currently permit us to
purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 per share. The preferred stock
accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal
to 105% of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and is mandatorily redeemable under certain
specified events. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock.
(5)Equity method investments
Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method.
Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft
Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces,
cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 26.6% of the
outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock.
We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $269 million in 2021, $95 million in 2020 and
$493 million in 2019. Equity method earnings included the effects of goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges
recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our share of such charges was approximately $350 million in 2021, $850 million in 2020 and $450
million in 2019. We received dividends from Kraft Heinz of $521 million in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, which we recorded as
reductions in our carrying value.
Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $11.7
billion at December 31, 2021 and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment was approximately
$13.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our
investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by approximately 11% of the carrying value. We evaluated our
investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded recognition of an
impairment charge in earnings was not required as of December 31, 2021.

Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage
LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”), Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”) and beginning in 2021, Iroquois
Gas Transmission System L.P. (“Iroquois”). The aggregate carrying value of our investments in these entities was $4.3 billion as of
December 31, 2021 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our equity method earnings in these entities were $726 million in
2021, $631 million in 2020 and $683 million in 2019. During 2021, we received distributions of approximately $1.2 billion from
these investees. Additional information concerning these investments follows.
We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia
is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S.
government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial
institutions. Berkadia funds a portion of its operations through commercial paper borrowings, which are currently limited to
$1.5 billion. On December 31, 2021, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is
supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any
losses incurred under the policy. BHE subsidiaries own a 50% noncontrolling interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric
transmission assets in Texas and a 50% noncontrolling interest in Iroquois, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline located
in New York and Connecticut.
We own a 38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in
North America with more than 800 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale
distribution. Pilot’s revenues in 2021 were approximately $45 billion. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot
and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We have an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot
with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

(6)Investment and derivative contract gains/losses (Continued)
Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the year on equity
securities we still owned at the end of the year, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the year. As reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $15.8 billion in 2021, $38.8 billion in 2020 and
$14.3 billion in 2019 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold
during the year represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning
of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the
difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains were $3.6 billion in 2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2
billion in 2019.
The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four
major equity indexes. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions).

Notional value   6,992   10,991 
Intrinsic value   —   727 
Weighted average remaining life (in years)   0.5   1.2
 
Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each
index is zero on each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based
on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Contracts comprising 63% of the notional
value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be
required if the index value is below the contract strike price at the contract expiration date. We received aggregate premiums on the
contract inception dates of $1.3 billion with respect to unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2021 and we have no counterparty
credit risk.

We are also party to commercial loan agreements with Seritage Growth Properties (“Seritage”) and Lee Enterprises, Inc,
(“Lee”), in which loan balances aggregated $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The Seritage
loan is pursuant to a $2.0 billion term loan facility and the outstanding loan is secured by mortgages on its real estate properties.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, the loan agreement with Seritage was amended to allow optional loan prepayments without
penalty and on December 31, 2021, Seritage made a loan prepayment of $160 million. The amendments further provide Seritage
with the option to extend the maturity of the loan to July 31, 2025, if the outstanding principal has been reduced to $800 million by
the original expiration date of July 31, 2023. The loan to Lee matures in 2045 and was made in connection with its acquisition of
our newspaper operations and the repayment by Lee of its then outstanding credit facilities. We are the sole lender to each of these
entities and each of these loans is current as to payment status.

(12)Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property from others under contracts classified as operating leases. We primarily
lease office and operating facilities, locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. The weighted
average remaining term of our operating leases was approximately 7.2 years at December 31, 2021 and 7.3 years at December 31,
2020. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets and were $5,091 million at December 31, 2021 and
$5,579 million at December 31, 2020. Our lease liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were
$4,991 million at December 31, 2021 and $5,469 million at December 31, 2020. The weighted average discount rate used to
measure lease liabilities was approximately 3.5% at December 31, 2021 and 3.6% at December 31, 2020. A summary of our
remaining future operating lease payments reconciled to lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 follows

During 2020, we reevaluated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment
due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believed most significantly affected the air travel,
commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $10 billion and
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $10 billion of
these charges pertained to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), one of the largest businesses within Berkshire’s manufacturing
segment. The carrying values of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges were
approximately $31 billion. The impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flow methods and reflected our
assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significant judgment is required in estimating the
fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows
and earnings, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts.

(15)Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries
Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior
regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $30 billion as ordinary dividends during
2022. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance
authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $6.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and $5.5 billion at
December 31, 2020.
Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules
(Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $301 billion at December 31, 2021 and $237 billion at December 31, 2020.
Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP, due to differences in accounting for certain assets and
liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain
investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the
carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully
recognized for statutory reporting purposes.

(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and
casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences
as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in
claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the three years ending

Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured
events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”).
Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses
included approximately $2.9 billion in 2021, $950 million in 2020 and $1.0 billion in 2019 from significant catastrophe events
(losses in excess of $100 million per event) occurring in the respective year. Current accident year incurred losses from private
passenger auto insurance also increased significantly in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased claims frequencies
and severities. In 2020, current accident year incurred losses reflected low private passenger auto claims frequencies and increased
loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and reinsurance business attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $3.1 billion in 2021, $356 million in
2020 and $752 million in 2019, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those
periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 4.0% in 2021, 0.5% in 2020 and
1.1% in 2019.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance were reduced by $2.4 billion in 2021, $518
million in 2020 and $457 million in 2019. The reductions in 2021 and 2020 derived primarily from private passenger auto and
medical professional liability claims. In both 2021 and 2020, we also lowered estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years
with respect to workers’ compensation claims, which were largely offset by increases in ultimate liabilities for other casualty
claims. The decrease in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2019 reflected reductions in medical professional liability and
workers’ compensation estimates partially offset by higher other casualty estimates. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident
years related to property and casualty reinsurance decreased $718 million in 2021, increased $162 million in 2020 and decreased
$295 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 included increased claims estimates for legacy casualty exposures.

(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures were approximately $2.1 billion
at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We
are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims.
Disaggregated information concerning our claims liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. The effects of
businesses acquired or disposed during the year are reflected in the data presented on a retrospective basis. A reconciliation of the

GEICO
GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage
claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and
techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in
loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates.
We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to
establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large
volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability
claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated.
Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, primarily due to
the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first
established. The “claim-tail” is the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date. Consequently,
we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims,
IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant
coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported
claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in
certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.

GEICO’s net incurred and paid auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year below.
IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in
a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus
may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for
all auto policy coverages. Dollars are in millions.

BH Primary
BH Primary’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily derive from medical professional liability
and workers’ compensation and other casualty insurance, which includes commercial auto and general liability insurance. Net
incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional
liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of
December 31, 2021. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that
ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions.
Medical Professional Liability
We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities
using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and
Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected
loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In
addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent developments based upon
claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty
We periodically evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for the workers’ compensation and other
casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-
ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the
different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also
separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims
investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the
claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis
liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

BHRG
We use a variety of methodologies to establish BHRG’s estimates for property and casualty claims liabilities. These
methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and
frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.
Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR
liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of
the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may
establish case liabilities based on our estimates.
K-95
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are
evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for
major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss
event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable.
Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-
tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to
multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may
not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages
based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year. IBNR
and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. Dollars are in millions.

(17)Retroactive reinsurance contracts
Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance
contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence
immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of
the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and
related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021 follow (in millions).

In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the
contracts, which reflect when our exposures to losses began. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident
year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further,
we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities have little or no practical analytical value.
Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain
subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities with regard to the
AIG contract were approximately $15.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and $17.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Claim payments
under this contract commenced in 2021 and were $1.2 billion during 2021. Deferred charges related to the AIG contract were
approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2020.
Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $845 million in 2021, $907
million in 2020 and $1,188 million in 2019, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in
the timing and amount of expected future loss payments.
In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project
losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts,
with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information
concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when
significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes.
Estimated claim liabilities for retroactive reinsurance included estimates for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury
exposures of approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Retroactive reinsurance
contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise
limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government
regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors
could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate
the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.

During 2021, Berkshire repaid €550 million and $1.5 billion of maturing senior notes and issued €600 million of 0.5% senior
notes due in 2041 and ¥160 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and
a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing debt and issued ¥128.5 billion
(approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of
0.5%.
Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund
manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million
of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051.
The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.9 billion, £1.75 billion and
¥785.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes
in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.3 billion in 2021, pre-tax losses of $1.0 billion in 2020 and pre-tax gains of
$192 million in 2019.
Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021.
Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the
full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of
certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing
arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios
and/or debt service coverage ratios. During 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $2.2 billion with
maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.2% and repaid $2.5 billion of term debt.

BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During 2021, BNSF issued $1.55 billion of term debt with
maturity dates in 2051 and 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1% and repaid debt of $1.54 billion. As of December 31,
2021, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any
debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries.
Our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support short-term borrowing programs and
provide additional liquidity. Unused lines of credit were approximately $10.4 billion at December 31, 2021, which included
approximately $8.7 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

We have not established deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which
are expected to be reinvested indefinitely. Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable
to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes
will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign
jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes.

We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax
liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011. The U.S. federal income tax returns from 2012
through 2019 remain open, and tax years 2014 through 2019 are under audit. We are also under audit or subject to audit with
respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax
examinations will be settled in 2022. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to
our Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, net unrecognized tax benefits were $1,046 million and $1,113 million, respectively.
Included in the balance at December 31, 2021, were $878 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax
rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is
highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting,
these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate. Other differences, net included expense of
$60 million in 2020 and $377 million in 2019 for uncertain tax positions related to investments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity
investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We concluded it was more likely than not those
income tax benefits are not valid. We do not expect any material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits
during 2022.

(20)Fair value measurements (Continued)
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The
hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.
Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.
Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged
in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as
interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that
are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations
generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar
characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same
industry sector.
Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is
required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets
or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to
make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets
or liabilities.
Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 follow (in millions).

(20)Fair value measurements (Continued)
Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred and common stock
warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as defined under GAAP. These investments are subject to contractual
restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We
applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration
of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant
valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and
volatility of the warrants.

Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution
rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses
voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under
Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common
stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not
convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,477,429 shares outstanding as
of December 31, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are
economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding
represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding.
Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A
shares outstanding.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren
Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe
that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share
repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to
be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash
equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase
any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the
customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with
our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customer contract revenues
disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021 (in
millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily
insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.

(23)Pension plans
Certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Benefits under the plans are generally based on years of
service and compensation or fixed benefit rates. Plan sponsors may make contributions to the plans to meet regulatory requirements
and may also make discretionary contributions. The components of our net periodic pension expense for each of the three years
ending December 31, 2021 follow (in millions).

Net periodic pension expense  $ (138) $ (39) $ (68)
 
The projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and
compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Benefit
obligations under qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in trusts. Pension obligations under
certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded and the aggregate PBOs of such plans were $1.4 billion and $1.6
billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cost of certain BHE pension plans are expected to be recoverable
through the regulated rate making process.
The funded status at year end 2021 and 2020 and reconciliations of the changes in PBOs and plan assets related to BHE’s
pension plans and all other pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2021 follow (in millions).

See Note 20 for a discussion of the three levels of fair value measurements. Plan assets are generally invested with the long-
term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk.
Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan
assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given
significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience
will differ from the assumed rates of return.

Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans.
Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for employer
matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by
management. Our defined contribution plan expense was approximately $1.0 billion in 2021, $1.4 billion in 2020 and $1.2 billion
in 2019.

(25)Business segment data
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We
organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain
businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and
distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management.
The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated
Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those
transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and
derivative gains/losses, impairments or amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s
business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units.
Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts.
Berkshire’s operating segments are as follows.
 
Business Identity   Business Activity  
Insurance:   
GEICO  Underwriting private passenger automobile insurance mainly by direct
response methods
  
 
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  Underwriting multiple lines of property and casualty insurance policies for
primarily commercial accounts
  
 
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group  Underwriting excess-of-loss, quota-share and facultative reinsurance
worldwide

Consolidated sales, service and leasing revenues were $151.0 billion in 2021, $132.3 billion in 2020 and $140.8 billion in
2019. Sales, service and leasing revenues attributable to the United States were 85% in 2021, 86% in 2020 and 85% in 2019 of
such amounts. The remainder of sales, service and leasing revenues were primarily in Europe, Canada and the Asia Pacific region.
Railroad, utilities and energy revenues were $48.1 billion in 2021, $41.8 billion in 2020 and $43.5 billion in 2019. In each of the
three years, approximately 96% of such revenues were attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2021, approximately 89%
of our consolidated net property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease was located in the United States with the
remainder primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom.
(26)Contingencies and Commitments
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions
seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by
Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine
litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are
also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We
believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.
Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of goods and
services used in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our
long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our shared aircraft ownership and leasing
business. As of December 31, 2021, estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows: $8 billion in 2022,
$4 billion in 2023, $3 billion in 2024, $2 billion in 2025, $2 billion in 2026 and $15 billion after 2026.
As indicated in Note 5, we have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% ownership interest in Pilot in 2023. At that
time, Pilot will become a consolidated subsidiary. Additionally, we may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in
less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders. The
timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are contingent on future
actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired. If we had acquired the additional interest in Pilot
and all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2021, we estimate the aggregate cost of these acquisitions would
approximate $11 billion.

when due of all present and future payment obligations. The Parent Company has also provided guarantees in connection with
certain retroactive reinsurance contracts issued by subsidiaries. The amounts of subsidiary payments under these contracts, if any, is
contingent upon the outcome of future events.
