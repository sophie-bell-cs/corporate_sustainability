ITEM 1.    Business
OVERVIEW
Visa is one of the world’s leaders in digital payments. Our purpose is to uplift everyone, everywhere
by being the best way to pay and be paid. We facilitate global commerce and money movement across
more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, ﬁnancial
institutions and government entities through innovative technologies.
Since Visa’s early days in 1958, we have been in the business of facilitating payments between
consumers and businesses. We are focused on extending, enhancing and investing in our proprietary
advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, to oﬀer a single connection point for facilitating
payment transactions to multiple endpoints through various form factors. As a network of networks
enabling global movement of money through all available networks, we are working to provide payment
solutions and services for everyone, everywhere. Through our network, we oﬀer products, solutions and
services that facilitate secure, reliable and eﬃcient money movement for participants in the ecosystem.
•We facilitate secure, reliable and eﬃcient money movement among consumers,
issuing and acquiring ﬁnancial institutions and merchants. We have traditionally referred
to this structure as the “four-party” model. Please see Our Core Business discussion below. As the
payments ecosystem continues to evolve, we have broadened this model to include digital banks,
digital wallets and a range of ﬁnancial technology companies (ﬁntechs), governments and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). We provide transaction processing services (primarily
authorization, clearing and settlement) to our ﬁnancial institution and merchant clients through
VisaNet. During ﬁscal year 2023, 276 billion payments and cash transactions with Visa’s brand
were processed by Visa or other networks, equating to an average of 757 million transactions per
day. Of the 276 billion total transactions, 213 billion were processed by Visa.
•We oﬀer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products that our clients, including
14,500 ﬁnancial institutions, use to develop and oﬀer payment solutions or services, including
credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for individual, business and government account
holders. During ﬁscal year 2023, Visa’s total payments and cash volume was $15 trillion, and 4.3
billion payment credentials, which are issued Visa card accounts that were available worldwide to
be used at more than 130 million merchant locations.
•We take an open partnership approach and seek to provide value by enabling access to our
global network, including oﬀering our technology capabilities through application programming
interfaces (APIs). We partner with both traditional and emerging players to innovate and expand
the payments ecosystem, allowing them to use the resources of our platform to scale and grow
their businesses more quickly and eﬀectively.
•We are accelerating the migration to digital payments through our network of networks
strategy. We aim to provide a single connection point so that Visa clients can enable money
movement for businesses, governments and consumers, regardless of which network is used to
start or complete the transaction. This model ultimately helps to unify a complex payments
ecosystem. Visa’s network of networks approach creates opportunities by facilitating person-to-
person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and government-to-
consumer (G2C) payments, in addition to consumer to business (C2B) payments.
•We provide value added services to our clients, including issuing solutions, acceptance
solutions, risk and identity solutions, open banking and advisory services.
•We invest in and promote our brand to the beneﬁt of our clients and partners through
advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives with the International Olympic Committee,
the International Paralympic Committee and the National Football League (NFL), among others.
We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment innovations.
 The number includes an estimated 30 million locations through payment facilitators, which are technology
providers that provide payment acceptance services to merchants on behalf of acquir ers. Data provided to Visa by
acquiring institutions and other thir d parties as of June 30, 2023.(1)

FISCAL YEAR 2023 KEY STATISTICS
Please see Item 7 of this report for a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP ﬁnancial results.
OUR CORE BUSINESS
In a typical Visa C2B payment transaction, the consumer purchases goods or services from a
merchant using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an
acquirer, usually a bank or third-party processing ﬁrm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or
payment products, for veriﬁcation and processing. Through VisaNet, the acquirer presents the
transaction data to Visa, which in turn sends the transaction data to the issuer to check the account
holder’s account balance or credit line for authorization. After the transaction is authorized, the issuer
posts the transaction to the consumer’s account and eﬀectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to
the value of the transaction, minus the interchange reimbursement fee. The acquirer pays the amount of
the purchase, minus the merchant discount rate (MDR), to the merchant.
Visa earns revenue by facilitating money movement across more than 200 countries and territories
among a global set of consumers, merchants, ﬁnancial institutions and government entities through
innovative technologies.(1)

Figure may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.
Please see Item 7 and Note 1—Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this
report, which include disclosures on how we earn and recognize our revenues.
Visa provides payment processing for both non-Visa-branded and Visa-branded card transactions. In
the context of non-Visa-branded card transactions, we facilitate payment processing by providing
gateway routing services to other payment networks. At the client’s request, we may provide
authorization, clearing or settlement services on our network before or after we route the transaction to
the other payments network. In those instances, Visa may earn data processing revenues for the speciﬁc
services provided. In the context of Visa-branded card transactions on our network, we provide
authorization, clearing and settlement services and may earn service, data processing, international
transaction, or other revenues. Depending on applicable regulations, some payment processors may or
may not use our network to process Visa-branded card transactions. If they use our network, we may
earn service revenues and data processing revenues. If they do not use our network, we earn only
service revenues.
Visa is not a ﬁnancial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for
account holders of Visa products nor do we earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of
these activities. Interchange reimbursement fees reﬂect the value merchants receive from accepting our
products and play a key role in balancing the costs and beneﬁts that account holders and merchants
derive from participating in our payments networks. Generally, interchange reimbursement fees are paid
by acquirers to issuers. We establish default interchange reimbursement fees that apply absent other
established settlement terms. These default interchange reimbursement fees are set independently from
the revenues we receive from issuers and acquirers. Our acquiring clients are responsible for setting the
fees they charge to merchants for the MDR and for soliciting merchants. Visa sets fees to acquirers
independently from any fees that acquirers may charge merchants. Therefore, the fees we receive from
issuers and acquirers are not derived from interchange reimbursement fees or MDRs.(1)

Table of Contents
Visa’s strategy is to accelerate our revenue growth in consumer payments, new ﬂows and value
added services, and fortify the key foundations of our business model.
We seek to accelerate revenue growth in three primary areas — consumer payments, new ﬂows and
value added services.
Consumer Payments
We remain focused on moving trillions of dollars of consumer spending in cash and checks to cards
and digital accounts on Visa’s network of networks.
Core Products
Visa’s growth has been driven by the strength of our core products — credit, debit and prepaid.
Credit: Credit cards and digital credentials allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay
for goods and services. Credit cards are aﬃliated with programs operated by ﬁnancial institution
clients, co-brand partners, ﬁntechs and aﬃnity partners.
Debit: Debit cards and digital credentials allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods
and services using funds held in their deposit accounts. Debit cards enable account holders to
transact in person, online or via mobile without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line
of credit. The Visa/PLUS Global ATM network also provides debit, credit and prepaid account holders
with cash access, and other banking capabilities, in more than 200 countries and territories
worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both ﬁnancial institutions and
independent ATM operators.
7
Table of Contents
Prepaid: Prepaid cards and digital credentials draw from a designated balance funded by
individuals, businesses or governments. Prepaid cards address many use cases and needs, including
general purpose reloadable, payroll, government and corporate disbursements, healthcare, gift and
travel. Visa-branded prepaid cards also play an important part in ﬁnancial inclusion, bringing
payment solutions to those with limited or no access to traditional banking products.
Enablers
We enable consumer payments and help our clients grow as digital commerce, new technologies
and new participants continue to transform the payments ecosystem. Some examples include:
Tap to Pay
As we seek to improve the user experience in the face-to-face environment, contactless payments
or tap to pay, which is the process of tapping a contactless card or mobile device on a terminal to make
a payment, has emerged as a preferred way to pay among consumers in many countries around the
world. Tap to pay adoption is growing and many consumers have come to expect touchless payment
experiences.
Globally, we have 50 countries and territories with more than 90 percent contactless penetration
and more than 100 countries and territories where tap to pay is more than 50 percent of face-to-face
transactions. Excluding the United States, 76 percent of face-to-face transactions globally were
contactless in ﬁscal year 2023. In the U.S., Visa has surpassed 40 percent contactless penetration and
more than 520 million tap-to-pay-enabled Visa cards. We have activated more than 750 contactless
public transport projects worldwide. In addition, we processed more than 1.6 billion contactless
transactions on global transit systems in ﬁscal year 2023, an increase of more than 30 percent year over
year.
Tokenization
Visa Token Service (VTS) brings trust to digital commerce innovation. As consumers increasingly rely
on digital transactions, VTS is designed to enhance the digital ecosystem through improved
authorization, reduced fraud and improved consumer experience. VTS helps protect digital transactions
by replacing 16-digit Visa account numbers with a token that includes a surrogate account number,
cryptographic information and other data to protect the underlying account information. This security
technology can work for a variety of payment transactions, both in person or online.
The provisioning of network tokens continues to accelerate. As of the end of ﬁscal year 2023, Visa
provisioned more than 7.5 billion network tokens, surpassing the number of physical cards in circulation.
The milestone reinforces Visa’s commitment to secure, reliable and eﬃcient money movement, in
person and online.
Click to Pay
Click to Pay provides a simpliﬁed and more consistent cardholder checkout experience online by
removing time-consuming key entry of personal information and enabling consumer and transaction
data to be passed securely between payments network participants. Based on the EMV Secure Remote
Commerce industry standard, Click to Pay brings a standardized and streamlined approach to online
checkout and meets the needs of consumers shopping across a growing number of connected devices.
The goal of Click to Pay is to make digital payments as secure, reliable and interoperable as the checkout
experience in person.®

New Flows
New ﬂows focus on facilitating commercial and global money movement across Visa’s network of
networks. This approach creates opportunities to capture new sources of money movement through card
and non-card ﬂows for consumers, businesses and governments around the world by facilitating P2P,
B2C, B2B and G2C payments.
Visa Direct
Visa Direct is part of Visa’s strategy beyond C2B payments and helps facilitate the delivery of funds
to eligible cards, deposit accounts and digital wallets across more than 190 countries and territories.
Visa Direct supports multiple use cases, such as P2P payments and account-to-account transfers,
business and government payouts to individuals or small businesses, merchant settlements and refunds.
Visa Direct utilizes more than 70 domestic payment schemes, 10 real-time payments schemes, 15
card-based networks and ﬁve payment gateways, with the potential to reach more than 8.5 billion cards,
deposit accounts and digital wallets. In ﬁscal year 2023, Visa Direct processed more than 7.5 billion
transactions across more than 2,800 global programs. Visa Direct solutions supported more than 500
partners across more than 65 use cases. We also announced in ﬁscal year 2023 Visa’s partnership with
DailyPay, i2C, PayPal, TabaPay, Venmo and Western Union to pilot Visa+, an innovative service that aims
to help individuals send money quickly and securely between diﬀerent participating P2P digital payment
apps.
We continue to build on our network of networks strategy by investing in our own capabilities with
Visa+ and Visa Alias Directory Service, which oﬀers capabilities to our clients to link aliases, such as
mobile numbers or email addresses, to payment credentials, as well as strategically collaborating with
digital and mobile payment providers to expand the reach of Visa Direct and deliver even stronger
domestic and cross-border payment and connection capabilities to our clients.
Visa Commercial Solutions
We are also expanding our network with B2B payments. Our three strategic areas of focus include
investing in and growing card-based payments, accelerating our eﬀorts in non-card, cross-border
payments and digitizing domestic accounts payable and accounts receivable processes. We oﬀer a
portfolio of commercial payment solutions, including small business, corporate (travel) cards, purchasing
cards, virtual cards and digital credentials, non-card cross-border B2B payment options and
disbursement accounts, covering most major industry segments around the world. These solutions are
designed to bring eﬃciency, controls and automation to small businesses, commercial and government
payment processes, ranging from employee travel to fully integrated, invoice-based payables.
Visa B2B Connect is a multilateral B2B cross-border payments network designed to facilitate
transactions from the bank of origin directly to the beneﬁciary bank, helping streamline settlement and
optimize payments for ﬁnancial institutions’ corporate clients. The network delivers B2B cross-border
payments that are reliable, ﬂexible, data-rich, secure and cost-eﬀective. Visa B2B Connect continues to
scale and is available in more than 100 countries and territories.
Visa Cross-Border Solutions
Formerly Treasury as a Service, Visa Cross-Border Solutions aligns with our global network of
networks strategy, as we are focused on building the infrastructure that enables our clients of all sizes to
deliver cross-border products with visibility, speed and security. This includes a series of solutions for our
established cross-border consumer payments business, as well as use cases enabled by our digitally
native Currencycloud platform, which includes real-time foreign exchange rates, virtual accounts, and
enhanced liquidity and settlement capabilities.

Value Added Services
Value added services represent an opportunity for us to diversify our revenue with products and
solutions that diﬀerentiate our network, deepen our client relationships and deliver innovative solutions
across other networks.
Issuing Solutions
Visa DPS is one of the largest issuer processors of Visa debit transactions in the world. In addition to
multi-network transaction processing, Visa DPS also provides a wide range of value added services,
including fraud mitigation, dispute management, data analytics, campaign management, a suite of
digital solutions and contact center services. Our capabilities in API-based issuer processing solutions,
like DPS Forward, allow our clients to create new payments use cases and provide them with modular

We also provide a range of other services and digital solutions to issuers, such as account controls,
digital issuance, and branded consumer experiences. Additionally, Visa provides loyalty and beneﬁts
solution to issuers aimed at creating compelling and diﬀerentiated cardholder experiences, as well as
Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) capabilities. BNPL or installment payments allow shoppers the ﬂexibility to
pay for a purchase in equal payments over a deﬁned period of time. Visa is investing in installments as a
payments strategy — by oﬀering a portfolio of BNPL solutions for traditional clients, as well as
installments providers, who use our cards and services to support a wide variety of installment options
before, during or after checkout, in person and online.
Acceptance Solutions
Visa Acceptance Solutions, which includes Cybersource, provides modular, value added services in
addition to the traditional gateway function of connecting merchants to payment processing. Using the
platform, acquirers, payment service providers, independent software vendors, and merchants of all
sizes can improve the way their consumers engage and transact; help to mitigate fraud and lower
operational costs; and adapt to changing business requirements. They can also connect with other
ﬁntechs through a global payment management platform to use their services. Visa Acceptance
Solutions’ capabilities provide new and enhanced payment integrations with ecommerce platforms,
enabling sellers and acquirers to provide tailored commerce experiences with payments seamlessly
embedded. Visa Acceptance Solutions enables an omnichannel solution with a cloud-based architecture
to deliver more innovation at the point of sale.
In addition, Visa provides secure, reliable services for merchants and acquirers that reduce friction
and drive acceptance. Examples include Global Urban Mobility, which supports transit operators to
accept Visa contactless payments in addition to closed-loop payment solutions; and Visa Account
Updater, which provides updated account information for merchants to help strengthen customer
relationships and retention. Visa also oﬀers dispute management services, including a network-agnostic
solution from Veriﬁ that enables merchants to prevent and resolve disputes with a single connection.
Risk and Identity Solutions
Visa’s risk and identity solutions transform data into insights for near real-time decisions and
facilitate account holder authentication to help clients prevent fraud and protect account holder data.
With the increasing popularity of omnichannel commerce and digital payments among consumers, fraud
prevention helps increase trust in digital payments. Solutions such as Visa Advanced Authorization, Visa
Secure, Visa Risk Manager and Decision Manager, Visa Consumer Authentication Service, and payment-
decisioning solutions from CardinalCommerce empower ﬁnancial institutions and merchants with tools
that help automate and simplify fraud prevention and enhance payment security.
Aligned to our network of networks strategy, Visa is increasingly bringing our expertise and
capabilities to emerging fraud challenges, working with network operators and ﬁnancial institutions to
help mitigate fraud. These value-added fraud prevention tools layer on top of a suite of our network
programs that protect the safety and integrity of the payment ecosystem, and along with our
investments in intelligence and technology, help to prevent, detect and mitigate threats. These
programs and Visa’s fraud prevention expertise are among the core beneﬁts of

payment and cyber intelligence, insights and learnings from client or partner breach investigations, and
law enforcement engagement, Visa helps protect ﬁnancial institutions and merchants from fraud and

Open Banking
In March 2022, Visa acquired Tink AB, an open banking platform, to catalyze ﬁntech innovation and
accelerate the development and adoption of open banking securely and at scale. Visa’s open banking
capabilities range from data access use cases, such as account veriﬁcation, balance check and personal
ﬁnance management, to payment initiation capabilities, such as account-to-account transactions and

customers.

networks, our technology platforms, security, brand and talent.
Network of Networks
Our network of networks strategy means moving money to all endpoints and to all form factors,
using all available networks and being a single connection point for our partners; and providing our
value added services on all transactions, no matter the network. The key component of our network of
networks strategy is interoperability. We are opening up our network and increasingly using other
networks to reach accounts we could not otherwise reach and enabling new types of money movement.
Visa B2B Connect, Visa Direct, and Visa+ are examples of our strategy.
Technology Platforms
Visa’s leading technology platforms comprise software, hardware, data centers and
a large telecommunications infrastructure. Visa’s four data centers are a critical part of our global
processing environment and have a high redundancy of network connectivity, power and cooling

turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was 6 percent as of September 30, 2023. Visa employees are
located in more than 80 countries and territories, with 55 percent located outside the U.S. At the end of
ﬁscal year 2023, Visa’s global workforce was 58 percent men and 42 percent women, and women
represented 36 percent of Visa’s leadership (deﬁned as vice president level and above). In the U.S.,
ethnicity of our workforce was 42 percent Asian, 8 percent Black, 13 percent Hispanic, 3 percent Other
and 35 percent White. For our U.S. leadership, the breakdown was 18 percent Asian, 6 percent Black, 13
percent Hispanic, 3 percent Other and 60 percent White.
Given Visa’s ambitious growth agenda and eﬀorts to achieve our purpose, we have focused on
enhancing our employees’ expertise across our business. This includes an enhanced development
program for our senior leaders and a formal technology apprenticeship program to help us broaden and
strengthen our talent channels and pipelines. We have also committed to providing employees with the
tools they need to do their work more quickly and easily, including an artiﬁcial intelligence or AI-driven
portal with a searchable knowledge base to create customized results and bespoke solutions. We
enhanced our mental well-being and retirement beneﬁts, which is reﬂective of our key priority to take
care of our employees.
We also are dedicated to ensuring that employees feel valued in their day-to-day work. During our
global employee engagement survey last year, we learned that our employees wanted more
opportunities to recognize and be recognized, in more informal ways. In response, Visa developed a
program that better enabled employees to provide peer-to-peer recognition for each other’s
contributions. Using UPLIFT, Visa’s new recognition platform, employees can celebrate their peers’
achievements, send e-cards to celebrate the employee journey (from welcoming new hires to
recognizing service anniversaries), use an automated internal networking tool that matches employees
based on smart algorithms, and more. Importantly, all our recognition categories are grounded in
behaviors that reﬂect our employee value proposition or Visa’s Leadership Principles – further reinforcing
that at Visa, it is not only about what you achieve, but how you do it. Employee engagement in peer
recognition has signiﬁcantly increased since the launch, with monthly active users reaching 78 percent
in September 2023, compared to 45 percent in September 2022. With this enhanced platform,
employees are encouraged to recognize and uplift each other.
Visa is committed to pay equity, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity, and conducts pay equity
analyses on an annual basis. We are also committed to transparency – this year, we launched total
rewards statements in the United Kingdom in addition to those already provided in Asia, to drive a
deeper understanding and appreciation of total rewards value to the individual. We plan to introduce
statements in the U.S. as well. For additional information regarding our human capital management,
please see the section titled “Talent and Human Capital Management” in Visa’s 2023 Proxy Statement as
well as our website at visa.com/esg, which includes enhanced workforce disclosures that include our
2022 Consolidated EEO-1 Report and our 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report. See

FINTECH AND DIGITAL PARTNERSHIPS
Fintechs are a vital growth engine for Visa and a key driver in realizing our purpose – to uplift
everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. Fintechs are key enablers of new
payment experiences and new ﬂows. Our work with ﬁntechs is one of our greatest opportunities and has
opened new points of acceptance, extended credit at the point of sale, made cross-border money ﬂows
more eﬃcient, moved B2B spend onto Visa’s network, expedited payroll and provided digital walletTM
customers access to our services. Our portfolio of ﬁntech partners is diverse and continues to grow and
scale. We signed more than 500 commercial partnerships with
12
Table of Contents
ﬁntechs globally, from early stage companies to growing and mature players, an increase of 25 percent
year over year.
To better serve ﬁntechs, Visa has a suite of streamlined commercial programs and digital
onboarding tools. Fintech Fast Track, our ﬂagship program for ﬁntechs is designed to help launch new
ﬁnancial features quickly, such as launching a new card program or enabling the movement of money
with Visa Direct. We provide streamlined onboarding and turnkey access to hundreds of ecosystem
partners. The program has welcomed hundreds of ﬁntechs who are actively engaged in the program.
Visa Ready, our certiﬁcation program, helps technology companies build and launch payment
solutions that meet Visa's global standards around security and functionality. Fintech Partner Connect
helps build pathways between Visa’s issuing clients and ﬁntech providers. With our startup engagement
programs, like the Visa Everywhere Initiative that launched in 2022, early-stage companies can build
payment solutions based on our capabilities. Visa also manages programs including She’s Next,
Empowered by Visa, a global women’s entrepreneurship initiative, and Africa Fintech Accelerator
Program to uplift underrepresented communities.
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
Visa continually explores opportunities to augment our capabilities and provide meaningful value to
our clients. Mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments complement our internal
development and enhance our partnerships to align with Visa’s priorities. Visa applies a rigorous
business analysis to our acquisitions, joint ventures and investments to ensure they will diﬀerentiate our
network, provide value added services and accelerate growth.
In ﬁscal year 2023, we signed a deﬁnitive agreement to acquire Pismo, a cloud-native issuer
processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Paciﬁc and Europe. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and
approvals.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
Visa is committed to operating as a responsible, ethical, inclusive and sustainable company. As one
of the global leaders in digital payments, Visa strives to join with clients, partners and other stakeholders
to empower people, businesses and communities to thrive, to be an industry leader in addressing the
corporate responsibility and sustainability (CRS) topics most signiﬁcant to our role as a payments
technology company, and to meet and exceed our expectations for performance and transparency.
Visa’s purpose is to uplift everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. We believe
deeply in our purpose, and we are focused on empowering people and economies; securing commerce
and protecting customers; investing in our workforce; protecting the planet; and operating responsibly.
Our 2022 ESG Report, as well as other CRS-related resources are available on our website at
visa.com/esg. See Available Information below.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own and manage the Visa brand, which stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed and
reliability. Our portfolio of Visa-owned trademarks is important to our business. Generally, trademark
registrations are valid indeﬁnitely as long as they are in use and/or maintained. We give our clients
access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers, which authorize the use of
our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network. Additionally, we own a
number of patents and patent applications related to our business and continue to pursue patents in
emerging technologies that may have applications in our business. We rely on a combination of patent,
trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as conﬁdentiality
procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology.
COMPETITION
The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Existing and emerging
competitors compete with Visa’s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by
ﬁnancial institutions and merchants. Technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving
growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, blockchain technology and digital currencies.
These advances are enabling new entrants, many
13
Table of Contents
of which depart from traditional network payment models. In certain countries, the evolving regulatory
landscape is creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition.
We compete against all forms of payment. This includes paper-based payments, primarily cash and
checks, and all forms of electronic payments. Our electronic payment competitors principally include:
Global or Multi-Regional Networks: These networks typically oﬀer a range of branded, general
purpose card payment products that consumers can use at millions of merchant locations around the
world. Examples include American Express, Discover, JCB, Mastercard and UnionPay. These competitors
may be more concentrated in speciﬁc geographic regions, such as Discover in the U.S. and JCB in Japan,
or have a leading position in certain countries, such as UnionPay in China. See Item 1A—Regulatory
Risks—Government-imposed obligations and/or restrictions on international payments systems may
prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including signiﬁcant markets such as
China and India. Based on available data, Visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer
networks used throughout the world.
The following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2022:

Includes all consumer, small business and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. American Express, Diners Club /
Discover, and JCB include business from third-party issuers. JCB ﬁgures include other payment-related products and some
ﬁgures are estimates. Mastercard excludes Maestro and Cirrus ﬁgures.
Total volume is the sum of payments volume and cash volume. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions,
balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks.
Local and Regional Networks: Operated in many countries, these networks often have the
support of government inﬂuence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by ﬁnancial institutions or
payment processors. These networks typically focus on debit payment products, and may have strong
local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include NYCE, Pulse and STAR in the U.S., Interac
in Canada and eftpos in Australia.
Alternative Payments Providers: These providers, such as closed commerce ecosystems, BNPL
solutions and cryptocurrency platforms, often have a primary focus of enabling payments through
ecommerce and mobile channels; however, they are expanding or may expand their oﬀerings to the
physical point of sale. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers
between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the ACH, global or local networks like Visa, or
some combination of the foregoing. In some cases, these entities can be both a partner and a
competitor to Visa.
Real-time Payment (RTP) Networks: RTP networks have launched in multiple markets and
continue to be driven by strong government sponsorship and regulatory initiatives to enable and drive
adoption (e.g., FedNow in the U.S., PIX in Brazil and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), increasing
their position as an alternative to payment card schemes. These networks primarily focus on domestic
transactions, with adoption varying by use cases and geographies. However, with linkages such as
PayNow in Singapore and UPI in India, cross-border RTP networks are advancing and will compete with
our cross-border business. RTP networks can compete with Visa on consumer payments and other
payment ﬂows (e.g., B2B and P2P) but can also be customers for value added services, such as risk
management.
Digital Wallet Providers: They continue to expand payment capabilities in person and online for
consumers and merchants and provide consumers with additional ways to pay. While digital wallets can
help drive Visa volumes, they can also be funded by non-card payment options. Digital wallet providers
who utilize RTP networks provide additional competition.
Payment Processors: Payment processors may perform processing services on third-party
payments networks on behalf of issuers or acquirers. We compete with payment processors for the
processing of Visa transactions. These processors may beneﬁt from mandates requiring them to handle
processing under local(1)
(2)

Table of Contents
regulation. For example, as a result of regulation in Europe under the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR),
we may face competition from other networks, processors and other third parties who could process Visa
transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.
New Flows Providers: We compete with alternative solutions to our new ﬂows (e.g., Visa Direct
and Visa B2B Connect) such as ACH, RTP and wires. We compete with other global and local card
networks for commercial card portfolios. Additionally, we may face competition from ﬁnancial institution
clients who are experimenting with B2B blockchain payments.
Value Added Service Providers: We face competition from companies that provide alternatives
to our value added services. This includes a wide range of players, such as technology companies,
information services and consulting ﬁrms, governments and merchant services companies. The
integration of technology like generative AI can create new and better oﬀerings that compete with our
value added services, such as strengthened risk monitorization and managing digital identiﬁcation.
Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in these areas.
We believe our fundamental value proposition of security, convenience, speed and reliability as well
as the number of credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed. In addition, we
understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local ﬁnancial
institutions, merchants, ﬁntechs, governments, NGOs and business organizations to provide tailored and
innovative solutions. We will continue to utilize our network of networks strategy to facilitate the
movement of money. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively due to our global brand, our broad
set of payment products, new ﬂows oﬀerings and value added services, and our proven track record of
processing payment transactions securely and reliably.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global
regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most signiﬁcant
government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how
global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A—Regulatory Risks.
Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions: We are subject to
anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK
Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or oﬀering of improper payments to
foreign government oﬃcials and political ﬁgures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to
gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist
ﬁnancing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to
economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in
the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit ﬁnancial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries
or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria,
Crimea, and the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine), or that
are included on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire
Visa cards or engage in transactions using our products and services.
Government-Imposed Market Participation Restrictions: Certain governments, including
China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, have taken actions to promote domestic payments
systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks or processors, by imposing regulations that favor
domestic providers, impose local ownership requirements on processors, require data localization or
mandate that domestic processing be done in that country.
Interchange Rates and Fees: An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or
inﬂuence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the U.S. Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act (Dodd-Frank Act) limits interchange reimbursement rates for
certain debit card transactions in the U.S.; the European Union (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in the
European Economic Area (EEA) (as discussed below); and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the
Central Bank of Brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange.
Internet Transactions: Many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system
participants to monitor, identify, ﬁlter, restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of
payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling, digital currencies, the purchase of cigarettes or
alcohol and other controversial transaction types.
15
Table of Contents
Network Exclusivity and Routing: In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusivity and
restrictions on merchant routing choice for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions
impose similar limitations, such as the IFR’s prohibition in Europe on restrictions that prevent multiple
payment brands or functionality on the same card.
No-surcharge Rules: We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging
higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. However, merchants’
ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be
impacted by litigation, regulation and legislation.
Privacy and Data Protection: Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy, data
use and data security regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products
and services and even impact our ability to oﬀer a product or service. In addition, regulators are
proposing new laws or regulations that could require Visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data-
handling practices, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies
handling personal data.
Supervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry: Visa is subject to ﬁnancial sector oversight
and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., for example, the
Federal Banking Agencies (FBA) (formerly known as the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council) has supervisory oversight over Visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a
technology service provider to U.S. ﬁnancial institutions. The federal banking agencies comprising the
FBA are the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. Visa also may be separately examined by the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a service provider to the banks that issue Visa-branded
consumer credit and debit card products. Central banks in other countries/regions, including Canada,
Europe, India, Ukraine and the UK (as discussed below), have recognized or designated Visa as a retail
payment system under various types of ﬁnancial stability regulations. Visa is also subject to oversight by
banking and ﬁnancial sector authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Brazil and Hong Kong.
European and United Kingdom Regulations and Supervisory Oversight: Visa in Europe
continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the EEA and the UK.
There are a number of EU regulations that impact our business. As discussed above, the IFR
regulates interchange rates within the EEA, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme
activities from processing activities for accounting, organization and decision-making purposes within
the EEA, and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing. National competent authorities in
the EEA are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the IFR in their markets. We are also subject to
regulations governing areas such as privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering,
anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other regulations in Europe, such as the second Payment Services Directive
(PSD2), require, among other things, that our ﬁnancial institution clients provide certain customer
account access rights to emerging non-ﬁnancial institution players. PSD2 also includes strong customer
authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on
Visa and impact consumer payment experiences. Visa Europe is also subject to supervisory oversight by
the European Central Bank and certain competent authorities in Europe.
In the UK, Visa Europe is designated as a Recognized Payment System, bringing it within the scope
of the Bank of England’s supervisory powers and subjecting it to various requirements, including on
issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the UK’s ﬁnancial
system. Visa Europe is also regulated by the UK’s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide-
ranging powers and authority to review our business practices, systems, rules and fees with respect to
promoting competition and innovation in the UK, and ensuring payment systems take care of, and
promote, the interests of service-users. Post-Brexit, the UK has adopted various European regulations,
including regulations that impact the payments ecosystem, such as the IFR and PSD2. The PSR is
responsible for monitoring Visa Europe’s compliance with the IFR as adopted in the UK.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability: Certain governments around the world are
adopting laws and regulations pertaining to corporate responsibility and sustainability performance,
transparency and reporting. Regulations may include mandated corporate reporting (e.g., Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive) or in individual areas, such as mandated reporting on climate-related
ﬁnancial disclosures.
Additional Regulatory Developments: Various regulatory agencies across the world also
continue to examine a wide variety of other issues, including mobile payment transactions, tokenization,
access rights for non-ﬁnancial institutions, money transfer services, identity theft, account management
guidelines, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could aﬀect our ﬁnancial institution clients and
our business. Furthermore, following the
16
Table of Contents
passage of PSD2 in Europe, several countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and
Mexico, are contemplating granting or have already granted various types of access rights to third-party
processors, including access to consumer account data maintained by our ﬁnancial institution clients.
These changes could have negative implications for our business depending on how the regulations are
framed and implemented.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
Regulatory Risks
We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and
ﬁnancial results.
As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that
govern our operations. See Item 1—Government Regulation for more information on the most signiﬁcant
areas of regulation that aﬀect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other
third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules
or change existing rules; aﬀect our existing contractual arrangements; increase our compliance costs;
and require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties, including
competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below, we may face diﬀering rules
and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing
and localization requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices,
privacy, data use or protection, licensing requirements, and associated product technology. As a result,
the Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may diﬀer from country to country or
by product oﬀering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and reduces our
revenue opportunities.
If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have diﬃculty rapidly
adjusting our product oﬀerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply
with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with
a wide array of regulations and laws, such as regulations regarding anti-money laundering, anti-
corruption, competition, money transfer services, privacy and sanctions, and we continually adjust our
compliance programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be
deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are
found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and
criminal penalties, litigation, investigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and
reputation. Furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could
negatively impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we
process, our revenues, our brands, our competitive positioning, our ability to use our intellectual
property to diﬀerentiate our products and services, the quality and types of products and services we
oﬀer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can
obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and ﬁnancial results.
Increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to
interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk
management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.
Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate various
aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1—Government Regulation for more information. In the U.S.
and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even
though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a
payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers
to the issuers; the reverse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees are
a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important
determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether
voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially aﬀect our overall payments volumes and revenues.
Interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be
subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a
number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules and practices. For example:
•Regulations adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve cap the maximum U.S. debit interchange
reimbursement rate received by large ﬁnancial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per
transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits
issuers’ and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and
prepaid area, which also impacts our business. In response to merchant requests, the Federal
Reserve has recently taken actions to revisit its regulations that implement these aspects of the
Dodd-Frank Act. For example, in October 2022, the Federal Reserve published a ﬁnal rule
eﬀectively requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaﬃliated networks are available for
routing card not present debit transactions by July 1, 2023. In October 2023, the Federal
18
Table of Contents
Reserve issued a proposal for comment which would further lower debit interchange rates, with a
mechanism for automatic adjustment every two years. Separately, there continues to be interest
in regulation of credit interchange fees and routing practices by members of Congress and state
legislators in the U.S. In June 2023, legislation was reintroduced in the U.S. House of
Representatives and Senate, which among other things, would require large issuing banks to oﬀer
a choice of at least two unaﬃliated networks over which electronic credit transactions may be
processed. Similar legislation was introduced in the previous Congress in 2022 but failed to
advance and become law. The current legislation has additional bipartisan support, and while the
ultimate outcome of the legislation remains unclear, its sponsors continue to strongly advocate
for its passage.
•In Europe, the EU’s IFR places an eﬀective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit
interchange fees for both domestic and cross-border transactions within the EEA (30 basis points
and 20 basis points, respectively). EU member states have the ability to further reduce these
interchange levels within their territories. The European Commission has announced its intention
to conduct another impact assessment of the IFR, which could result in even lower caps on
interchange rates and the expansion of regulation to other types of products, services and fees.
•Several countries in Latin America continue to explore regulatory measures against payments
networks and have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps, including Argentina, Brazil,
Chile and Costa Rica. In Asia Paciﬁc, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) completed its review of
the country’s payment system regulations and adopted a series of measures, which include lower
interchange rates for debit transactions. The RBA also continues to assess the potential merits of
mandating co-badging and merchant routing choice on dual network debit cards. In addition, the
New Zealand Parliament passed legislation capping domestic interchange rates for debit and
credit products. Finally, many governments, including but not limited to governments in India,
Costa Rica, and Turkey, are using regulation to further drive down MDR, which could negatively
aﬀect the economics of our transactions.
•While the focus of interchange and MDR regulation has primarily been on domestic rates
historically, there is increasing focus on cross-border rates in recent years. For example, in 2019,
we settled certain cross-border interchange rates with the European Commission. In 2020, Costa
Rica became the ﬁrst country to formally regulate cross-border interchange rates by direct
regulation. Cross-border MDR is also regulated in Costa Rica and Turkey. Finally, in June 2022, the
UK’s PSR initiated two market reviews: one focusing on post-Brexit increases in interchange rates
for transactions between the UK and Europe, and another focusing on increases in the UK in what
are referred to as scheme and processing fees.
•As referenced above, with increased lobbying by merchants and other industry participants, we
are also beginning to see regulatory interest in network fees in the UK, Europe and Chile. In
addition, industry participants in some countries like Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Dominican
Republic, Paraguay, Peru and South Africa have sought intervention from competition regulators
or ﬁled claims relating to certain network rules, including Visa’s restrictions on cross-border
acquiring. Other countries, like New Zealand, are adopting regulations that require us to seek
government pre-approval of our network rules, which could also impact the way we operate in
certain markets.
•Government regulations or pressure may also impact our rules and practices and require us to
allow other payments networks to support Visa products or services, to have the other network’s
functionality or brand marks on our products, or to share our intellectual property with other
networks. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products
and services, they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory inﬂuence. For instance,
new products and capabilities, including tokenization, push payments, and new ﬂows (e.g., Visa
B2B Connect) could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries
where the product or capability is oﬀered. Furthermore, certain of our businesses are regulated as
payment institutions or as money transmitters, subjecting us to various licensing, supervisory,
and other requirements. In addition, the EU’s requirement to separate scheme and processing
adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies.
Regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the
payments industry. Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may inﬂuence regulatory
approaches in another. The risks created by a new law, regulation or regulatory outcome in one
jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively aﬀect our business in another
jurisdiction or in other product oﬀerings. For example, our settlement with the European Commission on
cross-border interchange rates has drawn preliminary attention from some regulators in other parts of
the world. Similarly, new regulations involving one product oﬀering may prompt regulators to extend
19
Table of Contents
the regulations to other product oﬀerings. For example, credit payments could become subject to similar
regulation as debit payments (or vice versa). The RBA initially capped credit interchange, but
subsequently capped debit interchange as well.
When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and
acquirers may ﬁnd our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other
payments systems, such as our competitors’ closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to
both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new
or higher fees, or reducing certain beneﬁts to consumers, which make our products less appealing to
consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher MDR regardless of the Visa interchange
reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternative
payments systems or forms of payment. In addition, in an eﬀort to reduce the expense of their payment
programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us,
including reductions in the fees that we charge, which directly impacts our revenues.
In addition, we are also subject to central bank oversight in a growing number of countries,
including Brazil, India, the UK and within the EU. Some countries with existing oversight frameworks are
looking to further enhance their regulatory powers while regulators in other jurisdictions are considering
or adopting approaches based on these regulatory principles. This oversight could result in new
governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital, or credit risk
management requirements. We could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to
mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain suﬃcient levels of
capital and ﬁnancial resources locally, as well as localized risk management or governance. Increased
oversight could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments
system.
Finally, policymakers and regulatory bodies in the U.S., Europe, and other parts of the world are
exploring ways to reform existing competition laws to meet the needs of the digital economy, including
restricting large technology companies from engaging in mergers and acquisitions, requiring them to
interoperate with potential competitors, and prohibiting certain kinds of self-preferencing behaviors.
While the focus of these eﬀorts remains primarily on increasing regulation of large technology, e-
commerce and social media companies, they could also have implications for other types of companies
including payments networks, which could constrain our ability to eﬀectively manage our business or
potentially limit how we make our products and services available.
Government-imposed obligations and/or restrictions on international payments systems may
prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including signiﬁcant
markets such as China and India.
Governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payments providers, including card
networks, brands, and processors, from international competition by imposing market access barriers
and preferential domestic regulations. To varying degrees, these policies and regulations aﬀect the terms
of competition in the marketplace and impair the ability of international payments networks to compete.
Public authorities may also impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate
that domestic payments or data processing be performed entirely within that country, which could
prevent us from managing the end-to-end processing of certain transactions.
In China, UnionPay remains the predominant processor of domestic payment card transactions and
operates the predominant domestic acceptance mark. Although we ﬁled an application with the People’s
Bank of China (PBOC) in May 2020 to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, the timing
and the procedural steps for approval remain uncertain. There is no guarantee that the license to
operate a BCCI will be approved or, if we obtain such license, that we will be able to successfully
compete with domestic payments networks. Co-badging and co-residency regulations also pose
additional challenges in markets where Visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing.
Certain banks have issued dual-branded cards for which domestic transactions in China are processed by
UnionPay and transactions outside of China are processed by Visa or other international payments
networks. The PBOC is contemplating that dual-branded cards be phased out over time as new licenses
are issued to international companies to participate in China’s domestic payments market. Accordingly,
we have been working with Chinese issuers to issue Visa-only branded cards for international travel, and
later for domestic transactions should we obtain a BCCI license. However, notwithstanding such eﬀorts,
the phase out of dual-branded cards have decreased our payment volumes and impacted the revenue
we generate in China.
UnionPay has grown rapidly in China and is actively pursuing international expansion plans, which
could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule (which requires that
international
20
Table of Contents
transactions on Visa cards be routed over VisaNet). Furthermore, although regulatory barriers shield
UnionPay from competition in China, alternative payments providers such as Alipay and WeChat Pay
have rapidly expanded into ecommerce, oﬄine, and cross-border payments, which could make it diﬃcult
for us to compete even if our license is approved in China. NetsUnion Clearing Corp, a Chinese digital
transaction routing system, and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison
with international payments networks.
Regulatory initiatives in India, including a data localization mandate passed by the government that
suggest growing nationalistic priorities, has cost implications for us and could aﬀect our ability to
eﬀectively compete with domestic payments providers. Furthermore, any inability to meet the
requirements of the data localization mandate could impact our ability to do business in India. In Europe,
with the support of the European Central Bank, a group of European banks have announced their intent
to launch a pan-European payment system, the European Payments Initiative (EPI). While EPI
subsequently announced a focus on account-to-account instant payments across a range of use cases, it
is noteworthy that the purported motivation behind EPI is to reduce the risks of disintermediation of
European providers by international technology companies and continued reliance on international
payments networks for intra-Europe card transactions. Furthermore, regional groups of countries, such
as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and a number of countries in Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia), have
adopted or may consider, eﬀorts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions.
The African Development Bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in
its eﬀorts to expand ﬁnancial inclusion and strengthen regional ﬁnancial stability. Finally, some countries
such as South Africa are mandating on-shore processing of domestic transactions. Geopolitical events,
including sanctions, trade tensions or other types of activities have intensiﬁed any or all of these
activities, which could adversely aﬀect our business. For example, in the aftermath of U.S. and European
sanctions against Russia and the decision by U.S. payments networks, including Visa to suspend
operations in the country, some countries have expressed concerns about their reliance on U.S. ﬁnancial
services companies, including payments networks, and have taken steps to bolster the development of
domestic solutions. Separately, Russia has called for the BRICS countries (a ﬁve-country bloc made up of
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and which recently extended invitations to Argentina, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates), to lessen dependence on Western payments
systems by, among other things, integrating payments systems and cards across member countries.
Central banks in a number of countries, including those in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Brazil,
Europe and Mexico, are in the process of developing or expanding national RTP networks and instant
payment solutions with the goal of driving a greater number of domestic transactions onto these
systems. In July 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve launched its FedNow Service with core clearing and
settlement functionality, and expects to add more features and enhancements over time. Some
countries are also exploring cross-border connectivity of their respective RTP systems. Finally, an
increasing number of jurisdictions are exploring the concept of building central bank digital currencies
for retail payments. If successfully deployed, these national payment platforms and digital currencies
could have signiﬁcant implications for Visa’s domestic and cross-border payments, including potential
disintermediation.
Due to our inability to manage the end-to-end processing of transactions for cards in certain
countries (e.g., Thailand), we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third-party
service providers to ensure transactions involving our products are processed eﬀectively. Our ability to
do so may be adversely aﬀected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction
routing or on-shore processing. In general, national laws that protect or otherwise support domestic
providers or processing may increase our costs; decrease our payments volumes and impact the
revenue we generate in those countries; decrease the number of Visa products issued or processed;
impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services
supporting our brands; restrict our activities; limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products,
services and innovations; force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets; and
create new competitors, all of which could harm our business.
Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede
our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or ﬁnes against us.
Our business relies on the movement of data across national borders. Legal requirements relating to
the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data continue to
evolve, and we are subject to an increasing number of privacy and data protection requirements around
the world. For example, our ongoing eﬀorts to comply with complex U.S. state privacy and data
protection regulations, and emerging international privacy and data protection laws, may increase the
complexity of our compliance operations, entail substantial expenses, divert resources from other
initiatives and projects, and limit the services we are able to oﬀer.
21
Table of Contents
Additionally, privacy laws in other regions, such as China’s Personal Information Protection Law and
India’s Personal Data Protection Act, have extraterritorial application and include restrictions on
processing sensitive data, extensive notiﬁcation requirements, and substantial compliance and audit
obligations. The global proliferation of new privacy and data protection laws may lead to inconsistent
and conﬂicting requirements, which create an uncertain regulatory environment. Noncompliance could
also result in regulatory penalties and signiﬁcant legal liability. Enforcement actions and investigations
by regulatory authorities into companies related to data security incidents and privacy violations are
generally increasing. In Europe, data protection authorities continue to apply and enforce the General
Data Protection (GDPR), imposing record setting ﬁnes.
We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing the development, use, and
deployment of AI technologies. These laws and regulations are still evolving, and there is no single
global regulatory framework for AI. The market is still assessing how regulators may apply existing
consumer protection and other laws in the context of AI. There is thus uncertainty on what new laws will
look like and how existing laws will apply to our development, use, and deployment of AI. In the midst of
this uncertainty, we may face challenges due to the complexity and rapidly changing nature of AI
technology and applicable laws. Our use of AI and machine learning is subject to various risks at each
stage of use. In the context of AI development, risks relate to intellectual property considerations, the
use of personal information, and ﬂaws in algorithms or datasets used for training. In the context of use
and deployment, risks include ethical considerations regarding the outputs, and our ability to safely
deploy AI throughout the organization. Our development and implementation of governance frameworks
for our AI and machine learning systems may not be successful in mitigating all of these emerging risks.
We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws.
We exercise signiﬁcant judgment and make estimates in calculating our worldwide provision for
income taxes and other tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many
factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, the UK’s HM Revenue and Customs as well as tax authorities in other
jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax
authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax
liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash ﬂow and ﬁnancial position.
In addition, changes in existing laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, including unilateral actions of
foreign jurisdictions to introduce digital services taxes, or changes resulting from the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development’s Program of Work, related to the revision of proﬁt allocation
and nexus rules and design of a system to ensure multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax
to the countries where we earn revenue, may also materially aﬀect our eﬀective tax rate. A substantial
increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse eﬀect on our ﬁnancial results. See also
Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Litigation Risks
We may be adversely aﬀected by the outcome of litigation or investigations.
We are involved in numerous litigation matters, investigations, and proceedings asserted by civil
litigants, governments, and enforcement bodies investigating or alleging, among other things, violations
of competition and antitrust law, consumer protection law, privacy law and intellectual property law
(these are referred to as “actions” in this section). Details of the most signiﬁcant actions we face are
described more fully in Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item
8 of this report. These actions are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations. In
the event we are found liable or reach a settlement in any action, particularly in a large class action
lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiﬀ to treble damages in the U.S., or
we incur liability arising from a government investigation, we may be required to pay signiﬁcant awards,
settlements or ﬁnes. In addition, settlement terms, judgments, orders or pressures resulting from actions
may harm our business by inﬂuencing or requiring us to modify, among other things, the default
interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those
rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also inﬂuence
regulators, investigators, governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions, which may lead
to additional actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to
indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, even if Visa is not a defendant.
For certain actions like those that are U.S. covered litigation or VE territory covered litigation, as
described in Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to
our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report, we have certain ﬁnancial
protections pursuant to the respective
22
Table of Contents
retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are diﬀerent in the
protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of
the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements,
judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our ﬁnancial condition or cash ﬂows, or even cause
us to become insolvent.
Business Risks
We face intense competition in our industry.
The global payments space is intensely competitive. As technology evolves and consumer
expectations change, new competitors or methods of payment emerge, and existing clients and
competitors assume diﬀerent roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic payments,
virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other domestic and closed-loop payments
systems, digital wallets and alternative payments providers primarily focused on enabling payments
through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we
face increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment providers such as ﬁntechs, other
digital payments, technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online
activity in ecommerce, social media, and mobile channels, as well as governments in a number of
jurisdictions (e.g., Brazil and India) as discussed above, that are developing, supporting and/or operating
national schemes, RTP networks and other payment platforms.
Our competitors may acquire, develop, or make better use of substantially better technology, have
more widely adopted delivery channels, or have greater ﬁnancial resources. They may oﬀer more
eﬀective, innovative or a wider range of programs, products and services. They may use more eﬀective
advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition, and greater use, including
with respect to issuance and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or
more favorable pricing arrangements. Moreover, even if we successfully adapt to technological change
and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and oﬀering our own
services in these areas, such services may provide less favorable ﬁnancial terms for us than we currently
receive from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our ﬁnancial results and prospects.
Certain of our competitors operate with diﬀerent business models, have diﬀerent cost structures or
participate in diﬀerent market segments. Those business models may ultimately prove more successful
or more adaptable to regulatory, technological and other developments. In some cases, these
competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability
to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. Some of our competitors, including
American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology
companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternative payments systems like
Alipay and WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both
merchants and consumers. Government actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act, the IFR in
Europe, or RTP initiatives by governments such as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FedNow or the Central
Bank of Brazil’s Pix system may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive
advantages from these business models, and may create new competitors, including in some cases the
government itself. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR may require us to open up
access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the
infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors. In addition to the open banking
provisions under PSD2, eﬀorts to implement or facilitate open banking and open ﬁnance requirements
are underway across a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada and the U.S., which could
impose additional requirements on ﬁnancial institutions or others regarding access to and use of
ﬁnancial data. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies
and platforms, including mobile payments, alternative payment credentials, other ledger technologies or
payment forms, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use
our payments network for processing transactions. For example, merchants could process transactions
directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.
We expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example:
•We, along with our competitors, clients, network participants, and others are developing or
participating in alternative payments systems or products, such as mobile payment services,
ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, real-time and faster payment initiatives,
and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from or to consumer checking accounts,
that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing
or the value added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives
from The Clearing House, an association consisting of large ﬁnancial institutions that has
developed its own faster payments system; Early Warning Services, which
23
Table of Contents
operates Zelle, a bank-oﬀered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds
or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and
government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and cryptocurrency or
stablecoin-based payments initiatives.
•Many countries or regions are developing or promoting domestic networks, switches and RTP
systems (e.g., U.S., Brazil, India and Europe) and in some countries the government itself owns
and operates these RTP systems (e.g., Brazil). To the extent these governments mandate local
banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions,
prohibit international payments networks, like Visa, from participating on those systems, and/or
impose restrictions or prohibitions, on international payments networks from oﬀering payment
services on such transactions, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in
those countries. For example, in some regions (Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle
East), including through intergovernmental organizations such as the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and the GCC, some countries are looking into cross-border connectivity of such
domestic systems. Similarly, India has expressed interest in expanding its digital public
infrastructure, which includes its RTP system, UPI, outside the country and for cross-border
payments. Currently, international payment networks like Visa are unable to participate in UPI.
•Parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the
payments value chain.
•Parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients,
technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate or steer account holders and
other clients to alternative payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and
technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms.
•Participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into
other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new,
competing payment services.
•New or revised industry standards related to online checkout and web payments, cloud-based
payments, tokenization or other payments-related technologies set by individual countries,
regions or organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American
National Standards Institute, World Wide Web Consortium, European Card Standards Group, PCI
Co, Nexo and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or
otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.
As the competitive landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond
suﬃciently to emerging risks associated with new businesses, products, services and practices. We may
be asked to adjust our local rules and practices, develop or customize certain aspects of our payment
services, or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of Visa’s proprietary technology
and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation
concerning intellectual property. Our failure to compete eﬀectively in light of any such developments
could harm our business and prospects for future growth.
Our revenues and proﬁts are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be
costly to win, retain and develop.
Our ﬁnancial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or
develop their own competitive services. While we have certain contractual protections, our clients,
including some of our largest clients, generally have ﬂexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in
certain circumstances, our ﬁnancial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual
relationship on relatively short notice without paying signiﬁcant early termination fees. Because a
signiﬁcant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business
from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial
condition. For more information, please see Note 14—Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of
Business to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
In addition, we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our ﬁnancial institution
clients. In certain regions, we are increasingly facing competition from RTP networks and other payment
facilitators oﬀering lower pricing, as well as initiatives to lower costs, such as the G20 Roadmap for
Enhancing Cross-border Payments. In order to stay competitive, we may need to adjust our pricing or
oﬀer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments, adapt to
regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. These include
up-front cash payments, fee discounts, rebates, credits,
24
Table of Contents
performance-based incentives, marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and
proﬁtability. In addition, we oﬀer incentives to certain merchants and acquirers to win routing preference
in relation to other network options or forms of payment. Market pressures on pricing, incentives, fee
discounts and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and
productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to oﬀset or
absorb the ﬁnancial impact of these incentives, fee discounts and rebates, it may harm our net revenues
and proﬁts.
In addition, it may be diﬃcult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with ﬁnancial
institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our
competitors. These ﬁnancial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more
quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one
or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a ﬁnancial institution client or merchant with a
strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor,
which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business.
Merchants’ and processors’ continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge
industry practices could harm our business.
We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients or their agents to maintain and
expand the use and acceptance of Visa products. Certain merchants and merchant-aﬃliated groups have
been exerting their inﬂuence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such as the U.S.,
Canada and Europe, to attempt to lower acceptance costs paid by merchants to acquirers or their agents
to accept payment products or services, by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory intervention,
ﬁling lawsuits and in some cases, surcharging or refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful
in their eﬀorts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses, issuers may decrease their
issuance of our products, and consumer usage of our products could be adversely impacted. For
example, in the U.S., certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security
standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and the cost of payment card acceptance. In
addition to ongoing litigation related to the U.S. migration to EMV-capable cards and point-of-sale
terminals, U.S. merchant-aﬃliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the EMV
certiﬁcation process and some policymakers have expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies
such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in the development of
payment card standards. Additionally, many merchants have advocated for lower acceptance costs in
the form of reduced interchange rates, which could result in some issuers eliminating or reducing their
promotion or use of Visa’s products and services, eliminating or reducing cardholder beneﬁts such as
rewards programs, or charging account holders increased or new fees for using Visa-branded products,
all of which could negatively impact Visa’s transaction volumes and related revenues. Finally, some
merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and Visa acceptance
requirements at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa
products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transactions, to diﬀerentiate or steer among Visa product
types issued by diﬀerent ﬁnancial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa
products as their form of payment. If successful, these eﬀorts could adversely impact consumers’ usage
of our products and decrease our overall transaction volumes and fee revenues, lead to regulatory
enforcement and/or litigation that increases our compliance and litigation expenses, and ultimately harm
our business.
We depend on relationships with ﬁnancial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants,
payment facilitators, ecommerce platforms, ﬁntechs and other third parties.
As noted above, our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance
the interests of multiple third parties. For instance, we depend signiﬁcantly on relationships with our
ﬁnancial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our
programs and services, and thereby compete eﬀectively in the marketplace. We provide incentives to
merchants, acquirers, ecommerce platforms and processors to promote routing preference and
acceptance growth. We also engage in many payment card co-branding eﬀorts with merchants, who
receive incentives from us. As emerging participants such as ﬁntechs enter the payments industry, we
engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem, whether as, for example, an
issuer, merchant, ecommerce platform or digital wallet provider. As these and other relationships
become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly
depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In addition, we depend on our clients and
third parties, including network partners, vendors and suppliers, to submit, facilitate and process
transactions properly, provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and
otherwise adhere to our operating rules and applicable laws. To the extent that such parties fail to
perform or deliver adequate services, it may result in negative
25
Table of Contents
experiences for account holders or others when using their Visa-branded payment products, which could
harm our business and reputation.
Our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if
events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience
brand disintermediation.
Our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business. We believe that our clients and
their account holders associate our brand with acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our
products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products,
services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The popularity of products that we have
developed in partnership with technology companies and ﬁnancial institutions as well as government
actions that mandate other networks to process Visa-branded card transactions may have the potential
to cause brand disintermediation at the point of sale, in ecommerce and mobile channels, and decrease
the presence of our brand. Our brand reputation may also be negatively impacted by a number of
factors, including authorization, clearing and settlement service disruptions; data security breaches;
compliance failures by Visa, including by our employees, agents, clients, partners or suppliers; failure to
meet expectations of our clients, consumers, or other stakeholders; negative perception of our industry,
the industries of our clients, Visa-accepting merchants, or our clients’ customers and agents, including
third-party payments providers; ill-perceived actions or aﬃliations by clients, partners or other third
parties, such as sponsorship or co-brand partners; and fraudulent, or illegal activities using our payment
products or services, and which we may not always be in a position to detect and/or prevent from
occurring over our network. Our brand could also be negatively impacted when our products are used to
facilitate payment for legal, but controversial, products and services, including, but not limited to, adult
content, cryptocurrencies, ﬁrearms and gambling activities. Additionally, these risks could be
exacerbated if our ﬁnancial institution partners and/or merchants fail to maintain necessary controls to
ensure the legality of these transactions, if any legal liability associated with such goods or services is
extended to ancillary participants in the value chain like payments networks, or if our network and
industry become entangled in political or social debates concerning such legal, but controversial,
commerce. If we are unable to maintain our reputation, the value of our brand may be impaired, which
could harm our relationships with clients, account holders, employees, prospective employees,
governments and the public, as well as impact our business.
Global economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions may harm our
business.
More than half of our net revenues are earned outside the U.S. International cross-border
transaction revenues represent a signiﬁcant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth
strategy. Our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by
consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be aﬀected by economic,
political, market, health and social events or conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions within the
U.S. or internationally, including but not limited to recessions, inﬂation, rising interest rates, high
unemployment, currency ﬂuctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, rising energy
prices, or a slowdown of global trade, and reduced consumer, small business, government, and
corporate spending, have a direct impact on our volumes, transactions and revenues. Furthermore, in
eﬀorts to deal with adverse macroeconomic conditions, governments may introduce new or additional
initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payment fees or other costs. In an overall soft global
economy, such pricing measures could result in additional ﬁnancial pressures on our business.
In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics like COVID-19, or other local or global health issues,
political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conﬂicts, wars, civil unrest, climate-related events,
including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, impacts to the power grid, and natural
disasters have to varying degrees negatively impacted our operations, clients, third-party suppliers,
activities, and cross-border travel and spend. Although the World Health Organization and the federal
government declared an end to COVID-19 as a global and national health emergency, respectively, risks
related to COVID-19 have adversely aﬀected and may continue to adversely aﬀect our business, results
of operations, cash ﬂows and ﬁnancial condition. The ongoing eﬀects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain
diﬃcult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the resumption of international travel, and
the indirect impact of the pandemic on global economic activity. In addition, a number of countries took
steps during the pandemic to temporarily cap interchange or other fees on electronic payments as part
of their COVID-19 economic relief measures. While most have been rescinded or have expired, it
26
Table of Contents
is possible that proponents of interchange and/or MDR regulation may try to position government
intervention as necessary to support potential future economic relief initiatives.
Geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as
continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions, tariﬀs or trade restrictions also limit the
expansion of our business in certain regions and have resulted in us suspending our operations in other
regions. During ﬁscal 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union,
United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. In March 2022, we
suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and
cross-border activities related to Russia. For ﬁscal 2022 and 2021, total net revenues from Russia,
including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were approximately 2% and 4%
of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. The war in Ukraine and any further actions by, or in
response to such actions by, Russia or its allies could have lasting impacts on Ukraine as well as other
regional and global economies, any or all of which could adversely aﬀect our business.
A decline in economic, political, market, health and social conditions could impact our clients as
well, and their decisions could reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account
holders, and impact overall consumption by consumers and businesses, which would ultimately impact
our revenues. Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing
budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us. Any events or
conditions that impair the functioning of the ﬁnancial markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a
downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to
access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could aﬀect our liquidity and capital
resources, or signiﬁcantly increase our cost of capital.
Finally, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate
actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments
are implementing regulations and investors and other stakeholders are imposing new expectations or
focusing investments in ways that may cause signiﬁcant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption
behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business. As a result of any of these factors, any
decline in cross-border travel and spend would impact our cross-border volumes, the number of cross-
border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities, which in turn would reduce our
international transaction revenues.
Our aspirations to address corporate responsibility and sustainability (CRS) matters and
considerations could adversely aﬀect our business and ﬁnancial results or negatively impact
our reputation.
We are subject to laws, regulations and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including
those that are related to matters beyond our core products and services, such as matters that touch
upon sustainability, climate change, human capital, inclusion and diversity, and human rights. A wide
range of stakeholders, including governments, customers, employees, and investors are increasingly
focused on and are developing expectations regarding these corporate responsibility matters. We have
established CRS-related initiatives, adopted reporting frameworks, and announced several related goals.
These goals may change from time to time, implementation of these goals may require considerable
investments, and ultimately, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them.
Our ability to achieve any CRS objectives is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of
our control, including the evolving legal environment and regulatory requirements for the tracking and
reporting of CRS standards or disclosures and the actions of suppliers, partners, and other third parties.
Certain of our regulators have proposed or adopted, or may propose or adopt, rules or standards related
to these matters that would apply to our business. Prevailing CRS standards and expectations may also
reﬂect conﬂicting values or objectives, which can result in our practices being judged by standards that
are continually evolving and are not always clear. From time to time, the methodologies for reporting our
CRS data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reﬂect an improvement in
the availability and quality of data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our
operations, and other changes in circumstances. This may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful
comparative data from period to period or between us and other companies in the same industry.
Further, where new laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements,
we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations.
Our stakeholders often hold diﬀering views on our CRS-related goals and initiatives, which may result
in negative attention in traditional and social media or a negative perception of our response to concerns
regarding these matters. In addition, we also face potentially conﬂicting supervisory directives as certain
U.S. regulatory and non-U.S. authorities have prioritized CRS-related issues while Congress and certain
U.S. state governments have signaled pursuing potentially conﬂicting priorities. These circumstances,
among others, may result in pressure from
27
Table of Contents
investors, unfavorable reputational impacts, including inaccurate perceptions or a misrepresentation of
our actual CRS practices, diversion of management's attention and resources, and proxy ﬁghts, among
other material adverse impacts on our businesses. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to
our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of CRS laws and regulations, or meet
evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our business,
reputation, ﬁnancial condition, and operating results.
Our indemniﬁcation obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to
signiﬁcant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity.
We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suﬀer due to the failure of
another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating
rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is
not processed by our system. This indemniﬁcation creates settlement risk for us due to the timing
diﬀerence between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our
indemniﬁcation exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa card payment transactions
at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for
previously processed transactions. Changes in the credit standing of our clients or concurrent settlement
failures or insolvencies involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients,
signiﬁcant sponsor banks through which non-ﬁnancial institutions participate in the Visa network, or
systemic operational failures could expose us to liquidity risk, and negatively impact our ﬁnancial
position. Even if we have suﬃcient liquidity to cover a settlement failure or insolvency, we may be
unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to signiﬁcant losses and harm our
business. See Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements
included in Item 8 of this report.
Technology and Cybersecurity Risks
Failure to anticipate, adapt to, or keep pace with, new technologies in the payments industry
could harm our business and impact future growth.
The global payments industry is undergoing signiﬁcant and rapid technological change, including
increased proliferation of mobile and other proximity and in-app payment technologies, ecommerce,
tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, cloud-based encryption
and authorization, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, FIDO 2.0, 3D Secure 2.0 and
dynamic cardholder veriﬁcation values or dCVV2. As a result, we expect new services and technologies
to continue to emerge and evolve, including those developed by Visa such as our new ﬂows oﬀerings.
For example, in the past year generative AI solutions have emerged as an opportunity for Visa, its
clients, suppliers, merchants, and partners to innovate more quickly and better serve consumers. Rapid
adoption and novel uses of generative AI across the marketplace may also introduce unique and
unpredictable security risks to our systems, information, and the payments ecosystem. In addition to our
own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, for
the development of, and access to, new technologies. It is diﬃcult, however, to predict which
technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may
be regulated. Moreover, some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual property-related
lawsuits or claims, potentially impacting our development eﬀorts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses,
implement design changes or discontinue our use. If we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with
new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete,
decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or
licensing rights, harm our business and impact our future growth.
A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-
attacks, could harm our business.
Our cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of ﬁnancial institutions, merchants and
third-party service providers, have experienced and may continue to experience errors, interruptions,
delays or damage from a number of causes, including power outages, hardware, software and network
failures, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or other destructive software, internal design, manual
or user errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural
disasters, severe weather conditions and other eﬀects from climate change. In addition, there is risk that
third party suppliers of hardware and infrastructure required to operate our data centers and support
employee productivity could be impacted by supply chain disruptions, such as manufacturing, shipping
delays, and service disruption due to cyber-attacks. An extended supply chain or service disruption could
also impact processing or delivery of technology services.
28
Table of Contents
Furthermore, our visibility and role in the global payments industry also puts our company at a
greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target
of malicious cyber-attack attempts. We have been, and may continue to be, impacted by attacks and
data security breaches of ﬁnancial institutions, merchants, and third-party service providers. We are also
aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our ﬁnancial institution
clients, and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security
breaches aﬀecting their customers, some of whom were Visa account holders. Given the increase in
online banking, ecommerce and other online activity, as well as more employees working remotely as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see increased cyber and payment fraud activity, as
cybercriminals attempt DDoS related attacks, phishing and social engineering scams and other
disruptive actions. Overall, such attacks and breaches have resulted, and may continue to result in,
fraudulent activity and ultimately, ﬁnancial losses to Visa’s clients.
Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks,
targeted attacks against our employees and trusted partners (i.e., insider threats), synthetic media
threats such as phishing, deepfake or social engineering schemes, particularly on our internet-facing
applications, could compromise the conﬁdentiality, availability and integrity of data in our systems or the
systems of our third-party service providers. Because the tactics, techniques and procedures used to
obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become
increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be diﬃcult to detect for periods of time, we may
not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. For example, cybercriminals have increasingly
demonstrated advanced capabilities, such as use of zero-day vulnerabilities, and rapid integration of
new technology such as generative AI. The security measures and procedures we, our ﬁnancial
institution and merchant clients, other merchants and third-party service providers in the payments
ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be
successful or suﬃcient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures. In some
cases, the mitigation eﬀorts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required
contractual standards, who may not be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or ﬁx security defects, or
whose hardware, software or network services may be subject to error, defect, delay, outage or lack
appropriate malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exﬁltration incidents. Despite our security
measures and programs to protect our systems and data, and prevent, detect and respond to data
security incidents, there can be no assurance that our eﬀorts will prevent these threats.
In addition, as a global ﬁnancial services company, Visa is increasingly subject to complex and
varied cybersecurity regulations and cyber incident reporting requirements across numerous
jurisdictions. With the often short timeframes required for cyber incident reporting, there is a risk that
Visa or its suppliers will fail to meet the reporting deadlines for any given incident. In the event we are
found to be out of compliance, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties,
litigation, investigations and proceedings, and damage to our reputation and brand.
Any of these events could signiﬁcantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers;
damage our reputation and brand; result in litigation or claims, violations of applicable privacy and other
laws, and increased regulatory review or scrutiny, investigations, actions, ﬁnes or penalties; result in
damages or changes to our business practices; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products;
decrease our volume, revenues and future growth prospects; and be costly, time consuming and diﬃcult
to remedy. In the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not
be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data through
our business continuity program. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance, our coverage may not
suﬃciently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.
Structural and Organizational Risks
We may not achieve the anticipated beneﬁts of our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic
investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result.
As part of our overall business strategy, we make acquisitions and strategic investments, and enter
into joint ventures. We may not achieve the anticipated beneﬁts of our current and future acquisitions,
joint ventures or strategic investments and they may involve signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties,
including:
•disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and management’s attention
from our existing business;
29
Table of Contents
•greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses;
•failure to adequately develop or integrate our acquired entities or joint ventures;
•the data security, cybersecurity and operational resilience posture of our acquired entities, joint
ventures or companies we invest in or partner with, may not be adequate and may be more
susceptible to cyber incidents;
•diﬃculty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures and policies at our acquired
entities or joint ventures;
•challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technologies;
•failure to retain employees, clients or partners of our acquired entities or joint ventures;
•in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across diﬀerent
cultures and languages;
•disruptions, costs, liabilities, judgments, settlements or business pressures resulting from
litigation matters, investigations or legal proceedings involving our acquisitions, joint ventures or
strategic investments;
•the inability to pursue aspects of our acquisitions or joint ventures due to outcomes in litigation
matters, investigations or legal proceedings;
•failure to obtain the necessary government or other approvals at all, on a timely basis or without
the imposition of burdensome conditions or restrictions;
•the economic, political, regulatory and compliance risks associated with our acquisitions, joint
ventures or strategic investments, including when entering into a new business or operating in
new regions or countries. For more information on regulatory risks, please see Item 1—
Government Regulations and Item 1A—Regulatory Risks above;
•discovery of unidentiﬁed issues and related liabilities after our acquisitions, joint ventures or
investments were made;
•failure to mitigate the deﬁciencies and liabilities of our acquired entities or joint ventures;
•dilutive issuance of equity securities, if new securities are issued;
•the incurrence of debt;
•negative impact on our ﬁnancial position and/or statement of operations; and
•anticipated beneﬁts, synergies or value of our acquisitions, joint ventures or investments not
materializing or taking longer than expected to materialize.
In addition, we may pursue additional strategic objectives, such as the potential exchange oﬀer
program, which can divert resources and management’s attention from our existing business and, if
unsuccessful, may harm our business and reputation.
We may be unable to attract, hire and retain a highly qualiﬁed and diverse workforce,
including key management.
The talents and eﬀorts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success.
The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry, especially in ﬁntech, technology,
cybersecurity and other specialized areas, is extremely competitive. Our management team has
signiﬁcant industry experience and would be diﬃcult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to
attract, hire or retain other highly qualiﬁed employees, particularly if we do not oﬀer employment terms
that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding
immigration, travel and work authorizations have made it more diﬃcult for employees to work in, or
transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could continue to impair our ability to
attract, hire and retain qualiﬁed employees. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly
qualiﬁed and diverse employee talent, especially in light of changing worker expectations and talent
marketplace variability regarding ﬂexible work models; to meet our goals related to fostering an
inclusive and
30
Table of Contents
diverse culture or to adequately address potential increased scrutiny of our inclusion and diversity-
related programs and initiatives; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the
management team; to maintain our strong corporate culture of fostering innovation, collaboration and
inclusion in our current hybrid model; or to design and successfully implement ﬂexible work models that
meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could impact our workforce
development goals, impact our ability to achieve our business objectives, and adversely aﬀect our
business and our future success.
The conversions of our class B and class C common stock or series A, B and C preferred stock
into shares of class A common stock would result in voting dilution to, and could adversely
impact the market price of, our existing class A common stock.
The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. The value of our
class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock is tied to the value of the class A
common stock. Under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, upon ﬁnal resolution of our U.S. covered
litigation, all class B common stock will become convertible into class A common stock. Under our
Europe retrospective responsibility plan, Visa will continue to release value from the series B and series
C preferred stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation. The series B and
series C preferred stock will become fully convertible to series A preferred stock or class A common stock
no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims). Conversion of our class B and
class C common stock into class A common stock, or our series A, B and C preferred stock into class A
common stock, would increase the amount of class A common stock outstanding, which would dilute the
voting power of existing class A common stockholders. In addition, the sale of signiﬁcant portions of
converted class A common stock could adversely impact the market price of our existing class A
common stock.
Holders of our class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock may have
diﬀerent interests than our class A common stockholders concerning certain signiﬁcant
transactions.
Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock and, in certain
speciﬁed circumstances, holders of our series A, B and C preferred stock, can vote on certain signiﬁcant
transactions. With respect to our class B and C common stock, these transactions include a proposed
consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required
under Delaware law, such as the proposed certiﬁcate of incorporation amendments. Please see Item 7 of
this report for more information regarding the potential exchange oﬀer program. With respect to our
series A, B and C preferred stock, voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in
which holders of the series A, B and C preferred stock would receive shares of stock or other equity
securities with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences,
rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock; or, in the case of series B and C
preferred stock, holders would receive securities, cash or other property that is diﬀerent from what our
class A common stockholders would receive. Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than
class A common stock are our current and former ﬁnancial institution clients, they may have interests
that diverge from our class A common stockholders. As a result, the holders of these classes of capital
stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the
holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conﬂict with interests of our class A
common stockholders.
Delaware law, provisions in our certiﬁcate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital
structure could make a merger, takeover attempt or change in control diﬃcult.
Provisions contained in our certiﬁcate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could
delay or prevent a merger, takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider
favorable. For example, except for limited exceptions:
•no person may beneﬁcially own more than 15 percent of our class A common stock (or 15
percent of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of
directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance;
•no competitor or an aﬃliate of a competitor may hold more than 5 percent of our total
outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis;
•the aﬃrmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock
are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers;
•our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders’ meeting and may not act by written
consent; and
31
Table of Contents
•only our board of directors, Chairperson, or CEO or any stockholders who have owned
continuously for at least one year not less than 15 percent of the voting power of all shares of
class A common stock outstanding may call a special meeting of stockholders.

ITEM 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities
Our class A common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “V”.
As of November 8, 2023, we had 316 stockholders of record of our class A common stock. The number of
beneﬁcial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of
our class A common stock is held in “street name” by brokers and other ﬁnancial institutions on behalf of
our stockholders. There is currently no established public trading market for our class B or C common
stock. As of November 8, 2023, there were 1,106 and 381 holders of record of our class B and C common
stock, respectively.
On October 24, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share of
class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C
convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 1, 2023, to
holders of record as of November 9, 2023.
Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our
outstanding common and preferred stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future
dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors,
including our ﬁnancial condition, settlement indemniﬁcations, operating results, available cash and
current and anticipated cash needs.

ITEM 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, ﬁnancial
condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, us, our or the
Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have aﬀected recent earnings, as well as
those factors that may aﬀect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this
report.
This section of the report generally discusses ﬁscal 2023 compared to ﬁscal 2022. Discussions of
ﬁscal 2022 compared to 2021 that are not included in this report can be found in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, ﬁled with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission.
Overview
Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money
movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants,
ﬁnancial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. We provide transaction
processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our ﬁnancial institution and
merchant clients through VisaNet, our proprietary advanced transaction processing network. We oﬀer
products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable, and eﬃcient money movement for all
participants in the ecosystem.
Financial overview. A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as
follows:

Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded
numbers.
For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP ﬁnancial results, see tables in Non-GAAP ﬁnancial results below.
Disruption in the Banking Sector. During ﬁscal 2023, certain U.S. banks failed, which caused
volatility in the global ﬁnancial markets. These events did not have an impact on our operating results.
We continuously monitor and manage balance sheet and operational risks from clients in our portfolio,
including their settlement obligations.
Russia & Ukraine. During ﬁscal 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S.,
European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients.
In March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue
from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For ﬁscal 2022 and 2021, total net revenues
from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were
approximately 2% and 4% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively.
The continuing eﬀects of the liquidity issues at certain ﬁnancial institutions and the war in Ukraine
are diﬃcult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identiﬁed in Part I, Item 1A of this report. We will
continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.
Highlights for ﬁscal 2023. Net revenues increased 11% over the prior year, primarily due to the
year-over-year growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments(1)

Table of Contents
higher client incentives. Exchange rate movements lowered our net revenues growth by approximately
one-and-a-half percentage points.
GAAP operating expenses increased 11% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher expenses
related to personnel. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. Non-
GAAP operating expenses increased 12% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher expenses
related to personnel.
Pending acquisition. In June 2023, we entered into a deﬁnitive agreement to acquire Pismo Holdings
(Pismo), a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America,
Asia Paciﬁc and Europe, for $1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing
conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals.
Interchange multidistrict litigation. During ﬁscal 2023, we recorded additional accruals of $906
million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits
of $1.0 billion into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective
Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in
Item 8 of this report.
Potential exchange oﬀer program. In September 2023, we announced that we are engaging with our
common stockholders on the subject of potential amendments to our certiﬁcate of incorporation that
would authorize Visa to conduct an exchange oﬀer program that would have the eﬀect of releasing
transfer restrictions on portions of our class B common stock prior to the ﬁnal resolution of the U.S.
covered litigation. See our current report on Form 8-K ﬁled with the SEC on September 13, 2023.
Common stock repurchases. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share
repurchase program. During ﬁscal 2023, we repurchased 55 million shares of our class A common stock
in the open market for $12.2 billion. As of September 30, 2023, our share repurchase program had
remaining authorized funds of $5.0 billion. In October 2023, our board of directors authorized a new
$25.0 billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year ﬂexibility. See Note 15—Stockholders’
Equity to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Non-GAAP ﬁnancial results. We use non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures of our performance which exclude
certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-
recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-
GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view
and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.
•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic
non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-
term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains
and losses associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that
we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.
•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of
amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and
brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in ﬁscal 2019.
Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As
such, we have excluded this amount to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating
performance and comparison to our past operating performance.
•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and
integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional
fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the
purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and
deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the
transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded
these amounts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reﬂect the
underlying performance of our business.
36
Table of Contents
•Litigation provision. We recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the
interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover
the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to
the rate at which shares of our class B common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A
common stock. For ﬁscal 2023 and 2022, basic earnings per class A common stock was
unchanged and increased $0.01, respectively, as a result of the downward adjustments of the
class B common stock conversion rate during the ﬁscal years. For ﬁscal 2023 and 2022, diluted
earnings per class A common stock remained unchanged. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe
Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated ﬁnancial
statements included in Item 8 of this report.
•Russia-Ukraine charges. We recorded a loss within general and administrative expense from the
deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary and also incurred charges in personnel expense as a
result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these
amounts as they are one-time charges and do not reﬂect the underlying performance of our
business.
•Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. In connection with the UK enacted legislation on June
10, 2021 that increased the tax rate from 19% to 25%, eﬀective April 1, 2023, we remeasured

expense.
•Indirect taxes. We recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense to
record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we
could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not
representative of our ongoing operations.

Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our
service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data
processing revenues.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other
form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged
volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by
applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our
volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors
carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.(1) (2) (2)

Service revenues in a given quarter are primarily assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore,
service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were based on nominal payments
volume reported by our ﬁnancial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On
occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.

Results of Operations
Net Revenues
Our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased
goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. See Note 1—
Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of
this report for further discussion on the components of our net revenues.

Net revenues increased in ﬁscal 2023 primarily due to the year-over-year growth in nominal cross-
border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially oﬀset by higher client
incentives.
Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as
payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. In
ﬁscal 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenues growth by approximately one-and-a-
half percentage points.

•Data processing revenues increased primarily due to 10% growth in processed transactions,
select pricing modiﬁcations and growth in value added services. Data processing revenues
increased over the prior-year comparable ﬁscal year despite the impact of our suspension of
operations in Russia.
•International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border
volumes of 23%, excluding transactions within Europe, and select pricing modiﬁcations, partially
oﬀset by business mix and lower volatility of a broad range of currencies.
•Other revenues increased primarily due to growth in marketing and consulting services and
select pricing modiﬁcations.
•Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume during ﬁscal 2023. The
amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in
performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the
execution of new contracts.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of the following:
•Personnel expenses include salaries, employee beneﬁts, incentive compensation, share-based
compensation and contractor expenses.
•Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns,
sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand and client marketing.
•Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing
network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services.
•Professional fees mainly consist of fees for legal, consulting and other professional services.
•Depreciation and amortization expenses include amortization of internally developed and
purchased software, depreciation expense for property and equipment and amortization of ﬁnite-
lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions.
•General and administrative expenses consist mainly of card beneﬁts such as costs associated
with airport lounge access, extended cardholder protection and concierge services, facilities
costs, travel and meeting costs, indirect taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses and other
corporate expenses incurred in support of our business.

Operating expenses include signiﬁcant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. See Overview
within this Item 7.
•Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher number of employees and compensation,
reﬂecting our strategy to invest in future growth, including acquisitions.
•Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and
amortization from our on-going investments and acquisitions.
•General and administrative expenses increased due to unfavorable foreign currency ﬂuctuations,
higher usage of travel related card beneﬁts and travel expenses, partially oﬀset by the absence
of expenses as a result of the suspension of our operations in Russia.
•Litigation provision increased primarily due to higher accruals related to the U.S. covered
litigation. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal
Matters included in Item 8 of this report.
Non-operating Income (Expense)
Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense related to borrowings, gains
and losses on investments and derivative instruments, interest expense from tax liabilities, as well as
the non-service components of net periodic pension income and expense.

The eﬀective income tax rates in ﬁscal 2023 and ﬁscal 2022 were 18% including the following:
•during ﬁscal 2023, a $142 million tax beneﬁt related to prior years due to the reassessment of an
uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination;
and
•during ﬁscal 2022, a $176 million tax beneﬁt related to prior years due to a decrease in the state
apportionment ratio as a result of a tax position taken related to a ruling.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Based on our current cash ﬂow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity
needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be suﬃcient to meet our
projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity
position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current
economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.
Cash Flow Data
The following table summarizes our cash ﬂow activity:

Investing activities $ (2,006)$ (4,288)$ (152)
Financing activities $(17,772)$ (12,696)$ (14,410)
Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in ﬁscal 2023 was higher than the prior
ﬁscal year primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially oﬀset by higher incentive
payments.
Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities in ﬁscal 2023 was lower than the prior ﬁscal
year primarily due to the absence of cash paid for acquisitions, cash received from the settlement of net
investment hedge derivative instruments in the current year and lower purchases of investment
securities, partially oﬀset by lower sales and maturities of investment securities.
Financing activities. Cash used in ﬁnancing activities in ﬁscal 2023 was higher than the prior ﬁscal
year primarily due to the absence of proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, higher principal debt
payment upon maturity of our senior notes, higher dividends paid and higher share repurchases.
Sources of Liquidity
Cash, cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents
balance were $16.3 billion and our available-for-sale debt securities were $5.4 billion. Our investment
portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and
liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and U.S.
government-sponsored agencies. $3.5 billion of the investments are classiﬁed as current and are
available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-
43
Table of Contents
current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date;
however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.
Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to,
changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by
central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We
will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if
current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we
could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our ﬁnancial
results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one ﬁnancial institution or type
of investment.
Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working
capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2023, we had no
outstanding obligations under the program. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements
included in Item 8 of this report.
Credit facility. We have an unsecured $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2028.
As of September 30, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. See Note 10—
Debt to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan,
which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from ﬁnancial liability for
certain litigation cases, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from
settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. As these funds are restricted
for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, we do not rely on
them for other operational needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and
Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Uses of Liquidity
Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our ﬁnancial institution clients can
represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the
same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with
industry practice for such transactions. In general, during ﬁscal 2023, we were not required to fund
settlement-related working capital. As of September 30, 2023, we held $10.1 billion of our total available
liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our ﬁnancial institution clients are unable to
settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. See
Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item
8 of this report.
Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation or other ﬁnes imposed in investigations and
proceedings could give rise to future liquidity needs. During ﬁscal 2023, we deposited $1.0 billion into
the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict
litigation. The balance of this account as of September 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion and is reﬂected as
restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective
Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in
Item 8 of this report.
Common stock repurchases. During ﬁscal 2023, we repurchased shares of our class A common
stock in the open market for $12.2 billion. As of September 30, 2023, our share repurchase program had
remaining authorized funds of $5.0 billion. In October 2023, our board of directors authorized a new
$25.0 billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year ﬂexibility. Share repurchases will be
executed at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and our
ﬁnancial performance, and may be eﬀected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open
market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. See Note 15
—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Dividends. During ﬁscal 2023, we declared and paid $3.8 billion in dividends to holders of our
common and preferred stock. On October 24, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $0.52 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common
stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We
expect to pay approximately $1.1 billion in connection with this dividend on December 1, 2023. We
expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to
44
Table of Contents
approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an
as-converted basis in such future dividends.
Senior notes. As of September 30, 2023, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating
to our senior notes of $20.9 billion. During ﬁscal 2023, we repaid $2.25 billion of principal upon maturity
of our December 2022 senior notes. Since the issuance of the $500 million green bond as part of our
commitment to environmental sustainability and a sustainable payments ecosystem, we have allocated
$391 million to eligible green projects. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements
included in Item 8 of this report.
Client incentives. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term liabilities recorded on
the consolidated balance sheet related to these agreements of $8.2 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.
Uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2023, we had long-term liabilities for uncertain tax
positions of $1.6 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in
Item 8 of this report.
Pending acquisition. In June 2023, we entered into a deﬁnitive agreement to acquire Pismo for
$1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable
regulatory reviews and approvals.
Purchase obligations. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term obligations of
$1.7 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, related to agreements to purchase goods and services that
specify signiﬁcant terms, including ﬁxed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable
price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual
years of spend are not speciﬁed in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts
will be spent. For future obligations related to software licenses, see Note 18—Commitments to our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Leases. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $12 million and
$421 million, respectively, related to leases that have not yet commenced. For future lease payments
related to leases that have commenced and are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, see Note
9—Leases to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term obligations of
$162 million and $431 million, respectively, related to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax
credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries recognized during ﬁscal 2018.
Indemniﬁcations
We indemnify our ﬁnancial institution clients for settlement losses suﬀered due to the failure of any
other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the
indemniﬁcation is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We
maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk,
which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—
Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates, which we have
either determined to be not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions
and estimates that aﬀect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We have established policies
and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately
governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could diﬀer from our
assumptions and estimates, and such diﬀerences could be material.
We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and
evaluate our reported ﬁnancial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management
judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the eﬀect of matters that are inherently
uncertain and unpredictable.
45
Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives
Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with ﬁnancial institution clients,
merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives
designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance,
winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are
primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identiﬁable beneﬁt at fair
value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized
systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These
estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance
expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new
contracts.
Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and
transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported
information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and
economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.
Impact if actual results diﬀer from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our
estimates, client incentives may be materially diﬀerent than initially recorded. Increases in incentive
payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net
revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not
expected to have a material eﬀect on our ﬁnancial condition, results of operations or cash ﬂows. The
cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable
and estimable.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are
not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is
required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory
proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Signiﬁcant judgment may be required in the
determination of both probability and whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are
subjective and based on a number of factors, including management’s understanding of the legal or
regulatory proﬁle and the speciﬁcs of each proceeding, our history with similar matters, advice of
internal and external legal counsel and management’s best estimate of incurred loss. As additional
information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise
our estimates.
We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain
litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from
settlements of, or ﬁnal judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use
of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either
higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility
plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to
the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any ﬁnes or penalties incurred in
the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective
Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in
Item 8 of this report.
Impact if actual results diﬀer from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and
regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially
diﬀerent than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse eﬀects on our business, ﬁnancial
conditions and results of operations in the period in which the eﬀect becomes probable and reasonably
estimable. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this
report.
Income Taxes
Critical estimates. In calculating our eﬀective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding
certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among
various tax jurisdictions.
46
Table of Contents
Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax ﬁling positions with regard to the timing and
amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on
our interpretation of local tax laws. We also inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions
taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and record liabilities for the amount of such positions that
may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing
authorities.
Impact if actual results diﬀer from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and
judgments are reasonable, actual results may diﬀer from these estimates. Some or all of these
judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were
to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax beneﬁt we have recorded, and we
were unable to realize this beneﬁt, it could have a material adverse eﬀect on our ﬁnancial condition,
results of operations or cash ﬂows.
ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our
exposure to ﬁnancial market risks results primarily from ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations that are primarily related
to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated
transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage
these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in
the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash ﬂows. Our
foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the
impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.
As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the eﬀect of a hypothetical 10% weakening in the value of the
functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of approximately $236 million
and $220 million, respectively, on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The loss from this
hypothetical weakening would be largely oﬀset by a corresponding gain on our cash ﬂows from foreign
currency-denominated revenues and payments. See Note 1—Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
and Note 13—Derivative and Hedging Instruments to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in
Item 8 of this report.
We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the
functional currency of Visa Europe is the Euro. Translation from the Euro to the U.S. dollar is performed
for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in eﬀect at the balance sheet dates and for revenue
and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments
are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated
balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the
exchange rate as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 would result in a foreign currency translation
adjustment of $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we designated €3.0 billion and €1.2 billion, respectively, of our
Euro-denominated senior notes as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange
rate exposure from our net investment in Visa Europe. Foreign currency translation adjustments resulting
from the designated portion of the Euro-denominated senior notes partially oﬀset the foreign currency
translation adjustments resulting from our net investment in Visa Europe. See Note 1—Summary of
Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative and Hedging Instruments to our consolidated
ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises
from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for
balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures,
including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading
counterparties.
47
Table of Contents
Interest Rate Risk
Our investment portfolio assets are held in both ﬁxed-rate and adjustable-rate securities.
Investments in ﬁxed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of ﬁxed-rate
securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate
environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a
lower rate, generating less interest income. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical 100
basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in the fair value of our
investment securities of approximately $43 million and $47 million, respectively. Any realized losses
resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.
Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity.
We have interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior
notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of ﬁxed and ﬂoating
rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements eﬀectively convert a
portion of our U.S. dollar denominated ﬁxed-rate payments into U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated
ﬂoating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with
market interest rate ﬂuctuations. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point
increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $40 million in annual
interest expense for each ﬁscal year. See Note 13—Derivative and Hedging Instruments to our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Equity Investment Risk
Our equity investments are held in both marketable and non-marketable equity securities. The
marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and the non-marketable equity securities are
investments in privately held companies. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our
marketable equity securities was $163 million and $291 million, respectively, and the carrying value of
our non-marketable equity securities was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. These securities are
subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value
of our holdings. A decline in ﬁnancial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a
loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies. We regularly review our non-
marketable equity securities for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts
and changes in circumstances inﬂuencing the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash ﬂows and
capital needs, and the viability of its business model.

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash ﬂows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements).
We also have audited the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of September 30, 2023,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the ﬁnancial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of
its operations and its cash ﬂows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30,
2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, eﬀective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of
September 30, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated ﬁnancial statements, for maintaining
eﬀective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, and for its assessment of the eﬀectiveness of internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated
ﬁnancial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on
our audits. We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether eﬀective
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Our audits
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Our audit of
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating eﬀectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm—(Continued)
Deﬁnition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material eﬀect on the ﬁnancial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of eﬀectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter
below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to
which it relates.
Assessment of the litigation accrual for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement
in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)
As discussed in Notes 5 and 20 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Company is party to
various legal proceedings including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Individual
Merchant Actions, and has recorded a litigation accrual of $1,621 million as of September 30, 2023.
In preparing its consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability
of loss associated with each legal proceeding and estimate the amount of such loss, if any. The
outcome of legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of
the Company and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.
We identiﬁed the assessment of the litigation accrual for class members opting out of the Damages
Class settlement in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL), also known as the MDL – Individual
Merchant Actions, as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves claims that are subject to
inherent uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the litigation accrual for
the MDL – Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the
assumptions and estimation associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes.
The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the
outcome of merchants’ claims, which could have a material eﬀect on the estimated amount of the
liability in the period in which the eﬀect becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We
evaluated the design and tested the operating eﬀectiveness of certain internal controls related to
the Company’s litigation accrual process for the MDL – Individual Merchant Actions. We evaluated
the Company’s ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded
liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that
opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. To assess the estimated monetary exposure in the
Company’s analysis, we compared such amounts to the complete population of amounts
attributable to the remaining opt-out merchants. We performed a sensitivity analysis over the
Company’s monetary exposure calculations, and we recalculated the amount of the ending litigation
accrual. We read letters received directly from the Company’s external legal counsel and internal
legal counsel that discussed the Company’s legal matters, including the MDL – Individual Merchant
Actions. We also considered relevant publicly available information.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2023
Note 1—Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
Organization. Visa Inc. (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that
facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa
operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which provides
transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company oﬀers
products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and eﬃcient money movement for
participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a ﬁnancial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or
set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant
relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s ﬁnancial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts
of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-
owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the
primary beneﬁciary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated
ﬁnancial statements as of and for the periods presented. Intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
During ﬁscal 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia, impacting Visa and its clients. In
March 2022, the Company suspended its operations in Russia and deconsolidated its Russian subsidiary.
The Company’s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of
the other. All signiﬁcant operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business.
The Company has one reportable segment, Payment Services.
Use of estimates. The preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and
assumptions aﬀect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional
information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual
results could diﬀer materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in speciﬁc accounting policies
is described further below as appropriate.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the
date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to
their generally short maturities. The Company deﬁnes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as
cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. See Note 4
—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.
Restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow. The Company maintains an escrow account from
which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See
Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters for a discussion
of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow funds are held in money market investments, and classiﬁed as
restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is
recognized in investment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair value. The Company measures certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring
basis. Certain non-ﬁnancial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and
technology are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are
reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments.
Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in investment
securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in publicly traded companies as well
as mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation and beneﬁt plans. Interest and
dividend income as well as gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from changes in fair value are
recognized in investment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations.
60
Table of Contents
VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2023
Trading activity in the mutual fund investments is at the direction of the Company’s employees.
These investments are held in a trust and are not considered by the Company to be available for its
operational or liquidity needs. The corresponding liability is reported in accrued liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets, with changes in the liability recognized in personnel expense on the
consolidated statements of operations.
Available-for-sale debt securities. The Company’s investments in debt securities, which are
classiﬁed as available-for-sale and reported in investment securities or cash and cash equivalents on the
consolidated balance sheets, include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury
securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The
Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs.
Investments with stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments
that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classiﬁed as current assets, while all other
securities are classiﬁed as non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in other
comprehensive income (loss). The speciﬁc identiﬁcation method is used to calculate realized gain or loss
on the sale of securities, which is recorded in investment income (expense) and other on the
consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned and is included in
investment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis. When there has
been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes
an impairment in investment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations
if it has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to
sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. In addition, if the Company identiﬁes that
the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, the credit loss component is recognized as an
allowance on the consolidated balance sheets and in investment income (expense) and other on the
consolidated statements of operations. The non-credit loss component remains in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) until realized from a sale or subsequent impairment.
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities, which are
reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held
entities without readily determinable fair values. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity
securities are recognized in investment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of
operations.
The Company applies the equity method of accounting when it does not have control but has the
ability to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the entity. Under the equity method, the Company’s share of
each entity’s proﬁt or loss is recognized in investment income (expense) and other on the consolidated
statements of operations.
The Company applies the fair value measurement alternative for equity securities in certain other
entities when it does not have the ability to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the entity. The Company
adjusts the carrying value of these equity securities to fair value when orderly transactions for identical
or similar investments of the same issuer are observable.
The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the equity method and the fair
value measurement alternative for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts
and changes in circumstances inﬂuencing the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash ﬂows and
capital needs, and the viability of its business model.
Financial instruments. The Company considers the following to be ﬁnancial instruments: cash, cash
equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, investment securities, settlement receivable
and payable, accounts receivable, customer collateral, non-marketable equity securities and derivative
instruments. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments.
Settlement receivable and payable. The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and
settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company’s ﬁnancial
institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance.
Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two
business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement
receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets.

VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2023
Customer collateral. The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain
clients in order to ensure that their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment
services are processed in accordance with the Company’s operating rules. The cash collateral assets are
restricted and fully oﬀset by corresponding liabilities, and both balances are presented on the
consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in accounts under the
Company’s name and ownership. The Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but
may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of
credit are provided primarily by a client’s ﬁnancial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of
payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by a client’s parent to secure the obligations of its
subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the ﬁnancial viability of institutions providing the letters
of credit and guarantees. See Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management.
Guarantees and indemniﬁcations. The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for
guarantees and indemniﬁcations that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence.
The Company indemniﬁes its ﬁnancial institution clients for settlement losses suﬀered due to the failure
of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. The
Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for those credit losses related to
its settlement indemniﬁcation obligations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement
indemniﬁcation is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Property, equipment and technology, net. Property, equipment and technology are recorded at
historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line
basis over the asset’s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture,
ﬁxtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term. Building
improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years.
Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset’s
remaining useful life. Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated.
Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets
obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the
VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project
stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are
capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology’s estimated useful life. Acquired technology
assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be
recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash ﬂows is less than the carrying amount
of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of
the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 7—Property, Equipment and Technology, Net.
Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (ROU)
assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the
present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company
considers only payments that are ﬁxed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of
the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate
based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease
payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is
recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The
Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or
less.
Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components
primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease
payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets,
which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The current portion of lease
liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s lease cost is included in general and administrative
expense on the consolidated statements of operations and consists of amounts recognized under lease
agreements, adjusted for impairment and sublease income.

VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2023
Business combinations. The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition
method and accordingly, the identiﬁable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree are generally recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identiﬁable intangible assets, is
recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are
incurred.
Intangible assets, net and goodwill. The Company records identiﬁable intangible assets at fair value
on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each asset.
Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names obtained
through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested
for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years.
Indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired
rights. Intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.
The Company ﬁrst assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a
quantitative impairment test for indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category
of indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the
allocation of cash ﬂows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if
the fair value of the indeﬁnite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired
in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting
unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment
may exist.
The Company performed its annual impairment review of indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets and
goodwill as of February 1, 2023, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent
events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of September 30, 2023. See
Note 8—Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Accrued litigation. The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or
regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are
subjective and based on a number of factors, including the speciﬁcs of such legal or regulatory
proceedings, the merits of the Company’s defenses and consultation with internal and external legal
counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may diﬀer materially from the
Company’s estimates. The Company expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees on the
consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters.
Revenue recognition. The Company’s net revenues are comprised principally of the following
categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other
revenues, reduced by client incentives. As a payments network service provider, the Company’s
obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to Visa’s payments network
over the contractual term, facilitate the processing of payment transactions, including authorization,
clearing and settlement, and deliver related products and services. The Company delivers its payments
network services directly to issuers and acquirers, who provide those services to others within the
payments network: the merchants and consumers. The Company considers all parties in Visa’s
payments network as customers. The Company earns net revenues primarily from issuers and acquirers.
Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments
volume on Visa’s products. The transaction price for each speciﬁc service is reported net of discounts
attributable to individual services or fees. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other
similar taxes, as the payments network services are performed in an amount that reﬂects the
consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company has elected
the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payments
network services and other performance obligations which are constrained by and dependent upon the
future performance of its clients, which are variable in nature. The Company also recognizes revenues,
net of sales and other similar taxes, from other value added services, including issuing solutions,
acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions, open banking and advisory services, as these value
added services are performed.
63
Table of Contents
VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2023
Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage
of Visa payment services. These revenues include fees related to payments volumes. Visa’s obligation is
to stand ready to provide continuous access to Visa’s payments network and related services with
respect to Visa-branded payments programs. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed
using a calculation of current quarter’s pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume.
Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement; value
added services related to issuing, acceptance, and risk and identity solutions; network access; and other
maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the
Company’s clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related
transactions occur or services are performed.
International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency
conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer or ﬁnancial
institution originating the transaction is diﬀerent from that of the beneﬁciary. International transaction
revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are
performed.
Other revenues consist mainly of value added services related to advisory, marketing and certain
card beneﬁts; license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology; and fees for account holder services,
certiﬁcation and licensing. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions
occur or services are performed.
Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with ﬁnancial institution clients,
merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives
designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance,
winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa’s network and driving innovation. Incentives are
classiﬁed as reductions to net revenues within client incentives, unless the incentive is a cash payment
made in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer, in which case the payment is
classiﬁed as operating expense. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and ﬁxed incentive
payments as client incentive assets under these agreements when paid and amortizes the amounts as a
reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer
based on performance targets are recorded when earned and disclosed as client incentive liabilities and
as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These
accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on
changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or
the execution of new contracts. Client incentive assets and liabilities are classiﬁed on the consolidated
balance sheets as current or long-term based on a 12-month operating cycle.
Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of
media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over
the period in which the Company beneﬁts from the sponsorship rights. Promotional costs are expensed
as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs.
Income taxes. The Company’s income tax expense consists of two components: current and
deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reﬂect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
diﬀerences between the ﬁnancial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing
assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary diﬀerences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets
are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not
expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable
income over the periods in which the temporary diﬀerences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning
strategies.
Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and
discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions in interest expense and investment income (expense) and other, respectively, on
the consolidated statements of operations. The Company ﬁles a consolidated federal income tax return
and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any
given year if such election is beneﬁcial to the Company. See Note 19—Income Taxes.

Foreign currency remeasurement and translation. The Company’s functional currency is the U.S.
dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe Limited (Visa Europe) whose
functional currency is the Euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable
functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction
date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using
exchange rates in eﬀect at the balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured
at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to
conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense on the consolidated
statements of operations and were not material for ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.
Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to
the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in eﬀect at the balance
sheet dates and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period.
Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.
Derivative and hedging instruments. The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative
contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency
denominated operational cash ﬂows. The terms of these derivative contracts designated as cash ﬂow
hedges are generally no more than 12 months. The Company uses regression analysis to assess hedge
eﬀectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The eﬀectiveness tests are performed on foreign
exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to
changes in the spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction.
Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and
losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative contracts designated as cash ﬂow hedges
are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). When the forecasted transaction occurs and is
recognized in earnings, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to that
hedge is reclassiﬁed to the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where
revenue or expense is recorded. Forward points are excluded from eﬀectiveness testing purposes and
are reported in earnings. Derivatives designated as cash ﬂow hedges are subject to master netting
agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable
positions with the same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the
Company presents fair values on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company holds foreign exchange forward derivative contracts and other non-derivative
ﬁnancial instruments which were designated as net investment hedges against a portion of the
Company’s net investment in Visa Europe. The Company also holds interest rate and cross-currency
swap agreements on a portion of the outstanding senior notes that allows the Company to manage its
interest rate exposure through a combination of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rates and reduce the overall cost of
borrowing. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges and the cross-currency
swaps as net investment hedges. Gains and losses related to hedging instruments for fair value hedges
are recognized in interest expense along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in the
fair value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item on the consolidated statements of
operations. Gains and losses related to hedging instruments for net investment hedges are recorded in
other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts excluded from the eﬀectiveness testing of net investment
hedges are recognized in earnings.
The Company utilizes foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to hedge against foreign
currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these derivative
instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative expense on
the consolidated statements of operations.
Cash ﬂows associated with a cash ﬂow hedge are classiﬁed as an operating activity on the
consolidated statements of cash ﬂows. Cash ﬂows associated with a fair value hedge may be included in
operating, investing or ﬁnancing activities depending on the classiﬁcation of the items being hedged.
Cash ﬂows associated with a net investment hedge are classiﬁed as an investing activity. See Note 13—
Derivative and Hedging Instruments.
Share-based compensation. The Company measures share-based compensation cost at the grant
date, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the estimated fair value of the award. The Company
recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance-
based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The
65

amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on
management’s best estimate throughout the performance period. See Note 17—Share-based
Compensation.
Earnings per share. The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to
reﬂect the diﬀerent rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and participating securities outstanding
during the period. Participating securities include the Company’s series A, B and C preferred stock and
restricted stock units (RSUs) that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Net
income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional
ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class
of common stock reﬂects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 15—Stockholders’
Equity.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities
outstanding and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock
issuable upon the conversion of series A, B and C preferred stock and class B and C common stock based
on the conversion rates in eﬀect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock
calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options,
the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed
vesting of unearned performance shares. See Note 16—Earnings Per Share.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients
and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that
reference the London Interbank Oﬀered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be
discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued amendments to this
standard. The amendments in the ASU are eﬀective upon issuance through December 31, 2024. During
ﬁscal 2023, the Company adopted certain optional expedients provided in this ASU in relation to contract
modiﬁcations and hedge accounting. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
Note 2—Acquisitions
Pending Acquisition
In June 2023, Visa entered into a deﬁnitive agreement to acquire Pismo Holdings, a cloud-native
issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Paciﬁc and Europe,
for $1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable
regulatory reviews and approvals.
Fiscal 2022 Acquisitions
Currencycloud. In December 2021, Visa acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited
(Currencycloud), a global platform that enables ﬁnancial institutions and ﬁntechs to provide innovative
cross-border foreign exchange solutions, for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which
includes the fair value of Visa’s previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). The Company allocated
$150 million of the purchase consideration to technology, customer relationships, other net assets
acquired and deferred tax liabilities and the remaining $743 million to goodwill.
Tink. In March 2022, Visa acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink AB (Tink) for $1.9 billion in
cash. Tink is an open banking platform that enables ﬁnancial institutions, ﬁntechs and merchants to
build ﬁnancial products and services and move money. The acquisition is expected to help accelerate the
adoption of open banking around the world by providing a secure, reliable platform for innovation.

Note 3—Revenues
The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash ﬂows and how
they are aﬀected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue

Remaining performance obligations are comprised of deferred revenues and contract revenues that
will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods primarily related to value added services.
As of September 30, 2023, the remaining performance obligations were $2.9 billion. The Company
expects approximately half to be recognized as revenue in the next two years and the remaining
thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is aﬀected by several factors,
including contract modiﬁcations and terminations, which could impact the estimate of amounts allocated
to remaining performance obligations and when such revenues could be recognized.

Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
The Company has established several related mechanisms designed to address potential liability
under certain litigation (U.S. covered litigation). These mechanisms are included in and referred to as the
U.S. retrospective responsibility plan and consist of a U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the conversion
feature of the Company’s shares of class B common stock, the indemniﬁcation obligations of the Visa
U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.) members, an interchange judgment sharing agreement, a loss sharing
agreement and an omnibus agreement, as amended.
U.S. covered litigation consists of a number of matters that have been settled or otherwise fully or
substantially resolved, as well as the following:
•the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases
currently included in MDL 1720, any other case that includes claims for damages relating to the
period prior to the Company’s initial public oﬀering (IPO) that has been or is transferred for
coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of
competent jurisdiction; 
•any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such
claim is transferred for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720
by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by
order of any court of competent jurisdiction; and
•any case brought after October 22, 2015 by a merchant that opted out of the Rule 23(b)(3)
settlement class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to
those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. See
Note 20—Legal Matters.
U.S. litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the
Company maintains an escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered
litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is determined by the board of directors and the Company’s
litigation committee, all members of which are aﬃliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members.
The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation
escrow account balance. See Note 20—Legal Matters.

funds (685) (295)
Balance as of end of period $ 1,764 $ 1,449 
These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 20—Legal Matters.
Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow
account, the value of the Company’s class B common stock is subject to dilution through a downward
adjustment to the rate at which shares of class B common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A
common stock. This has the same economic eﬀect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s
class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-
converted class A common stock share count with each deposit amount. See Note 15—Stockholders’
Equity.
Indemniﬁcation obligations. To the extent that amounts available under the U.S. litigation escrow
arrangement and other agreements in the plan are insuﬃcient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation,
the Company will use commercially reasonable eﬀorts to enforce the indemniﬁcation obligations of Visa
U.S.A.’s members for such excess amounts, including but not limited to enforcing indemniﬁcation
obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.’s certiﬁcate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their
membership agreements.
Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International Service Association
(Visa International) have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa
U.S.A. members that have been named as defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is
described in Note 20—Legal Matters. Under this judgment sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that
are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a ﬁnal judgment not allocated to
the conduct of Mastercard.
Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa
International and certain Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the
indemniﬁcation of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in certain circumstances, Visa with respect to:
(i) the amount of a ﬁnal judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the U.S. covered litigation
after the operation of the U.S. litigation escrow arrangement, conversion feature of the Company’s class
B common stock and interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to the
interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a
U.S. covered litigation that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.’s certiﬁcate of incorporation by the
vote of Visa U.S.A.’s speciﬁed voting members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the
loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any ﬁnal judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa
International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement, or the amount of
any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such bank’s then-current membership
proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.’s certiﬁcate of incorporation.
On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The
amendment includes within the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment
by an opt-out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or
circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not transferred to or
otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange
judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of
those agreements as well.
Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with Mastercard and certain Visa
U.S.A. members that conﬁrmed and memorialized the signatories’ intentions with respect to the loss
sharing agreement, the interchange judgment sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the(1)
(1)
interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20—Legal Matters. Under the omnibus agreement, the
monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus
agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. In
addition, the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-
69
Table of Contents
VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2023
related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated as a Visa portion. Visa would
have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Mastercard-related claims in
accordance with the omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or
Mastercard-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would
be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a
settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with
speciﬁed provisions of the Company’s U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on
the consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus
agreement.
On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus
amendment makes applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict
litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary
portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the omnibus agreement
would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. The omnibus
amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class settlement agreement, Visa and
Mastercard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds
and Mastercard shall have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of
the termination of the settlement agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to
defendants.
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
UK loss sharing agreement. The Company has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa
Europe and certain of Visa Europe’s member ﬁnancial institutions located in the United Kingdom (UK LSA
members). Each of the UK LSA members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the
Company for certain losses which may be incurred by the Company, Visa Europe or their aﬃliates as a
result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic
multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the closing of the Visa Europe
acquisition (Closing), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each UK
LSA member, up to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA
member. The UK LSA members’ obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon,
among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of €1.0
billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced the conversion rate of the
series B preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock having
been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate
setting in the Visa Europe territory.
Litigation management deed. The Company has entered into a litigation management deed with
Visa Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory
covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory covered losses)
between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated conversion or reduction in the
conversion rate of the shares of series B and C preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies
only to VE territory covered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). The litigation management
deed provides that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation,
subject to certain obligations to report and consult with the litigation management committee for VE
territory covered litigation (VE Territory Litigation Management Committee). The VE Territory Litigation
Management Committee, which is composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, has
also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory
covered litigation.
The Company obtained certain protections for VE territory covered losses through the series B and C
preferred stock, the UK loss sharing agreement, and the litigation management deed, (collectively
Europe retrospective responsibility plan). The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant
liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the
Closing. Visa’s protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates
to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe
territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not protect the
Company in Europe against all types of litigation or remedies or ﬁnes imposed in competition law
enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation speciﬁcally covered by the plan’s terms.
Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does
not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to
recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock
conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The total amount of protection
available through the preferred stock component of the
70
Table of Contents
VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2023
Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock,
which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of
preferred stock; (b) the current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa’s
class A common stock price. This amount diﬀers from the value of the preferred stock recorded within
stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The book value of the preferred
stock reﬂects its historical value recorded at the Closing less VE territory covered losses recovered
through a reduction of the applicable conversion rate. The book value does not reﬂect changes in the
underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.
Visa Inc. net income is not impacted by VE territory covered losses as long as the as-converted
value of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses are recorded
when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney’s fees,
when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records a reduction to stockholders’ equity, which represents
the Company’s right to recover such losses through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the
preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders’ equity is recorded in the contra-equity account right to
recover for covered losses.
VE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable
conversion rate is eﬀected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month
period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month
limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously
recorded in right to recover for covered losses is then recorded against the book value of the preferred
stock within stockholders’ equity.
As required by the litigation management deed, on June 21, 2022, the sixth anniversary of the Visa
Europe acquisition, Visa, in consultation with the VE Territory Litigation Management Committee, carried
out a release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $3.5 billion of
the as-converted value from its series B and C preferred stock and issued 176,655 shares of series A
preferred stock on July 29, 2022 (Sixth Anniversary Release). Each holder of a share of series B and C
preferred stock received a number of series A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion
adjustment divided by 100. The Company paid $3 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of
series A preferred stock. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity.

quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is
measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation
plan.
Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as
provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not
identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can
be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

Equity Securities
The Company’s non-marketable equity securities include investments in privately held companies
without readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-
recurring basis and are classiﬁed as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent
lack of liquidity and the fact that signiﬁcant inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and
require management’s judgment.

Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on
quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the ﬁnancial
statements, these instruments would be classiﬁed as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of
September 30, 2023, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $20.5 billion and
$17.7 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt
was $22.5 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively.
Other ﬁnancial instruments not measured at fair value. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying
values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due
to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the ﬁnancial statements, these ﬁnancial
instruments would be classiﬁed as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

unsubordinated debt. The senior notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not
guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in
compliance with all related covenants. Each series of senior notes may be redeemed as a whole or in
part at the Company’s option at any time at speciﬁed redemption prices. In addition, each series of the

Commercial Paper Program
Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for
other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0
billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. As of
September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no outstanding obligations under the program.
Credit Facility
In May 2023, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a ﬁve-year,
unsecured $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in May 2028. Interest on borrowings will
be charged at the applicable reference rate or an alternative base rate as deﬁned in the credit
agreement based on the currency and type of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on the
applicable credit rating of the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to
pay a commitment fee which will ﬂuctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. As of
September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. This credit facility is
maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate
purposes. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the
credit facility.
Note 11—Pension and Other Postretirement Beneﬁts
Deﬁned Beneﬁt and Other Postretirement Plans
The Company sponsors qualiﬁed and non-qualiﬁed deﬁned beneﬁt pension and other postretirement
beneﬁt plans that provide for retirement and medical beneﬁts for all eligible employees residing in the
U.S. The Company also sponsors other pension beneﬁt plans that provide beneﬁts for internationally-
based employees at certain non-U.S. locations. The Company’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension and other
postretirement beneﬁt plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various assumptions such as the
discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Disclosures below include U.S. pension
plans and certain non-U.S. pension plans. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its
pension and other postretirement beneﬁt plans.
The U.S. pension plans are closed to new entrants and frozen. However, existing plan participants
continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at the time of the freeze. Additionally, the Visa
Europe plans are closed to new entrants. However, future beneﬁts continue to accrue for active
participants.
The funded status of the Company’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is substantially recorded in other
assets on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the diﬀerence between the fair value of
plan assets and the accumulated beneﬁt obligation. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, for U.S.
pension plans, the fair value of plan assets was $1.0 billion and $960 million, respectively, accumulated
beneﬁt obligation was $640 million and $663 million, respectively, and the funded status was $374
million and $297 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, for non-U.S. pension plans,
the fair value of plan assets was $317 million and $327 million, respectively, accumulated beneﬁt
obligation was $287 million and $278 million, respectively, and funded status was $30 million and $49
million, respectively.
As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) before tax for U.S. pension plans was ($82) million and ($150) million, respectively. As of
September 30, 2023 and 2022, the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) before tax for non-U.S. pension plans was ($87) million and ($35) million, respectively.
Deﬁned Contribution Plan
The Company sponsors a deﬁned contribution plan, or 401(k) plan, that covers its employees
residing in the U.S. In ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, personnel expenses included $192 million, $161
million, and $141 million,
80

September 30, 2023
respectively, attributable to the Company’s employees under the 401(k) plan. The Company’s
contributions to this 401(k) plan are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized
in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred.
Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemniﬁes its clients for settlement losses suﬀered due to failure of any other client
to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemniﬁcation
creates settlement risk for the Company due to the diﬀerence in timing between the date of a payment
transaction and the date of subsequent settlement.
Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk
guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees,
are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.
The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment
transactions at any point in time, which vary signiﬁcantly day to day. For ﬁscal 2023, the Company’s
maximum daily settlement exposure was $126.9 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was
$77.1 billion.
The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to
manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are
not met. The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure:

The ﬁscal 2022 amounts have been revised to conform to the ﬁscal 2023 presentation.
For ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized an increase (decrease) in earnings related
to excluded forward points from forward contracts designated as net investment hedges and interest
diﬀerentials from swap agreements of ($25) million, $151 million and $156 million, respectively.
Cash ﬂow hedges. For ﬁscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized pre-tax net gains (losses)
from cash ﬂow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss) of ($126) million and $190 million,
respectively. The amount recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) was not material for ﬁscal
2021.
The Company estimates that $46 million of pre-tax net gains related to cash ﬂow hedges recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2023 will be reclassiﬁed into the
consolidated statements of operations within the next 12 months.
Net investment hedges. For ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized pre-tax net gains
(losses) in other comprehensive income (loss) related to net investment hedges of ($445) million,
$845 million and $20 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company designated
€3.0 billion and €1.2 billion, respectively, of Euro notes, a non-derivative ﬁnancial instrument, as a
hedge against a portion of the Company’s Euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe.
Credit and market risks. The Company’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments are subject to both credit
and market risk. The Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the ﬁnancial institutions that are
counterparties to its derivative ﬁnancial instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty
nonperformance to be signiﬁcant. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into master netting
agreements, and such agreements require each party to post collateral against its net liability position
with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has received collateral of $91
million from counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets,
and posted collateral of $47 million, which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on
the consolidated balance sheets. Notwithstanding the Company’s eﬀorts to manage foreign exchange
risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will adequately protect against the
risks associated with foreign currency ﬂuctuations. As of September 30, 2023, credit and market risks
related to derivative instruments were not considered signiﬁcant.(1)

Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover
VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates
applicable to the series B and C preferred stock, and is required to undertake periodic release
assessments following the anniversary of the Visa Europe acquisition to determine if value should be
released from the series B and C preferred stock. The recovery and any releases of value have the same
economic eﬀect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock because it
reduces the series B and C preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted
class A common stock share count. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

In December 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase
program and in October 2022, authorized an additional $12.0 billion share repurchase program (October
2022 Program). As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s October 2022 Program had remaining
authorized funds of $5.0 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the October 2022
Program have been completed. In October 2023, the Company’s board of directors authorized a new
$25.0 billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year ﬂexibility. These authorizations have no
expiration date.
Dividends. In ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company declared and paid dividends of $3.8 billion,
$3.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. On October 24, 2023, the Company’s board of directors
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case
of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis), payable
on December 1, 2023, to all holders of record as of November 9, 2023.
Class B common stock. Under the current certiﬁcate of incorporation, the class B common stock is
not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been ﬁnally
resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of
class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible
into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as deﬁned in the
current certiﬁcate of incorporation) or similar person or an aﬃliate of a Visa Member or similar person.
Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of
shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in eﬀect at the time of such
transfer.
Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on oﬀering of class
A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash
deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion
rate; or (ii) the ﬁnal resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on
deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the
conversion rate. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
In September 2023, the Company announced that it was engaging with its common stockholders on
the subject of potential amendments to the certiﬁcate of incorporation that, if proposed, approved and
implemented, would authorize Visa to conduct an exchange oﬀer program that would have the eﬀect of
releasing transfer restrictions on portions of Visa’s Class B common stock prior to the ﬁnal resolution of
the U.S. covered litigation.
Class C common stock. There are no existing transfer restrictions on class C common stock.
Preferred stock. In connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three series of preferred stock of the
Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in
regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company’s class A common stock. Preferred stock may
be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and has preference over any class of common stock with
respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Company’s assets in the event of a
liquidation or dissolution.
The series B and C preferred stock is convertible upon certain conditions into shares of class A
common stock or series A preferred stock. The shares of series B and C preferred stock are subject to
restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory
covered litigation. The shares of series B and C preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th
anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-
pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the series B and C preferred stock (whether by such 12th
anniversary, or thereafter with respect to claims pending on such anniversary), the conversion rate
would be adjusted downward and the holder would receive either class A common stock or series A
preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company’s
certiﬁcate of incorporation). The conversion rates may also be reduced from time to time to oﬀset
certain liabilities.
The series A preferred stock, generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company’s
class A common stock, is freely transferable and each share of series A preferred stock will automatically
convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold
class A common stock under the charter. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility
Plans.

Voting rights. The holders of the series B and C preferred stock have no right to vote on any
matters, except for certain deﬁned matters, including, in speciﬁed circumstances, any consolidation,
merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would
either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences,
rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of the
applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is diﬀerent from
what the Company’s class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters
on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the
aﬃrmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series
voting as a single class. In either case, the series B and C preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a
number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the series A
preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders
of the series B and C preferred stock.
Class A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally
are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except
for certain deﬁned matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case
the class B and C common stockholders will vote together with the class A common stockholders in a
single class, (ii) in speciﬁed circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction
of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single
class, and (iii) the approval of certain amendments to the Company’s certiﬁcate of incorporation, in
which case class A, B and C common stockholders will vote as a separate class, including if such
amendments aﬀect the terms of class B or C common stock. In these cases, the class B and C common
stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C
common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in eﬀect on the record date. Holders of
the Company’s common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certiﬁcate of
incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock.

Note 17—Share-based Compensation
Equity Incentive Compensation Plan
The Company’s 2007 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (EIP) authorizes
the compensation committee of the board of directors to grant non-qualiﬁed stock options (options),
RSUs, performance-based shares and restricted stock awards to its employees and non-employee
directors, for up to 198 million shares of class A common stock. Shares available for grant may be either
authorized and unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company. Under the
EIP, shares withheld for taxes, or shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award, shall not
again be available for future grant. The EIP will continue to be in eﬀect until all of the common stock
available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is
terminated earlier by the Company’s board of directors.
For ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to
the EIP of $734 million, $571 million and $518 million, respectively, in personnel expense on its
consolidated statements of operations. The related tax beneﬁts for ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were
$112 million, $82 million and $73 million, respectively.
Options
Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over
three years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions.
The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Applied a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding as of September 30, 2023 to estimate the options expected to vest in
the future.
During ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the total intrinsic value of options exercised was $134 million,
$56 million and $124 million, respectively, and the tax beneﬁt realized was $28 million, $11 million and
$23 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, there was $25 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of approximately 0.38 year.
Restricted Stock Units
RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, subject to
earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common
stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s option. The
Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period, RSU award
recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights granted
to the holders of the underlying class A common stock.
The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures is calculated using the closing
price of class A common stock on the date of grant. During ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the weighted-
average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $212.94, $204.73 and $209.00, respectively. During
ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the total grant date fair value of RSUs vested was $486 million, $380 million

Performance-based Shares
For the Company’s performance-based shares, in addition to service conditions, the ultimate
number of shares to be earned depends on the achievement of both performance and market
conditions. The performance condition is based on the Company’s earnings per share target. The market
condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return ranked against that of other companies
that are included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
The fair value of each performance-based shares incorporating the market condition was estimated

As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, net deferred tax assets of $126 million and $87 million,
respectively, were reﬂected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization
of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which those temporary diﬀerences are deductible. The ﬁscal 2023 and 2022 valuation allowances
relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent years. 
As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $1.0 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards,
which may be carried forward indeﬁnitely.

In ﬁscal 2023 and ﬁscal 2022, the eﬀective income tax rates were 18% including the following:
•during ﬁscal 2023, a $142 million tax beneﬁt related to prior years due to the reassessment of an
uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination;
and
•during ﬁscal 2022, a $176 million tax beneﬁt related to prior years due to a decrease in the state
apportionment ratio as a result of a tax position taken related to a ruling.
In ﬁscal 2022 and ﬁscal 2021, the eﬀective income tax rates were 18% and 23%, respectively. The
eﬀective income tax rate in ﬁscal 2022 diﬀers from the eﬀective income tax rate in ﬁscal 2021 primarily
due to the following:
•during ﬁscal 2022, a $176 million tax beneﬁt related to prior years due to a decrease in the state
apportionment ratio as a result of a tax position taken related to a ruling;
•during ﬁscal 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the
remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities as a result of the increase in UK tax rate from 19% to
25%, eﬀective April 1, 2023; and
•during ﬁscal 2021, $255 million of tax beneﬁts recognized as a result of the conclusion of audits
by taxing authorities.
As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, current income taxes receivable of $206 million and $190
million, respectively, were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets; non-current income
taxes receivable of $961 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, were included in other assets; income
taxes payable of $1.5 billion and $365 million, respectively, were included in accrued liabilities; and
accrued income taxes of $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, were included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s operating hub in the Asia Paciﬁc region is located in Singapore. It was subject to a
tax incentive, eﬀective October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2023, conditional upon meeting certain
business operations and employment thresholds in Singapore. In ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the tax
incentive decreased Singapore tax by $468 million, $362 million and $273 million, and the gross beneﬁt
of the tax incentive on diluted earnings per share was $0.22, $0.17 and $0.12, respectively.
The Company is required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to
be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be
sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.

As of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts
were $3.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described
below. Included in the $3.5 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion are $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.3
billion of unrecognized tax beneﬁts, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce the eﬀective tax rate
in a future period.
The following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending unrecognized tax beneﬁts by
ﬁscal year:

Reduction related to lapsing statute of limitations (4) (3) (2)
Balance as of end of period $ 3,497 $ 2,683 $ 2,488 
The increases in unrecognized tax beneﬁts include refund claims ﬁled during the year, an increase
in gross timing diﬀerences, and various tax positions across several jurisdictions. The decrease in
unrecognized tax beneﬁts primarily includes the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of
new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination, as mentioned above.
In ﬁscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $34 million, $15 million and $1 million of
net interest expense, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. In ﬁscal 2023 and 2021, the
Company accrued no signiﬁcant penalties and in ﬁscal 2022, the Company reversed accrued penalties of
$31 million related to uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had
accrued interest of $271 million and $238 million, respectively, and no signiﬁcant accrued penalties
related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for ﬁscal 2016 through 2018 are currently under
examination. For ﬁscal 2008 through 2015, one unresolved issue related to an income tax deduction
remains. During ﬁscal 2022, the Company completed the administrative appeals process for this issue
without reaching a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. The Company is evaluating its next
steps. Except for the unresolved issue, the federal statute of limitations has expired for ﬁscal years prior
to 2016.
The Company’s California income tax returns for ﬁscal 2012 through 2015 are currently under
examination and refund claims ﬁled for ﬁscal 2006 through 2011 are currently under administrative
appeal. Except for the refund claims, the California statute of limitations has expired for ﬁscal years prior
to 2012.
The India tax authorities completed the assessment of the Company’s income tax returns for the
taxable years falling within the period from ﬁscal 2010 to 2021 and made certain adjustments. The
Company objected to these adjustments and ﬁled appeals to the appellate authorities.
The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All
material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through ﬁscal 2007. The timing
and outcome of the ﬁnal resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims
are uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s net unrecognized tax beneﬁts
could decrease by approximately $400 million in the next 12 months.

Note 20—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings
involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For
those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not
estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed
below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss
or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and
regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or ﬁnes or enter into
settlements of claims that could have a material adverse eﬀect on the Company’s ﬁnancial position,
results of operations or cash ﬂows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement
discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its
own behalf or collectively with other parties.
The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation
proﬁle, the speciﬁcs of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best
estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.
The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation:

Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered
by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation.
An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a
loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company
evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation
committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than
the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—
U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation:
For the Years Ended

Payments for U.S. covered litigation (726) (301)
Balance as of end of period $ 1,621 $ 1,441 
During ﬁscal 2023, the Company recorded additional accruals of $906 million and deposited
$1.0 billion into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims of certain merchants who opted out
of the Amended Settlement Agreement (as described herein). The accrual balance is consistent with the
Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to the
U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of
the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary
based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue

to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the
litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if
negotiated resolutions cannot be reached.
Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are
covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan,
the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund
settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through
periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual
for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss
is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory
Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

U.S. Covered Litigation
Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Class Actions
Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions)
were ﬁled in U.S. federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or
Mastercard, and in some cases, certain U.S. ﬁnancial institutions. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New
York (Court) for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class plaintiﬀs
subsequently ﬁled amended and supplemental class complaints. The individual and class complaints
generally challenged, among other things, Visa’s and Mastercard’s purported setting of interchange
reimbursement fees, their “no surcharge” and honor-all-cards rules, alleged tying and bundling of
transaction fees, and Visa’s reorganization and IPO, under the federal antitrust laws and, in some cases,
certain state unfair competition laws. The complaints sought money damages, declaratory and injunctive
relief, attorneys’ fees and, in one instance, an order that the IPO be unwound.
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated, Mastercard International
Incorporated, various U.S. ﬁnancial institution defendants, and the class plaintiﬀs signed a settlement
agreement (2012 Settlement Agreement) to resolve the class plaintiﬀs’ claims. Pursuant to the 2012
Settlement Agreement, the Company deposited approximately $4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow
account and approximately $500 million attributable to interchange reductions for an eight-month period
into court-authorized settlement accounts. Visa subsequently received from the Court and deposited into
the Company’s U.S. litigation escrow account “takedown payments” of approximately $1.1 billion.
On June 30, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower court’s
certiﬁcation of the merchant class, reversed the approval of the settlement, and remanded the case to
the lower court for further proceedings.

September 30, 2023
On remand, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of
plaintiﬀs, a “Damages Class” and an “Injunctive Relief Class.” The plaintiﬀs purporting to act on behalf of
the putative Damages Class subsequently ﬁled a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint,
seeking money damages and attorneys’ fees, among other relief. A new group of purported class
plaintiﬀs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class, ﬁled a class action complaint against
Visa, Mastercard, and certain bank defendants seeking, among other things, an injunction against the
setting of default interchange rates; against certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including
the honor-all-cards rule; and against various transaction fees, including the ﬁxed acquirer network fee,
as well as attorneys’ fees.
On September 17, 2018, Visa, Mastercard, and certain U.S. ﬁnancial institutions reached an
agreement with plaintiﬀs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class to resolve all
Damages Class claims (Amended Settlement Agreement). The Amended Settlement Agreement
supersedes the 2012 Settlement Agreement and includes, among other terms, a release from
participating class members for liability arising out of conduct alleged by the Damages Class in the
litigation, including claims that accrue no later than ﬁve years after the Amended Settlement Agreement
becomes ﬁnal. Participating class members will not release injunctive relief claims as a named
representative or non-representative class member in the putative Injunctive Relief Class. The Amended
Settlement Agreement also required an additional settlement payment from all defendants totaling $900
million, with the Company’s share of $600 million paid from the Company’s litigation escrow account
established pursuant to the Company’s retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe
Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The additional settlement payment was added to the approximately
$5.3 billion previously deposited into settlement accounts by the defendants pursuant to the 2012
Settlement Agreement.
Certain merchants in the proposed settlement class objected to the settlement and/or submitted
requests to opt out of the settlement class. On December 13, 2019, the district court granted ﬁnal
approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement, which was subsequently appealed. Based on the
percentage of class members (by payment volume) that opted out of the class, $700 million was
returned to defendants. Visa’s portion of the takedown payment, approximately $467 million, was
deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account. On March 15, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit aﬃrmed the ﬁnal approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement by the district court.
On August 3, 2023, the district court entered an order appointing a special master to resolve matters
arising out of or relating to the Amended Settlement Agreement’s plan of administration.
On May 29, 2020, a complaint was ﬁled by Old Jericho Enterprise, Inc. against Visa and Mastercard
on behalf of a purported class of gasoline retailers operating in 24 states and the District of Columbia.
On April 28, 2021, a complaint was ﬁled by Hayley Lanning and others, and on June 16, 2021, a
complaint was ﬁled by Camp Grounds Coﬀee and others, each against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of
a purported class of merchants located in 25 states and the District of Columbia who have taken
payment using the Square card acceptance service. Each of these complaints alleges violations of the
antitrust laws of those jurisdictions and seeks recovery for plaintiﬀs as indirect purchasers. To the extent
these plaintiﬀs’ claims are not released by the Amended Settlement Agreement, Visa believes they are
covered by the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan.
On June 1, 2020, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served a motion for summary judgment
regarding the claims in the Injunctive Relief Class complaint. The putative Injunctive Relief Class
plaintiﬀs served a motion for partial summary judgment. On September 27, 2021, the district court
certiﬁed without opt out rights an Injunctive Relief Class consisting of all merchants that accept Visa or
Mastercard credit or debit cards in the United States at any time between December 18, 2020 and entry
of ﬁnal judgment.
Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Individual Merchant Actions
Since May 2013, more than 50 cases have been ﬁled in or removed to various federal district courts
by hundreds of merchants generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in
MDL 1720. The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard
Incorporated and Mastercard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S.
ﬁnancial institutions as defendants. A number of the cases include allegations that Visa has
monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market
segments. Some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain
Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction
fees, including the ﬁxed acquirer network fee. In addition, some cases assert that Visa, Mastercard
and/or their member banks conspired to prevent the adoption of chip-and-PIN authentication in the U.S.
or otherwise circumvent competition in the debit market. Certain individual merchants have ﬁled
amended complaints to, among other things, add claims for injunctive relief and update claims for
damages.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2023
In addition to the cases ﬁled by individual merchants, Visa, Mastercard, and/or certain U.S. ﬁnancial
institution defendants in MDL 1720 ﬁled complaints against certain merchants in the Eastern District of
New York seeking, in part, a declaration that Visa’s conduct did not violate federal or state antitrust laws.
The individual merchant actions described in this section have been either assigned to the judge
presiding over MDL 1720, have been transferred, or are being considered for transfer by the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion in MDL 1720. These individual merchant actions are U.S.
covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe
Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 72% of the
Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement
Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiﬀs.
On June 1, 2020 and July 14, 2023, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served motions for summary
judgment regarding the claims in certain of the individual merchant actions, as well as certain
declaratory judgment claims brought by Visa, Mastercard, and some U.S. ﬁnancial institutions. Plaintiﬀs
in certain of the individual merchant actions served motions for partial summary judgment. On October
9, 2022, defendants’ motion for summary judgment regarding damages for EMV-related chargebacks
was denied.
The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims asserted in the putative class
actions and individual merchant actions, but the ﬁnal outcome of individual legal claims is inherently
unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations
regarding the outcome of merchants’ claims, and such developments could have a material adverse
eﬀect on the Company’s ﬁnancial results in the period in which the eﬀect becomes probable and
reasonably estimable. While the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address monetary
liability in these matters, see Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans, judgments or
settlements that require the Company to change its business practices, rules, or contractual
commitments could adversely aﬀect the Company’s ﬁnancial results.
Consumer Interchange Litigation
On December 30, 2022, a putative class action was ﬁled in California state court against Visa,
Mastercard, and certain ﬁnancial institutions on behalf of all Visa and Mastercard cardholders in
California who made a purchase using a Visa-branded or Mastercard-branded payment card in California
from January 1, 2004. Plaintiﬀs primarily allege a conspiracy to ﬁx interchange fees and seek injunctive
relief, attorneys’ fees and damages as direct and indirect purchasers based on alleged violations of
California law. On January 11, 2023, plaintiﬀs ﬁled an amended complaint asserting the same claims as
asserted in the prior complaint. On January 30, 2023, Visa removed the action to federal court, and the
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation subsequently issued an order transferring the case to MDL 1720.
On June 15, 2023, plaintiﬀs’ motion to remand the case to California state court was denied, and
plaintiﬀs appealed. On July 28, 2023, defendants ﬁled a motion to dismiss that appeal, which was
granted on November 14, 2023.
VE Territory Covered Litigation
Europe Merchant Litigation
Since July 2013, proceedings have been commenced by more than 1,150 Merchants (the capitalized
term “Merchant”, when used in this section, means a Merchant together with subsidiary/aﬃliate
companies that are party to the same claim) against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in
the UK and other countries, primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and, in some cases, relating
to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. They seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct
in relation to one or more of the following types of interchange fees for credit and debit card
transactions: UK domestic, Irish domestic, other European domestic, intra-European Economic Area
and/or other inter-regional. As of the ﬁling date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 175
Merchants, and there are approximately 900 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30
Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered
into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled.
While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been
ﬁled and their full scope is not yet known. The Company has learned that several additional European
entities have indicated they may also bring similar claims, and the Company anticipates additional
claims in the future.

September 30, 2023
A trial took place from November 2016 to March 2017, relating to claims asserted by one Merchant.
In judgments published in November 2017 and February 2018, the court found as to that Merchant that
Visa’s UK domestic interchange did not restrict competition, but that if it had been found to restrict
competition, it would not be exemptible under applicable law. On July 4, 2018, the Court of Appeal
overturned the lower court’s rulings, ﬁnding that Visa’s UK domestic interchange restricted competition
and the question of whether Visa’s UK domestic interchange was exempt from the ﬁnding of restriction
under applicable law had been incorrectly decided. Following an appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United Kingdom, on June 17, 2020, the Supreme Court found that Visa’s UK domestic interchange
restricted competition under applicable competition law. On September 30, 2021, Visa reached a
conﬁdential settlement agreement resolving one Merchant’s claims.
On November 26, 2021, with respect to certain pending Merchant claims, the UK Competition
Appeal Tribunal (CAT) found that UK and certain other domestic and intra-European Economic Area
consumer interchange fees before the introduction of the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) were a
restriction of competition, but that the question of whether those fees, along with inter-European
Economic Area fees, are a restriction of competition after the introduction of the IFR would need to be
resolved at trial. Whether any interchange fees are exempt from the ﬁnding of restriction under
applicable law and the assessment of damages, if any, will also need to be considered at trial. On
October 4, 2022, the UK Court of Appeal aﬃrmed the CAT’s ruling.
On June 1, 2022, two class action claims were ﬁled against Visa with the CAT on behalf of UK
businesses that accepted Visa-branded payment cards at any time since June 1, 2016, alleging that UK
domestic, intra-European Economic Area, and inter-regional interchange fees on commercial credit
cards, and inter-regional interchange fees on consumer cards, are anti-competitive. The Europe
retrospective responsibility plan covers liabilities and losses relating to the covered period, which
generally refers to the period before the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. On June 8, 2023, the UK
Competition Appeal Tribunal denied class certiﬁcation in the two class action claims.
The full scope of potential damages is not yet known because not all Merchant claims have been
served and Visa has substantial defenses. However, the claims that have been issued, served and/or
preserved, seek several billion dollars in damages.
Other Litigation
On November 14, 2021, a motion to certify a class action was ﬁled against Visa and Mastercard in
the Israel Central District Court. The motion asserts that interchange fees on cross-border transactions in
Israel and the Honor All Cards rule are anti-competitive and seeks damages and injunctive relief.
Other Litigation
U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation
National ATM Council Class Action. In October 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank
ATM operators ﬁled a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A.
and Plus System, Inc.) and Mastercard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The
complaint challenges Visa’s rule (and a similar Mastercard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to
charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee cannot be greater than the
access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiﬀs claim that the rule violates Section 1 of
the Sherman Act and seek treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. On August 4, 2021, the
district court granted plaintiﬀs’ motion for class certiﬁcation. On July 25, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals

Consumer Class Actions. In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was ﬁled against Visa
and Mastercard in the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other
purported consumer class actions challenging the rules, later combined, were also ﬁled in October 2011
in the same federal court naming Visa, Mastercard and three ﬁnancial institutions as defendants.
Plaintiﬀs seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees where available under
federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes.
On August 4, 2021, the district court granted plaintiﬀs’ motion for class certiﬁcation in each case. On
August 8, 2022, in the case in which the three ﬁnancial institutions were named, the district court
granted plaintiﬀs’ motion for ﬁnal approval of a class action settlement with those institutions and
entered ﬁnal judgments of dismissal as to those institutions. On July 25, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia aﬃrmed the district court’s class certiﬁcation decision, and on September
27, 2023, defendants’ petition for rehearing en banc was denied.
U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand (2012)
On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (Division)
issued a Civil Investigative Demand (CID), to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a
potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2. The CID focused on PIN-
Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa’s competitive responses to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa’s ﬁxed
acquirer network fee. Visa has cooperated with the Division in connection with the CID.
Pulse Network
On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC ﬁled suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in
Texas, alleging that Visa has, among other things, monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card
network services markets. On August 29, 2022, Pulse ﬁled an amended complaint, which makes similar
allegations and seeks unspeciﬁed treble damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief, including to
enjoin the ﬁxed acquirer network fee structure, and Visa’s agreements relating to debit with issuers,
acquirers and merchants.
EMV Chip Liability Shift
Following their initial complaint ﬁled on March 8, 2016, B&R Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milam’s
Market, and Grove Liquors LLC ﬁled an amended class action complaint on July 15, 2016, against Visa
Inc., Visa U.S.A., Mastercard, Discover, American Express, EMVCo and certain ﬁnancial institutions in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The amended complaint asserts that
defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty, or otherwise rejected
payment card transactions from defendants to the purported class of merchants, deﬁned as those
merchants throughout the U.S. who have been subjected to the “Liability Shift” since October 2015.
Plaintiﬀs claim that the “Liability Shift” violates Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act and certain state
laws, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees.
EMVCo and the ﬁnancial institution defendants were dismissed, and the matter was subsequently
transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which has clariﬁed that this
case is not part of MDL 1720. On August 28, 2020, the district court granted plaintiﬀs’ motion for class
certiﬁcation. On November 30, 2022, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served a motion for summary
judgment regarding the claims in the amended complaint and a motion to decertify the class.
Federal Trade Commission Civil Investigative Demand
On November 4, 2019, the Bureau of Competition of the United States Federal Trade Commission
(Bureau) requested that Visa provide, on a voluntary basis, documents and information relating to an
investigation as to whether Visa’s actions inhibited merchant choice in the selection of debit payments
networks in potential violation of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act. On June 9, 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a CID to Visa
requesting additional documents and information. Visa has cooperated with the FTC in connection with
the CID.
Euronet Litigation
On December 13, 2019, Euronet 360 Finance Limited, Euronet Polska Spolka z.o.o. and Euronet
Services spol. s.r.o. (Euronet) served a claim in the UK alleging that certain rules aﬀecting ATM access
fees in Poland, the Czech Republic and Greece by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated, and certain of
their subsidiaries, breach

various competition laws. Euronet sought damages, costs, and injunctive relief to prevent the
defendants from enforcing these rules. Visa reached a settlement with Euronet, and the claim against
Visa has been dismissed.
European Commission Staged Digital Wallets Investigation
On June 26, 2020, the European Commission (EC) informed Visa that it opened a preliminary
investigation into Visa’s rules regarding staged digital wallets. On February 16, 2023, the EC notiﬁed Visa
that the investigation has been closed.
German ATM Litigation
Beginning in December 2021, Visa was served with claims in Germany brought by German banks
against Visa Europe and Visa Inc. The banks claim that Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of
access fees on domestic cash withdrawals are anti-competitive, and the majority seek damages. Visa
has ﬁled challenges to the jurisdiction of the German courts to hear these claims, one of which was
denied and one of which was granted as to Visa Europe.
U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand (2021)
On March 26, 2021, June 11, 2021, January 4, 2023, and May 2, 2023, the Antitrust Division of the
U.S. Department of Justice (the Division) issued CIDs to Visa, seeking documents and information
regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2. The CIDs focus on
U.S. debit and competition with other payment methods and networks. Visa is cooperating with the
Division in connection with the investigation.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation
Following an initial class action complaint ﬁled on July 9, 2021, an amended class action complaint
was ﬁled on December 6, 2021 against Visa in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California by several individuals on behalf of a purported nationwide class, and/or purported California,
Washington, Massachusetts or New Jersey subclasses, of cardholders who conducted a transaction in a
foreign currency. The amended complaint asserted claims for unjust enrichment and restitution as well
as violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, the
Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. On December 21,
2022, plaintiﬀs ﬁled a third amended complaint asserting the same claims. On August 30, 2023, the
court granted Visa’s motion to dismiss with prejudice and directed the clerk to close the case.
European Commission Client Incentive Agreements Investigation
On December 2, 2022, the EC informed Visa that it had opened a preliminary investigation into
Visa’s incentive agreements with clients. Visa is cooperating with the EC in connection with the
investigation.

ITEM 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosures
Not applicable.
ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁned in the Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that is designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Oﬃcer
and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and our Chief Financial Oﬃcer concluded that, as of
September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were eﬀective at the reasonable assurance
level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our
ﬁnancial reporting. Management assessed the eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting as of September 30, 2023 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
Based on management’s assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting was eﬀective as of September 30, 2023.
The eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of September 30, 2023, has been
audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting ﬁrm, as stated in their report which is
included in Item 8 of this report.
Inherent Limitations on Eﬀectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
Our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the
eﬀectiveness of any system of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. These limitations include the
possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource
constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements and instances of fraud. In addition, because we have designed our
system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood
of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future
conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not
absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. Projections of any evaluation of eﬀectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors of this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In preparation for management’s report on internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, we documented
and tested the design and operating eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. There
have been no changes in our internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred during our fourth
quarter of ﬁscal 2023 that have materially aﬀected, or are reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, our
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
