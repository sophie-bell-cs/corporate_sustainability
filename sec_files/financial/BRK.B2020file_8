Part I
Item 1. Business Description
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a
large number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis
and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution
businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein.
Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or
integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by
Berkshire’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshire’s corporate senior
management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and
the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring
Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages
to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the
resolution of governance-related issues as needed.
Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employ approximately 391,500 people worldwide.
Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses
Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based
insurance entities. Berkshire’s insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty and life, accident
and health risks worldwide.
In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly
subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may
arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or
reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.
Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance
coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the direct insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves
coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-
share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct
insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for
all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts
may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.
Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory
considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or
foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers
compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business
ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.
Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which
they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially
solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and
establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s
authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their
shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts
are subject to prior regulatory approval.
Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to
as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium
rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers.
Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers
who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers.
Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally
not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts.
 
K-1
 
The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The
NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual
statutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its
activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations
and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with
financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements.
U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles
(“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The
standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk
management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing, and are
expected to continue to implement, various regulatory tools and mandates.  For example, the U.S. state regulators now require
insurance groups to file an annual report, called an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead regulator. U.S.
state regulators formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic
international insurance regulators.  The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead group wide supervisor for our group of
insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including a group
capital calculation tool and various liquidity assessments, that could be imposed on insurance groups in the future.  
Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their
competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S. based insurers was approximately $216 billion at
December 31, 2019. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M.
Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program
(“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The
Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act of 2019 (the “2019 TRIA Reauthorization”). Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under
TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry
insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in 2020, or any calendar year thereafter.
To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing
policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal
share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA
participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft,
surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal
reinsurance of terrorism losses.
During 2020 and thereafter, in the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers
(conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an
insurance group’s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant
commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2020 for Berkshire’s
insurance group is expected to approximate $1.3 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of
the federal government coverage for each TRIA year.
The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct
business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the
requirements differ substantially. For example:
 • in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others,
only annual reports;
 • some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators
permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;
 • the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer's use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;
 • policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;
 • the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country;
 • the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary significantly
by country; and
 • regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.
K-2
 
Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee
insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.
Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of
subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in other countries, including Canada, various members of the European
Union, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau and Dubai.  Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital
requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data
privacy and protection program requirements.  Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational
application of certain U.S. laws.
There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the
potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic
developments.
On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (“UK”) voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the EU (“Brexit”), which
resulted in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the UK leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway
European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to
continue to operate in the European Union following Brexit.  Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU as result of Brexit,
Berkshire expects to continue to maintain a substantial presence in London.
Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary
Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products
that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long time
periods (creating “float,” see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and to
reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment
expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments.
Berkshire’s insurance businesses employ approximately 50,000 people. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s
underwriting groups follows.
GEICO—GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government
Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company,
GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County
Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger
automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also insures motorcycles, all-terrain
vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners,
renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO.
GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly
to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through
regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states.
The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private
passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell
directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate (including Esurance),
Progressive and USAA. Significant advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary
policies-in-force of approximately 35% over the past five years. According to most recently published A.M. Best data for 2018, the
five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2018 of approximately 57%, with GEICO’s market share being
second largest at approximately 13.4%. Since the publication of that data, GEICO’s management estimates its current market share
is approximately 13.6%. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather
conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.
State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance
companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to
focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on
customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to
manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects it and other service
marks through appropriate registrations.

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group—The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of
independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the
United States. These various operations are discussed below.
NICO and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an
admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents

Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several cities in the U.S. and international offices
located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia and Europe. BH Specialty currently intends to further
expand its operations. BH Specialty writes business through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general
agents.
MedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance in the United States. MedPro

professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance
solutions in Europe, delivers liability insurance to other professionals, and offers specialized accident and health insurance
solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne,

professional and personal lines insurance on an admitted basis, as well as an excess and surplus basis. USLI markets policies in all
50 states and the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite
and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania.
The Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide
workers’ compensation, business owners’, commercial auto, commercial package and homeowners’ products to over 350,000 small
and mid-sized businesses. GUARD also offers complementary professional liability and umbrella products nationwide.  Policies
are offered through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Central
States Indemnity Company of Omaha, based in Omaha, Nebraska, primarily writes Medicare Supplement insurance.
On October 1, 2018, NICO acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”). MLMIC has been the leading writer of
medical professional liability insurance in New York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes its policies mostly on a direct
basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. In October 2019, Berkshire sold its 81% interest in
Applied Underwriters, Inc. (“Applied”).
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group—Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire
Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers
and reinsurers worldwide. Reinsurance business is written through National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in
Nebraska, its subsidiaries and various other insurance subsidiaries wholly owned by Berkshire (collectively, the “NICO Group”)
and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s
underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. BHRG also conducts business activities globally in 23
countries.
The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and
coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived
level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance
transactions.
 
 
 
 
K-4
 
Property/casualty
The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis,
catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual
risks for clients worldwide. The NICO Group periodically participates in underwriting placements with major brokers in the
London Market through Berkshire Hathaway International Insurance, Ltd., based in Great Britain. Business is written through
intermediary brokers or directly with the insured or reinsured.
The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from
changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual
reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited
(“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia Pacific countries. The
General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-
share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a
facultative basis.
General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which
is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in
North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 13 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada.
In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity
Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and
professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general
underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive
customers.
General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG
(“GRAG”), based in Cologne Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in 23 countries. International business
is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns
the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of
Syndicate 435.
Life/health
The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the
General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business
is marketed on a direct basis. Approximately 27% of the aggregate life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group were
in the United States, compared to 18% in Western Europe and 55% throughout the rest of the world.
Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write
reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures.
BHLN and its affiliates have also periodically reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income, and similar benefit coverages
on closed-blocks of variable annuity reinsurance contracts.
Retroactive reinsurance
NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding
companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and
casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or
for losses payable immediately after the inception of the contract. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of
indemnification and are occasionally exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent
injury claims may arise under these contracts. For instance, in January 2017, NICO entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement
with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Under the agreement, NICO agreed to
indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion in excess of $25 billion retained by AIG, of losses and allocated loss adjustment
expenses with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring in years prior to 2016.
The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and
terms, since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected
to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large
amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results
in future periods.
 
K-5
 
Periodic payment annuity
BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these
policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These
policies, generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of other insurers, known as
structured settlements. Similar to retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in
establishing such premiums and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities.
Investments of insurance businesses—Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets.
Investment portfolios are managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and other in-house investment managers. Investments
include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed
maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts
to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much
greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry.
Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and
reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities
that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and
health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred
policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from
approximately $84 billion at the end of 2014 to approximately $129 billion at the end of 2019, primarily through internal growth.
The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. Over the past five years,
with the exception of 2017, Berkshire’s cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains.

Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF
Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 40,750 employees at
the end of 2019. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business.
In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States,
BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries.
Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company
quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the
international, national and regional levels.
BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern
United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many
smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing
agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending
December 31, 2019, approximately 35% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 27% from industrial products,
21% from agricultural products and 17% from coal.
Regulatory Matters
BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are
subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) the Federal Railroad Administration of the
United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as
other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction
over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line
extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB
proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.
The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent
of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas
not otherwise preempted by federal law.

Environmental Matters
BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
regulation covering discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and
disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail
operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other
hazardous materials.
Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to
commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular,
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and
severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the
original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental
costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF
operations.
Competition
The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated
motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The
presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage
continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could
further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF and other railroads seek to
develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.
As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF
Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I
railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF.

K-7
 
As vertically integrated utilities, BHE’s domestic utilities own approximately 29,000 net megawatts of generation capacity in
operation and under construction. The domestic utilities business is subject to seasonal variations principally related to the use of
electricity for air conditioning and natural gas for heating. Typically, regulated electric revenues are higher in the summer months,
while regulated natural gas revenues are higher in the winter months.
The Great Britain distribution companies consist of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Limited and Northern Powergrid
(Yorkshire) plc, which own a substantial electricity distribution network that delivers electricity to end-users in northeast England
in an area covering approximately 10,000 square miles. The distribution companies primarily charge supply companies regulated
tariffs for the use of their distribution systems.

and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, BHE Renewables has invested over $3 billion in twenty-one wind
projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments.
Regulatory Matters
PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local
agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement
provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC
regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the
expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention;
securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement
authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.3 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the
Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of
1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.
With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their
service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of
customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail
customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail
electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state
regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a
reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the
Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and
distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission and distribution-only services.
Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution
systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets
Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023.
K-8
 
AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the
Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The
AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad
authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under
the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta
Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of
those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system
(“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the
AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.
The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The natural gas pipeline and
storage operations of Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of
service and (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension,
expansion or abandonment of such facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered
by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency within the DOT.
Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which
establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.
Environmental Matters
BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change,
renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal,
hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and
future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean
Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and
other sanctions.
The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for
protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be
promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at
those facilities to comply with the requirements.
Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers
to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington,
California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal
clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact
electricity generators and natural gas providers.
In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for
coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of
limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius;
establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at
achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and
progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new
commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris
Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris
Agreement formally entered into force November 4, 2016. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced the United States would
begin the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, withdrawal cannot occur until
four years after entry into force, making the United States’ withdrawal effective in November 2020.
On October 10, 2017, the EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to achieve an overall
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19,
2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power
Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled
power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates.
Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. The EPA’s repeal and replacement of the
Clean Power Plan is not expected to have a material impact on BHE and its energy subsidiaries. Increasingly, states are adopting
legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing
amounts of clean and renewable energy.
K-9
 
BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers
and on actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, through December 31, 2019, BHE’s cumulative investment in
wind, solar, geothermal and biomass generation is approximately $29 billion.

for residential and commercial use under about 30 brand and trade names and under certain private labels. Shaw also provides
project management and installation services. Shaw’s manufacturing operations are fully integrated from the processing of raw
materials used to make fiber through the finishing of carpet. In 2018, Shaw acquired Sanquahar Tile Services in Scotland, which
manufactures and distributes carpet tile throughout Europe. Shaw also manufactures or distributes a variety of hardwood, vinyl and
laminate floor products (“hard surfaces”). In 2016, Shaw acquired USFloors, Inc., which is a leading innovator and marketer of

over 2,400 salaried and commissioned sales personnel directly to retailers and distributors and to large national accounts. Shaw’s
seven carpet, six hard surface, one sample full-service distribution facility and three sample satellite locations and thirty
redistribution centers, along with centralized management information systems, enable it to provide prompt and efficient delivery
of its products to both its retail customers and wholesale distributors.
Substantially all carpet manufactured by Shaw is tufted carpet made from nylon, polypropylene and polyester. In the tufting
process, yarn is inserted by multiple needles into a synthetic backing, forming loops, which may be cut or left uncut, depending on
the desired texture or construction. During 2019, Shaw processed approximately 95% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own
yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials continues to be adequate but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and
natural gas price changes. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers.
The floor covering industry is highly competitive with more than 100 companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of
carpet in the United States and numerous manufacturers engaged in hard surface floor covering production and sales. According to
industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 45% of the total United States consumption of all flooring types. The
principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality, style, price and service.

over 40 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and China and conducts research and development at its technical center
in Littleton, Colorado and at other facilities in the U.S. and Europe.
Fiberglass is made from earthen raw materials and recycled glass, together with proprietary agents to bind many of its glass
fibers. JM’s products also contain materials other than fiberglass, including various chemical and petro-chemical-based materials
used in roofing and other specialized products. JM uses recycled material when available and suitable to satisfy the broader needs
of its customers. The raw materials used in these various products are readily available in sufficient quantities from various sources
to maintain and expand its current production levels.

JM’s operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which regulate the
discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. The most relevant of
the federal laws are the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation

produced in Morocco. Manufacturing of bras, athletic equipment, sporting goods and other athletic apparel lines are generally
sourced from third-party contractors located primarily in Asia.
U.S. grown cotton and polyester fibers are the main raw materials used in the manufacturing of FOL’s apparel products and
are purchased from a limited number of third-party suppliers. In 2015, FOL entered into an eight-year agreement with one key
supplier to provide the majority of FOL’s yarn. Management currently believes there are readily available alternative sources of raw
materials and yarn. However, if relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources
of supply, production could be adversely affected, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on results of operations.
Additionally, raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic
climate and other unpredictable factors. FOL has secured contracts to purchase cotton, either directly or through the yarn suppliers,
to meet a large percentage of its production plans for 2020. FOL’s markets are highly competitive, consisting of many domestic and
foreign manufacturers and distributors. Competition is generally based upon product features, quality, customer service and price.

consumer products to consumers. Information regarding each of these operations follows. Berkshire’s retailing businesses employ
approximately 29,000 people.
Berkshire Hathaway Automotive
The Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Group, Inc. (“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States,
currently operating 106 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the
United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts,
vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party
lenders. BHA operates 29 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto
auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company.
Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 70% of dealership-
related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle
manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln,
Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these
manufacturers.
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership
groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via
the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume,
the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting
customers.
K-19
 
BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework
agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and the ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships.
Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing
those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer
that may be owned by BHA.
Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-
exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as
well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the
management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-
renewal for a variety of causes. The states generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection
to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or
with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law.
BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health
insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training
programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only
risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair
our business operations.
We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.
Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board
of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 89, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
age 96. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a
material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire
managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett and has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a
replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement
for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our
numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed
Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s
insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for
major capital allocation and investment decisions.
K-21
 
We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses.
In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of
our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory
environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving
their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and
personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a
whole.
Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value.
We concentrate a high percentage of the investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity
securities and diversify our investment portfolios far less than is conventional in the insurance industry. A significant decline in the
fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity
and our consolidated earnings.
Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair
values of these investments will produce significant declines in their statutory surplus. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive
advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to
write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits.
Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts,
which contain equity price risks. Most of the contracts remaining at year end 2019 will expire by February 2023. Risks of losses
under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major U.S. and international stock indexes.
We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity
securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that
equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in significant settlement payments upon contract expirations.
Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.
Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our
businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages,
many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our
future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive
advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline.
Deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to
access capital markets at a reasonable cost.
Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, which affect the general economy or the specific industries
in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse
effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business
regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures, and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital
markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these
operations could be adversely affected.
Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses.
A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business
operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities
and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses.
K-22
 
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues,
regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of
banks and other major financial institutions and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our
businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating
businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict
whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash
flows.
Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These
regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems,
networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties.
Cyber security risks
We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our
information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-
service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more
sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety
failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users
and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and
expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.
Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery
planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new
technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and/or liquidity.
Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or
compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage
to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost
revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security,
repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could
materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism,
sustained or significant cyber-attacks, or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these
risks with all businesses.
Risks unique to our regulated businesses
Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.
When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single
event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event
resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined
underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid
writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. Currently,
we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10 billion. However,
despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies
are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage,
negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may
result in lower reported earnings in a future period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
K-23
 
The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may
result in significant underwriting losses.
The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty
insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades
before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that
liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages
provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our
estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($115.5 billion at
December 31, 2019), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings.
Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital.
Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to
among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that
must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing
and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance
regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active
insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management.  Accordingly,
changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may
adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.
Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to
rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to
comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change
the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects
that the change may have on the business. For example, federal legislation, enacted in 2008 and amended in 2015, mandated the
implementation of positive train control technology by December 31, 2020, on certain mainline track where inter-city and
commuter passenger railroads operate and where toxic-by-inhalation (“TIH”) hazardous materials are transported. Complying with
legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital
expenditures.
BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To
the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or
alternate fuels, such as natural gas, displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a
common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport TIH chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials
could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of
the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to
its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign
governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to
new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly
apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including:
acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and
transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting
rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; transacting between our domestic utilities and our other
subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing
regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards,
emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal,
protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant
adverse impact on our financial results.
K-24
 
Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that
transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also
require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet
their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in
order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable
through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through
debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when
needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business,
including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts
issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal
and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its
subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and
penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with
Section 1503 (a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K.

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an
unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal
involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate
management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and
the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 27 to the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity
securities. These gains and losses have been very significant given the size of our holdings and the inherent volatility in securities
prices, producing extraordinary volatility in our reported net earnings for 2019 and 2018. Prior to 2018, the changes in unrealized
gains and losses pertaining to such investments were recorded in other comprehensive income. The new accounting treatment has
no effect on our consolidated shareholders’ equity.
Net earnings in 2017 included approximately $29.1 billion attributable to a one-time net benefit from the enactment of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) on December 22, 2017. This benefit included approximately $29.6 billion related to a
one-time non-cash reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities from the reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate
from 35% to 21%, and a net benefit of approximately $900 million primarily attributable to our earnings from Kraft Heinz, partly
offset by a one-time income tax expense of approximately $1.4 billion on the deemed repatriation of certain accumulated
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Due to the significance, we presented these one-time effects as a distinct item in the
preceding table. Accordingly, the after-tax figures presented for 2017 in the discussion of our various operating businesses and
other activities exclude the one-time effects of the TCJA.
After-tax earnings of our business operations in 2019 and 2018 were favorably affected by lower U.S. income tax expense
compared to 2017, primarily attributable to a reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The effect
of the lower U.S. statutory income tax rate on the comparative after-tax earnings of our various business operations varied,
reflecting the differences in the mix of earnings subject to income tax, income tax credits and the effects of state and local income
taxes.
Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $325 million in 2019 compared to earnings of
$1.6 billion in 2018 and after-tax losses of approximately $2.2 billion in 2017. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax
losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $800 million in 2019, $1.3 billion in 2018 and $1.95 billion in 2017.
Earnings from primary insurance operations were lower in 2019 and losses from reinsurance were higher than in 2018.  After-tax
underwriting earnings in 2019 included lower earnings from reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’
property/casualty loss events as compared to 2018 and losses of $92 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes on
certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included after-tax foreign currency
exchange rate gains of $207 million in 2018 and losses of $295 million in 2017.
After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2019 increased 21.4% over 2018, which increased 17.2% over 2017.
These increases reflected increases in interest and dividend income.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Results of Operations (Continued)
After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from
higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost
control initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions
and severe winter weather in the first half of the year. All key routes impacted by flooding resumed service by the third quarter. Our
railroad business generated a 31.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting an increase in unit volume,
higher average revenue per car/unit and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by increased fuel and other operating costs.
After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.4% in 2019 compared to 2018 as all businesses produced
higher earnings in 2019 versus 2018. Our utilities and energy businesses produced higher after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to
2017, primarily due to the effects of losses incurred in 2017 in connection with the prepayment of certain long-term debt, increased
earnings at the natural gas pipelines and other energy businesses and the TCJA income tax benefits recognized in 2018.
Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were relatively unchanged from 2018. Operating results of
our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were mixed, with several of these businesses experiencing lower
earnings in 2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively
affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions
and U.S. trade tariffs. After-tax earnings in 2018 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 29% over 2017,
due to lower effective income tax rates and a 13% increase in pre-tax earnings.
Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2019 and 2018 included significant unrealized gains and losses from market price
changes on our holdings of equity securities. After-tax unrealized gains on equity securities were approximately $53.7 billion in
2019 compared to after-tax losses of $20.6 billion in 2018. After-tax investment gains in 2019 also included after-tax realized gains
on sales of equity and fixed maturity securities of $2.6 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2018. We believe that investment and
derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are
generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains
and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.
After-tax other earnings included equity method investment earnings of $1.0 billion in 2019, losses of $1.4 billion in 2018
and earnings of $1.1 billion in 2017. The losses in 2018 were attributable to Kraft Heinz, partly offset by earnings from other equity
method investments. Other earnings also included foreign currency exchange rate gains of $58 million in 2019, $289 million in
2018, and losses of $655 million in 2017 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S. based
financing subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).  
Insurance—Underwriting
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.
Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s
Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of
underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as
a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or
unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods.
We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance operations.
The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,
particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million
from a current year event as significant. We incurred estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $1.0 billion in 2019, $1.6 billion in
2018 and $3.0 billion in 2017 from significant catastrophe events.
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior
years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive
reinsurance contracts, were approximately $115.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our periodic underwriting results may also
include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar
denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance
activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In
reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected
themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary
Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”).
Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

GEICO
GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the
company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss)  $ 1,506      $ 2,449      $ (310)   
 
 
2019 versus 2018
Premiums written and earned in 2019 increased 5.5% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were
primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.4% over the past twelve months, partially offset by a decrease
in average premiums per auto policy due to coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix.  The increase in voluntary auto
policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales of 10.9% and a decrease in the number of policies not
renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,068,000 during 2019.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 10.1% to $28.9 billion. GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses
ratio in 2019 was 81.3%, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2018. The loss ratio increase in 2019 reflected continuing
increases in loss severities, slightly offset by lower storm-related losses.
Claims frequencies in 2019 declined compared to 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (two to four percent
range) and personal injury protection coverage (one to two percent range) and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury
coverage. Average claims severities in 2019 were higher versus 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six
percent range) and bodily injury coverage (seven to nine percent range).
Losses and loss adjustment expenses regularly include changes in the ultimate claim loss estimates during the period for
prior years’ loss events, which produce pre-tax underwriting earnings or losses in the period of the change. GEICO increased
ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events by $42 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of $222 million in 2018.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
Underwriting expenses in 2019 were $5.1 billion, an increase of $493 million (10.6%) over 2018. GEICO’s underwriting
expense ratio in 2019 was 14.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was
primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases.
2018 versus 2017
Premiums written were $34.1 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.7% compared to 2017. The increase reflected voluntary auto
policies-in-force growth of 3.3% and increased premiums per auto policy of approximately 6.4%. The increase in premiums per
policy was attributable to rate increases, coverage changes and changes in state and risk mix. The rate increases were in response to
accelerating claim costs in previous years. Although policies-in-force increased 540,000 during 2018, the rate of increase slowed,
as voluntary auto new business sales decreased 4.7% compared to 2017.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2018 were $26.3 billion, an increase of $781 million (3.1%) compared to 2017.
GEICO’s losses and loss adjustment expenses ratio for 2018 was 78.8%, a decline of 7.8 percentage points compared to 2017.
Losses from significant catastrophe events were $105 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in
California) and approximately $450 million in 2017 (Hurricanes Harvey and Irma). GEICO reduced ultimate claim loss estimates
for prior years’ loss events by $222 million in 2018 and increased estimated prior year ultimate liabilities by $517 million in 2017.
Claims frequencies in 2018 for property damage, collision, and bodily and personal injury protection coverages declined
(two to four percent range) compared to 2017. Average claims severities in 2018 increased for property damage and collision
coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (five to seven percent range) versus 2017.
Underwriting expenses in 2018 were approximately $4.6 billion, an increase of $382 million (9.0%) over 2017. GEICO’s
underwriting expense ratio in 2018 was 13.9%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2017. The underwriting expense
increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses, insurance premium taxes and employee-related costs,
which reflected wage and staffing increases.
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group
The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including
healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small,
medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire
Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”),
and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company,
Applied Underwriters (sold in October 2019), Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company, acquired
October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
 
  2019   2018   2017

Premiums written in 2019 increased approximately $1.3 billion (15.0%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily
attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty (30%), GUARD (28%) and MedPro Group (14%) and from the effects of the
MLMIC acquisition, partially offset by the effects of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters and lower volume at BHHC. The
increases in premiums earned in 2019 reflected the overall volume increase over the past year.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued)
BH Primary produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $383 million in 2019 and $670 million in 2018. BH Primary’s
aggregate loss ratios were 69.1% in 2019 and 64.9% in 2018. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred included reductions for
prior years’ loss events of $499 million in 2019 and $715 million in 2018. The decrease in 2019 was primarily attributable to lower
than anticipated medical professional liability and workers’ compensation losses, partially offset by higher commercial auto and
other liability losses. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019 that affected BH Primary. Underwriting
results in 2018 included estimated losses from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California of approximately
$190 million.
Premiums written and earned in 2018 increased 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, compared to 2017. The increases were
primarily attributable to written premium growth at BH Specialty (33%), GUARD (19%), NICO Primary (14%) and BHHC (8%).
BH Primary’s loss ratios were 64.9% in 2018 and 63.1% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included losses from
significant catastrophe events of $190 million in 2018 from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California and
$225 million in 2017 from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net gains from
the reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $715 million in 2018 and $766 million in 2017. The
liability reductions in each year primarily related to healthcare malpractice and workers’ compensation business.
BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance
and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant
increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher than expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or
judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance
to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire
Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and
General Re Life Corporation (“General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance
contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN.
Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in
establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the
liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and
discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A
summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Property/casualty premiums written in 2019 of $10.4 billion represented an increase of 10.8% compared to 2018.   Premiums
earned in 2019 increased $983 million (11.0%) versus 2018. The increase in premiums written reflected overall growth in U.S. and
international markets. The growth was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations for
renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Property/casualty
premiums written in 2018 were $9.4 billion, an increase of 22.0% over 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to new
business and increased participations for renewal business in both property and casualty lines. Premiums earned included $1.7
billion in 2019 and $1.8 billion in both 2018 and 2017 from a 10-year, 20% quota-share contract with Insurance Australia Group
Limited, which expires in 2025.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses were $7.3 billion in 2019, $6.9 billion in 2018 and $7.2 billion in 2017 and losses and
loss adjustment expense ratios were 73.8% in 2019, 77.6% in 2018 and 95.6% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses
included incurred losses from significant catastrophe events occurring each year, including approximately $1.0 billion in 2019
($700 million in the fourth quarter), $1.3 billion in 2018 ($1.1 billion in the fourth quarter) and $2.4 billion in 2017. Losses in 2019
derived from Typhoons Faxia and Hagibis and wildfires in California and Australia.  Losses in 2018 derived from Hurricanes
Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and wildfires in California. Losses in 2017 derived from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria,
an earthquake in Mexico, a cyclone in Australia and wildfires in California.
Before the effects of significant catastrophe events, losses and loss adjustment expense ratios were 64% in 2019, 63% in
2018 and 64% in 2017. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included gains from net decreases in estimated ultimate claim
liabilities attributable to prior years’ loss events of approximately $295 million in 2019, $469 million in 2018 and $295 million in
2017. Such decreases as percentages of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 1.0%
in 2019, 1.7% in 2018 and 1.2% in 2017.

Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Life/health (Continued)
Life/health premiums earned were $4.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of $460 million (8.6%) compared to 2018. In the first
quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer. The amendment
effectively eliminated BHLN’s future exposures under the contract. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this
contract in 2019 of $49 million while premiums earned in 2018 related to this contract were $954 million. Life/health premiums
earned in 2019 also included $228 million from a single reinsurance contract covering health insurance risks. We also experienced
volume growth in several international life markets, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation
attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower U.S. life volumes.
The life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $326 million in 2019. Underwriting results for 2019
included a one-time pre-tax gain of $163 million attributable to the yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment.
Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to
higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions, increased U.S. long-term care liabilities due to discount
rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions, and an increase in life claims in North America, partially offset by
increased earnings from other international life business. Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax
earnings of $167 million in 2019. Underwriting results from this business reflect changes in estimated liabilities for guaranteed
benefits, which derive from changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit
margins.
Life/health premiums earned in 2018 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $535 million (11.1%) over 2017. The increase was
primarily attributable to growth in the North America, Asia and Australia life insurance markets. Our life/health business produced
pre-tax underwriting earnings of $216 million in 2018 and losses of $52 million in 2017. The underwriting earnings in 2018
reflected lower losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business, partially offset by lower earnings from the run-off of
variable annuity guarantee contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded pre-tax losses of $450 million from discount rate
reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions associated with long-term care liabilities. Pre-tax earnings from variable
annuity guarantee contracts were $34 million in 2018 and $256 million in 2017.
Retroactive reinsurance
Retroactive reinsurance premiums earned in 2019 and 2018 were $684 million and $517 million, respectively, and were
attributable to a limited number of contracts in each year. Premiums earned in 2017 included $10.2 billion from an aggregate
excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (the “AIG
Agreement”). At the inception of our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we record the estimated ultimate claim liabilities, and we
also record the excess of such claim liabilities over the premiums received as a deferred charge asset. Thus, as of the inception
dates of these contracts, there is no net underwriting gain or loss.
Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and
amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains/losses arising from the periodic remeasurement of
liabilities related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency
remeasurement produced pre-tax losses of $76 million in 2019, gains of $169 million in 2018 and losses of $264 million in 2017.
Retroactive reinsurance contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses of $1,189
million in 2019, $947 million in 2018 and $1,066 million in 2017. Losses included deferred charge amortization of $646 million in
2019, $611 million in 2018 and $527 million in 2017 related to the AIG Agreement. In 2019, we increased estimated ultimate
liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $378 million compared to a decrease of $341 million in 2018. After
adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim
payments, such changes produced pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $125 million in 2019 and earnings of $185 million
in 2018.  
Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $42.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and
$41.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $13.7 billion at
December 31, 2019 and $14.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected
remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization.

Periodic payment annuity
Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2019 were $863 million, a decrease of $293 million (25.3%) compared to
2018, while premiums earned in 2018 increased $258 million (28.7%) compared to 2017. Periodic payment annuity business is
price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the
perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments as well as the level of competition.
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount
accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality and interest rate changes and
remeasurement gains and losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S.
subsidiaries. Foreign currency remeasurement losses were $40 million in 2019 compared to gains of $93 million in 2018 and losses
of $190 million in 2017.
Excluding foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity
contracts were $509 million in 2019 compared to $433 million in 2018 and $481 million in 2017. These losses primarily derived
from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted
annuity liabilities were $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and at December 31, 2019, the
weighted average discount rate was approximately 4.1%.
Insurance—Investment Income
A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).
  2019   2018   2017  
Interest and other investment income  $ 2,075  $ 1,851  $ 1,263 
Dividend income   4,525   3,652   3,592 
Investment income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests   6,600   5,503   4,855 
Income taxes and noncontrolling interests   1,070   949   968 
Net investment income  $ 5,530  $ 4,554  $ 3,887 
Effective income tax rate   16.1%  17.2%  19.9%
 
Interest and other investment income in 2019 increased $224 million (12.1%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily
due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties, partially offset
by lower income earned from fixed maturity securities and limited partnership investments. Dividend income in 2019 increased
$873 million (23.9%) compared to 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment
levels over the past year, including the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% Cumulative Preferred Stock of Occidental
Petroleum Corporation on August 8, 2019, and higher dividend rates on common stock investments. We continue to hold large
balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. While short-term interest yields in the U.S. were higher in
the first half of 2019 compared to 2018, interest rates declined during the second half of the year. Accordingly, earnings from such
balances will likely be lower in 2020 than in 2019. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on
safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.
Pre-tax interest and other investment income in 2018 increased $588 million (46.6%) compared to 2017. The increase
reflected the effect of higher short-term interest rates in 2018 and higher other investment income, partly offset by lower interest
income as a result of lower average investments in fixed maturity securities. Dividend income increased $60 million (1.7%) in 2018
as compared to 2017, reflecting the impact of increased investments in marketable equity securities and higher dividend rates on
common stock holdings, partially offset by Restaurant Brands International’s redemption of our $3 billion investment in 9%
preferred stock in December 2017.
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net
liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit
liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, less insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables,
deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $129
billion at December 31, 2019, $123 billion at December 31, 2018 and $114 billion at December 31, 2017. Our combined insurance
operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $417 million in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, and
consequently, the average cost of float for each of those periods was negative. Pre-tax underwriting losses were approximately
$3.2 billion in 2017 and our average cost of float in 2017 was approximately 3.0%.

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”)
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with
approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major
business groups by type of product shipped. These business groups include consumer products, coal, industrial products and
agricultural products. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions).

2019 versus 2018
BNSF’s revenues were $23.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of $340 million (1.4%) versus 2018. During 2019, BNSF’s revenues
reflected a 3.6% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.5% decrease in volume. Volume was 10.2 million
cars/units compared to 10.7 million in 2018. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per
car/unit and a favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing. Pre-tax earnings in 2019 were approximately $7.3 billion, an increase of
5.6% over 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected
revenues, expenses and service levels. In addition to the impact of an increase in average revenue per car/unit, BNSF's earnings in
2019 benefitted from a reduction in total operating expenses.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued)
Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting higher
average revenue per car/unit and volume decreases of 4.6%. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the
availability of truck capacity, as well as lower west coast imports.
Revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was attributable to
higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 3.0%. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall
softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes, and reduced car loadings due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019.
Strength in the energy sector, which drove higher demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the
decreases in volumes.
Revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was due to
lower volumes of 5.1% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition
from non-U.S. sources, the impacts of international trade policies, and the challenging weather conditions in 2019.
Revenues from coal decreased 7.4% in 2019 to $3.7 billion compared to 2018. This decrease reflected lower average revenue
per car/unit and lower volumes of 5.3%. Volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, as well as from the
effects of lower natural gas prices.
Operating expenses were $15.2 billion in 2019, a decrease of $756 million (4.7%) compared to 2018. Our ratio of operating
expenses to revenues decreased 2.3 percentage points to 64.6% in 2019 versus 2018. BNSF's expenses in 2019 reflected lower
volume-related costs, lower fuel prices, the effects of cost control initiatives, and a retirement plan curtailment gain, partially offset
by the costs associated with the adverse weather conditions.
Fuel expenses decreased $402 million (12.0%) compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes,
and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense decreased $170 million (5.9%) compared to 2018. The decrease was due
to lower purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, lower drayage, lower services expense, and higher
insurance recoveries. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $223 million (11.0%) compared to 2018. The
decrease was primarily due to a $120 million curtailment gain from the amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit
retirement plans, as well as from lower locomotive and various other costs associated with lower volumes and cost controls.
BNSF’s effective income tax rate was 24.4% in 2019, 24.0% in 2018 and 37.4% in 2017. The rate in 2017 excluded the
effects of the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. statutory income tax rate.
2018 versus 2017
BNSF’s revenues were $23.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.5 billion (11.5%) over 2017. BNSF’s revenues in 2018
reflected a 6.2% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.1% increase in volume. Combined volume was
10.7 million cars/units compared to 10.3 million in 2017. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased
rates per car/unit, higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, and business mix changes. Pre-tax earnings were
approximately $6.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.5% compared to 2017.
Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 11.1% compared to 2017, reflecting higher
average revenue per car/unit and volume increases of 2.9%. The volume increases were due to higher domestic intermodal
volumes, as well as growth in imports and containerized agricultural product exports, partially offset by a sizable contract loss.
Revenues from industrial products were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 16.2% from 2017. The increase was attributable
to volume increases of 9.8% as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. Volumes in 2018 increased for petroleum products,
building products, construction products, and plastics.
Revenues from agricultural products increased 8.8% in 2018 to $4.7 billion compared to 2017. The increase was due to
higher volumes of 9.0%, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased due to strong export and
domestic corn shipments, as well as higher fertilizer and other grain products volumes, partially offset by a reduction in soybean
and wheat exports.
Revenues from coal in 2018 increased 4.3% to $4.0 billion compared to 2017, attributable to higher average revenue per
car/unit, partially offset by lower volumes of 0.8%. The volume decrease in 2018 was due mainly to utility plant retirements
combined with competition from natural gas and renewables, mostly offset by market share gains and increased export volumes.

Total operating expenses were $16.0 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.9 billion (13.6%) compared to 2017. Our ratio of
operating expenses to revenues increased 1.2 percentage points to 66.9% in 2018 versus 2017. Compensation and benefits expenses
increased $371 million (7.4%) compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to wage inflation and increased headcount and
associated training costs. Fuel expenses increased $828 million (32.9%) compared to 2017 primarily due to higher average fuel
prices and increased volumes. Purchased services expense increased $356 million (14.2%) compared to 2017, due to higher
purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, as well as increased intermodal ramping, drayage, and other
volume-related costs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense increased $388 million (23.7%) compared to 2017, reflecting
higher locomotive material expenses, personal injury expenses, derailment-related costs, and property taxes, as well as the impact
of a benefit in 2017 from the enactment of the TCJA on an equity method investee.
Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”)
We currently own 90.9% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which
operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy
Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses
referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE also owns two domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline companies. Other energy
businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified
portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and
one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States.
The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business
operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these regulated
operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. The TCJA
reduced the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, BHE’s regulated subsidiaries began passing the
benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including
lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

PacifiCorp
PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming.
Net earnings after income taxes were $773 million in 2019, an increase of $34 million (4.6%) compared to 2018, reflecting slightly
higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher other income, partly offset by higher depreciation expense
from additional plant-in-service. Utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $4 million compared to 2018, as higher
retail revenue from a 0.4% increase in retail customer volumes, in part due to the favorable impact of weather, was largely offset by
lower wholesale revenue mainly due to lower volumes.
Net earnings after income taxes decreased $24 million (3.1%) in 2018 as compared to 2017. The change in after-tax earnings
reflected the unfavorable utility margin and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher other income. Utility margin in 2018
was $3.3 billion, a decrease of $198 million (6%) versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $197 million decline in retail
revenues from the effects of lower average rates of $180 million (including the impact of the TCJA of $152 million) and a
reduction in volumes (0.2%), largely attributable to the impacts of weather.
MidAmerican Energy Company
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Net earnings after income taxes of
$781 million in 2019 increased $112 million (16.7%) as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increases in electric utility
margin, income tax benefits from higher production tax credits and the effects of ratemaking, and other income. Electric utility
margin in 2019 increased 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes of 1.4%,
as an increase in industrial volumes of 4.0% was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impact of
weather. These earnings increases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service
(net of lower Iowa revenue sharing) and higher net interest expense.
Net earnings after income taxes were $669 million in 2018, an increase of $72 million (12.1%) compared to 2017, reflecting
higher electric utility margin, higher depreciation and operating expenses and higher income tax benefits, partly due to higher
production tax credits. Electric utility margin was $1.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $122 million (7%) compared to 2017, which
was primarily due to higher retail revenues of $102 million, reflecting higher recoveries through bill riders and volumes, partially
offset by lower rates, predominantly from the impact of the TCJA. The increase in depreciation expense included $65 million from
additional wind generation and other plant placed in-service and $44 million from Iowa revenue sharing.
NV Energy
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Net earnings after income taxes were $365 million
in 2019, an increase of $48 million (15.1%) compared to 2018, as lower operating expenses were partly offset by lower electric
utility margin. Electric utility margin in 2019 was $1.6 billion, representing a decrease of $58 million (3%) versus 2018. The
decrease was primarily due to a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes, largely attributable to the impacts of weather, and rate
reductions from the impact of the TCJA, partially offset by retail customer growth.
Net earnings after income taxes decreased $48 million (13.2%) in 2018 as compared to 2017, reflecting lower electric utility
margin and increased depreciation and operating expenses. Electric utility margin decreased $52 million in 2018 as compared to
2017 due to the effects of the TCJA, partially offset by higher retail sales volumes.

Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued)
Northern Powergrid
Net earnings after income taxes increased 7.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting higher distribution revenues and lower
operating expenses, which were largely from lower pension settlement losses in 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign
currency translation effects of a strong average U.S. Dollar ($10 million). Distribution revenues increased $18 million, attributable
to higher tariff rates, partly offset by lower distributed units.
Net earnings after income taxes were $239 million in 2018, a decrease of $12 million (4.8%) compared to 2017, reflecting
higher distribution revenues, increased depreciation and operating expenses, including higher pension settlement losses, and a $9
million increase from the effects of a weaker U.S. Dollar.
Natural gas pipelines
Net earnings after income taxes increased $35 million (9.0%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher
transportation revenues from generally higher volumes and rates, favorable margins from system balancing activities and a
decrease in operating expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased spending on capital projects.
Net earnings after income taxes were $387 million in 2018, a 43.3% increase ($117 million) compared to 2017, reflecting
higher transportation revenues from higher volumes and rates due to unique market opportunities and colder average temperatures,
lower depreciation expense and a comparative increase in operating expenses.
Other energy businesses
Net earnings after income taxes in 2019 were $608 million, an increase of $119 million (24.3%) compared to 2018. The
increase was primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind energy projects ($49 million from tax equity investments
and $25 million from new and existing projects and activities), higher after-tax income from geothermal and natural gas units of
$53 million, largely due to higher generation and favorable margins and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower earnings
at a hydroelectric facility in the Philippines due to lower rainfall. The increase in earnings also reflected the effects of favorable
regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink L.P.
Net earnings after income taxes increased $85 million (21.0%) in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting increased revenues from
existing renewable energy projects from overall higher generation and pricing, increased earnings from wind tax equity investments
of $34 million and earnings from additional wind and solar capacity placed in-service, partially offset by higher operating expenses
at existing projects.
Real estate brokerage
Net earnings after income taxes increased 10.3% in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher after-
tax earnings at existing mortgage businesses due to increased refinance activity and earnings attributable to recent business
acquisitions, partially offset by lower after-tax earnings at existing brokerage businesses, primarily from lower units and margins.
Net earnings after income taxes were $145 million in 2018, an increase of $27 million (22.9%) compared to 2017. The
increase reflected earnings from acquired businesses, higher comparative operating expenses and lower margins at existing
businesses and lower income tax expense due to the impact of the TCJA.
Corporate interest and other
Net earnings after income taxes decreased $155 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to income tax benefits
recognized in 2018 related to the reduction of accrued repatriation taxes on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the
TCJA, higher corporate interest and lower after-tax earnings from non-regulated energy services.
Net earnings after income taxes increased $373 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an after-tax charge of
$246 million recognized in 2017 from a tender offer completed in December 2017 to redeem certain long-term debt of BHE and the
TCJA income tax benefits recognized in 2018.

Industrial products
2019 versus 2018
Revenues of the industrial products group were $30.6 billion in 2019, a slight decrease from 2018. Pre-tax earnings of the
group were $5.6 billion in 2019 compared to $5.8 billion in 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were
18.4% in 2019 compared to 19.0% in 2018.
PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. PCC experienced increased
sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets compared to 2018. The increase in
aerospace sales was tempered due to significant efforts focused on the ramp-up requirements for certain new aerospace programs,
such as LEAP, that created manufacturing inefficiencies and slowed production cycles contributing to delays in product deliveries
and sales. While we expect that Boeing’s decision to suspend production of its 737 MAX aircraft may reduce demand for certain of
our aerospace products in 2020, we also anticipate a significant portion of this volume reduction will be offset by incremental
volume for other programs. We are also seeing stabilization in demand for our industrial gas turbine products within the power
markets after two years of declines.  
PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected increased sales of
aerospace products and higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which was partially offset by lower earnings
from the power markets due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press
outages also negatively impacted earnings in 2018. PCC continues to incur incremental costs to meet required deliveries to
customers associated with the increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production
headwinds experienced were primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for
newer, complex aerospace products. PCC implemented certain measures and intends to implement additional measures to address
these issues and improve manufacturing efficiencies.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of $354 million (5.2%) compared to 2018. The decline reflected
lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices which were
necessitated by raw material cost increases in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. A fire at Lubrizol’s Rouen, France manufacturing,
blending and storage facility on September 26, 2019 resulted in the suspension of operations, which contributed significantly to the
decline in Additives volumes. Those operations partially restarted in December 2019. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in 2019
declined 4% from 2018, primarily due to volume decline of 6% in the Additives product lines.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year decreased 50.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to
the same periods in 2018. Earnings in 2019 were significantly impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire.
Lubrizol’s operating results in 2019 were also negatively affected by lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing expenses and
unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by improved material margins.
Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase
reflected the effects of business acquisitions over the past year, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely
offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and the impact of
lower metal prices in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition
of the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane
Services sectors benefitted from higher railcar equipment sales, railcar fleet utilization, railcar repair services, intermodal container
leasing revenue and improved crane rental demand in the U.S. and Australia.  
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 increased $12 million (1.0%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected the
effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by lower gains from business divestitures. Earnings in 2019 also reflected increased
earnings in several sectors that experienced sales volume increases, which were substantially offset by lower earnings in the Metal
Services and certain other sectors, the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and increased interest and other
expenses.
IMC’s revenues in 2019 declined 1.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation
effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower sales in several regions, including Asia and Europe, mostly offset by increased revenues
from recent business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.8% in 2019 versus 2018, attributable to unfavorable foreign
currency translation effects, changes in business mix to lower margin items and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Industrial products (Continued)
CTB’s revenues decreased 1.5% in 2019 versus 2018. The comparative decline was primarily due to unfavorable foreign
currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower revenues from grain and protein equipment, partly offset by higher
revenues from processing systems. CTB’s pre-tax earnings increased 11.7% in 2019 as compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019
benefitted from a combination of favorable changes in business mix, the moderation of cost increases of certain raw materials and
better pricing efficiency.
2018 versus 2017
Revenues from industrial products businesses were approximately $30.7 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately
$2.1 billion (7.4%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings of the industrial products group were approximately $5.8 billion in 2018, an
increase of $757 million (14.9%) compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 19.0% in 2018 and 17.7%
in 2017. The comparative earnings increase was partially attributable to certain one-time charges at PCC and Lubrizol in 2017.
PCC’s revenues in 2018 were $10.2 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to 2017, which reflected increased demand in
aerospace markets in connection with new aircraft programs, partly offset by lower demand for industrial gas turbine products. In
addition, PCC experienced lower sales of certain pipe products in 2018, primarily attributable to the U.S tariffs.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 16.0% in 2018 compared to 2017. PCC’s earnings in 2017 included certain one-time
inventory and impairment charges of $272 million. Results in 2018 were negatively affected by costs associated with the temporary
unplanned shut-down of certain metals facilities, metal press outages and lower earnings from the industrial gas turbine business.
The facilities that were shut-down gradually resumed production and were approximately 80% operational at the end of 2018. In
addition, the new aircraft programs involve relatively complex manufacturing processes, negatively affecting earnings.
Lubrizol’s revenues in 2018 were $6.8 billion, an increase of 5.9% compared to 2017 due to higher average sales prices,
favorable changes in product mix and foreign currency translation effects, and a 2% increase in aggregate unit volumes. Lubrizol
experienced significant increases in average material unit costs during 2018 and 2017, necessitating increases in sales prices.
Lubrizol’s consolidated volume included increases in the Advanced Materials (5%) and the Additives (1%) product lines.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 increased 43.5% compared to 2017, which included pre-tax losses of approximately
$190 million related to Lubrizol’s disposition of an underperforming bolt-on business and related intangible asset impairments and
restructuring charges. Before such charges, Lubrizol’s earnings increased 17%, reflecting the previously mentioned increases in
sales volumes and selling prices, as well as lower other restructuring charges, lower net interest expense, and the favorable effects
of foreign currency translation and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw material costs.
Marmon’s revenues in 2018 were $8.2 billion, an increase of 5.5% as compared to 2017. The revenue increase was primarily
attributable to volume increases in the Transportation Products sector, higher average metals prices, and the effects of business
acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by revenue decreases in the Beverage Technologies and Rail Products and
Services sectors. Rail Products and Services sector revenues also decreased due to lower railcar lease revenues, partly offset by
increased railcar equipment sales and repair services. Throughout 2018, the railcar leasing business experienced the negative effects
of lower lease renewal rates for railcars versus the rates on expiring leases.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 decreased 5.6% compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax
earnings from the Rail Products and Services sector ($126 million) and the Foodservice Technologies and Retail Solutions sectors
($33 million), partially offset by increased earnings from the Transportation Products sector and a gain in 2018 from the sale of
certain assets of the Beverage Technologies sector of $44 million. The Rail Products and Services earnings decline was attributable
to lower railcar leasing revenues and higher lease fleet repair costs.
IMC’s revenues increased 16.1% in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a combination of factors, including higher unit sales, the
effects of business acquisitions, and foreign currency translation effects from a weaker average U.S. Dollar in the first half of 2018.
IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a combination of higher sales, increased
manufacturing efficiencies, the effects of business acquisitions and ongoing expense control efforts, partly offset by higher raw
material costs.
CTB’s revenues increased 4.0% in 2018 versus 2017, due to favorable foreign currency translation effects and modest sales
growth in protein production and processing systems. CTB’s pre-tax earnings in 2018 were lower than 2017, primarily due to lower
gross sales margins attributable to raw material cost increases and higher other operating expenses.

Building products
2019 versus 2018
Revenues of the building products group were $20.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.65 billion (8.8%) compared to 2018.
Pre-tax earnings of the group were $2.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 12.8% over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of
revenues were 13.0% and 12.5% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The
comparative increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.16 billion (26%), reflecting a net increase in units sold and
changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 84% in 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while
average prices declined 5%. Manufactured home unit sales increased 5% and wholesale sales were 9% lower in 2019. Interest
income from lending activities in 2019 increased 6.7% compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average
outstanding loan balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 compared
to $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2018.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $182 million (20.0%) compared to 2018. The
earnings increase in 2019 was attributable to home building activities, which reflected the increases in home sales, and
manufactured housing lending activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities in 2019 increased 12%, primarily due
to an increase in interest income attributable to higher average loan balances, increased other financial services earnings and lower
credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher
other operating costs.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $13.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% versus 2018.
Revenues increased for paint and coatings, hard surface flooring and roofing products, attributable to a combination of increased
volumes, product mix changes and increased average selling prices, while sales of brick products declined, primarily attributable to
lower volumes.
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $1.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.2% over 2018.
Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material
costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities
closure costs.
2018 versus 2017
Revenues of the building products group in 2018 were approximately $18.7 billion, an increase of 10.2% compared to 2017.
Pre-tax earnings of the building products group were approximately $2.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.8% versus 2017. Overall,
pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2018 and 12.7% in 2017.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were $6.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 20.7% over 2017. The increase was driven by an increase
in revenues from home sales of $971 million (28.2%), primarily due to a 105% increase in unit sales of site-built homes attributable
to businesses acquired over the last two years. Unit sales of manufactured homes in 2018 also increased 4.9% compared to 2017.
Average unit prices of site-built homes are considerably higher than traditional manufactured homes. In addition, interest income
from lending activities increased 4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased average outstanding loan balances.
Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings were $911 million in 2018, an increase of $145 million (19.0%) compared to 2017. The
increase was primarily attributable to a significant increase in earnings from home building (manufactured housing and site-built
homes) activities, which reflected the impact of increased home sales and margins. Pre-tax earnings from lending activities in 2018
declined 2% compared to 2017, as increased interest expense, attributable to higher average debt balances and interest rates, and
higher operating costs more than offset the increase in interest income. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, aggregate loan balances
outstanding were approximately $14.7 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively.
Revenues of our other building products businesses increased 5.8% in 2018 to approximately $12.6 billion compared to
2017. In 2018, Shaw’s sales increased 7.9% and Johns Manville’s sales increased 7.2% as compared to 2017. The increases
reflected higher average selling prices, product mix changes and overall unit volume increases.

Building products (Continued)
Raw material and production costs in 2018 of our building products businesses were generally higher than in 2017. For
instance, steel, titanium dioxide and petrochemicals costs were substantially higher in 2018 than in 2017, as were product delivery
costs, due in part to the shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. These cost increases precipitated sales price increases, although such
increases lagged the increases in raw materials costs.
Consumer products
2019 versus 2018
Consumer products revenues were $11.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of $718 million (5.7%) versus 2018. Revenues of Forest
River declined 12.9% versus 2018, primarily due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 1.3% and apparel and
footwear revenues declined 1.1% compared to 2018. Despite a comparative revenue increase of 3.5% in 2019, Brooks Sports
operating results were negatively affected by lost sales associated with problems encountered at a distribution center that opened in
the second quarter. In addition, our other apparel and other footwear businesses continue to experience lower sales volumes for
certain products, reflecting the shift by major retailers towards private label products.
Consumer products pre-tax earnings were $1.25 billion in 2019, an increase of 3.6% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a
percentage of revenues were 10.6% in 2019 and 9.6% in 2018. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to
continuing cost containment efforts across several of the businesses and the effects of a new Duracell product launch, partially
offset by the impact of lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River.
2018 versus 2017
Consumer products revenues were approximately $12.5 billion in 2018, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2017, which was
primarily due to revenue increases at Forest River and at our apparel and footwear businesses. Forest River’s revenues increased
2.6% in 2018, reflecting relatively unchanged unit sales versus 2017. However, over the second half of the year, comparative sales
at Forest River declined 5%, reflecting a 7% decline in units sold. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 4.6% to approximately
$4.3 billion, primarily due to increased sales volume at Brooks Sports and Garan.
Pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion in 2018, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2017. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of
revenues were 9.6% in 2018 and 9.2% in 2017. The increase in earnings reflected increases from Duracell and the apparel and
footwear businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Larson Juhl.
Forest River’s pre-tax earnings declined 9.0% compared to 2017. Operating results were adversely affected over the second
half of 2018, and in the fourth quarter in particular, by higher material costs, which, together with the effects of lower sales
volumes, contributed to a 28% reduction in fourth quarter pre-tax earnings.
Pre-tax earnings of the apparel and footwear businesses increased 6.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily attributable to
the overall increase in revenues and sales mix changes. Duracell’s pre-tax earnings increased in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting
the favorable effects of ongoing operational improvement efforts and a comparative decline in restructuring charges.

Service
Our service business group offers fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology
training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise
and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Other service businesses include transportation equipment
leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire),
publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in
Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries
(Charter Brokerage).
2019 versus 2018
Service group revenues were $13.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.2% compared to 2018. Sales of TTI increased 2% in
2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency, TTI’s
sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. TTI’s sales began to slow in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continued to slow
throughout 2019, attributable to softening customer demand, lower sales prices and the effects of U.S. trade tariffs.
Service group revenues in 2019 also reflected increases in aviation-related services (NetJets and to a lesser extent
FlightSafety) and the leasing businesses, and decreases from the media businesses and Charter Brokerage, which divested a high
revenue, low margin business in mid-2019. The increase in NetJets revenues in 2019 reflected increased lease revenue, primarily
attributable to an increase in aircraft on lease and increased flight hours, partly offset by lower revenue from prepaid flight cards.
Pre-tax earnings of the service group were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of $155 million (8.4%) compared to 2018. Pre-tax
earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 12.5% in 2019 compared to 13.8% in 2018. The comparative declines in
earnings in 2019 were primarily due to lower earnings from TTI and FlightSafety, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets.
TTI’s earnings decline was attributable to lower gross margin, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating
expenses, partly offset by earnings from businesses acquired. FlightSafety’s earnings decline was attributable to significant losses
related to an existing government contract that were recorded in the fourth quarter, partly offset by lower training equipment
impairment charges. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved fleet and
operating efficiencies, which improved operating margins.
2018 versus 2017
Revenues of the service group were approximately $13.3 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately 9.7% compared to
2017. TTI’s revenues increased approximately 33.7% compared to 2017, reflecting industry-wide increases in demand for
electronic components in many geographic markets around the world, the effects of recent business acquisitions and favorable
foreign currency translation effects. While TTI’s revenue increase in 2018 was significant, revenue growth began to moderate in the
fourth quarter, in part attributable to the impact of U.S. trade tariffs. WPLG generated a revenue increase of 20.8% in 2018 over
2017, primarily due to increased political advertising revenue. Revenues of Charter Brokerage increased 53.3%, reflecting
increased fees earned and product mix changes. Revenues of the CORT and XTRA leasing businesses increased 8.4% in 2018
compared to 2017 due to increased over-the road trailer units on lease and increased furniture rental income.
Pre-tax earnings of the service group in 2018 were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 20.9% compared to 2017. The
comparative earnings increase was primarily due to TTI, which accounted for almost 84% of the increase. The earnings increase of
TTI was primarily due to the effects of the sales volume increases. In addition, XTRA, Charter Brokerage and NetJets each
generated increased earnings in 2018 compared to 2017. The increases in earnings of these businesses were partly offset by lower
earnings at FlightSafety, primarily due to reduced margins from sales of flight simulators and training equipment impairment
charges.
Retailing
Our retailers include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”). BHA includes over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and
pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto
auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings
retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring
and electronics.

Retailing (Continued)
Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies
(confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies
and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories.
2019 versus 2018
Retailing group revenues were $16.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.5% compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues in 2019, which
represented approximately 64% of our retailing revenues, increased 4.1% over 2018. BHA’s revenue increase reflected an 11.5%
increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, vehicle pricing increases, improvement in vehicle finance and service contract activities and
vehicle repair work as compared to 2018. New vehicle sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018.
Home furnishings group revenues, which represented about 20% of the aggregate retailing group revenues, declined 1.3% in
2019 compared to 2018. Sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations.
Retail group pre-tax earnings were $874 million in 2019, an increase of 1.6% over 2018. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased
22.7%, primarily due to the increases in earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan
interest expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings declined 14.7% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and
generally higher operating expenses. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined 7.9% compared
to 2018.  
2018 versus 2017
Revenues of the retailing group were approximately $15.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 3.6% compared to 2017. BHA’s
revenues, which represented approximately 63% of the aggregate retailing revenues, increased 4.0% as compared to 2017. The
increase derived primarily from increased pre-owned vehicle sales and service contract revenues. Revenues from new vehicle sales
were relatively unchanged. Louis revenues increased 7.8% in 2018 versus 2017, primarily due to the translation effects of a weaker
average U.S. Dollar. Home furnishings revenues increased 4.7% in 2018 over 2017, reflecting increased sales in certain geographic
markets and the effect of a new store.
Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group were $860 million in 2018, an increase of 9.6% over 2017. The earnings increase
included higher earnings from BHA and Louis, partly offset by lower earnings from the home furnishings retailers. The earnings
increase of BHA was primarily from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. The
earnings increase at Louis reflected the revenue increase and an increase in its operating margin rate. Earnings of the home
furnishings businesses declined 2.4% in 2018 compared to 2017, partly due to increased inventory liquidation, delivery and
occupancy costs at Star Furniture.
McLane Company
McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and
convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors
of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit
margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales
comprised approximately 66% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2019 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A
curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings.
Revenues were $50.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 0.9% compared to 2018. McLane operates on 52/53-week fiscal year
and 2019 included an extra week compared to 2018. Otherwise, revenues in 2019 decreased roughly 3% in the grocery business
and increased 3% in the foodservice business as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $42 million (17.1%) as compared to
2018. The earnings increase in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset
by increased operating expenses, the largest portion of which were employee costs. McLane continues to operate in an intensely
competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. We expect these operating conditions
will continue.

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
McLane Company (Continued)
Revenues were approximately $50.0 billion in 2018, slightly higher than 2017, reflecting a slight increase in grocery sales
(1%) and a slight decrease in foodservice sales (1%). The decline in foodservice revenues was primarily due to a net loss of
customers. Pre-tax earnings were $246 million, a decline of 17.7%, compared to 2017. McLane’s grocery and foodservice
businesses continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment, which negatively affected operating results. While
gross margin rates increased slightly over 2018, increases in fuel, depreciation and certain other operating expenses more than
offset the increase, producing a decline in pre-tax earnings compared to 2017.
Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses)

Investment gains (losses)
Due to a new accounting pronouncement adopted as of January 1, 2018, pre-tax investment gains/losses reported in earnings
include unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices on investments in equity securities. Prior to 2018,
investment gains/losses related to equity securities were generally recorded as the securities were sold, redeemed or exchanged
based on the cost of the disposed securities and the unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income.
While the new accounting pronouncement does not affect our consolidated shareholders’ equity or total comprehensive income, it
has significantly increased the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the
inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Investment gains and losses from periodic changes in securities prices will continue to
cause significant volatility in our consolidated earnings.
Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to equity
securities we held at December 31, 2019. By comparison, we recorded pre-tax investment losses of approximately $22.7 billion in
2018 attributable to unrealized losses with respect to the equity securities we held at December 31, 2018. Pre-tax net unrealized
gains on equity securities of approximately $29 billion in 2017 was recorded in other comprehensive income.
Prior to 2018, investment gains/losses on equity securities were recorded when securities were sold based on the cost of the
disposed securities. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold during the year, which is the difference between sales
proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018.
We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often
meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We
continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in
any given period has little analytical or predictive value.
Derivative gains (losses)
Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which
relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The
periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility
of underlying equity markets.
As of December 31, 2019, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $397 million and our recorded
liability at fair value was $968 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the
contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. Contracts with an aggregate notional value of
$12.3 billion expired in 2019.

Derivative gains (losses) (Continued)
Pre-tax gains from equity index put option contracts were $1.5 billion in 2019 compared to pre-tax losses of $300 million in
2018 and gains of $718 million in 2017. The gains in 2019 and 2017 reflected increases in the equity index values and shorter
remaining contract durations while the losses in 2018 were primarily due to lower equity index values.

After-tax equity method earnings include Berkshire’s share of earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and
Electric Transmission of Texas. After-tax equity method earnings related to our Kraft Heinz investment were earnings of
$488 million in 2019, losses of $1,859 million in 2018 and earnings of $972 million in 2017. The after-tax equity method losses in
2018 included approximately $2.7 billion for our share of intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz.
After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in
connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment
of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions.
Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion
par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥430 billion par), issued in September 2019, and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound
denominated debt (£1.75 billion par), issued in June 2019. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced non-cash
unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any
given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The income tax expense adjustment relates to investments that were made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity
investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018 and during the first
quarter of 2019, we learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent conduct by the sponsor of these funds and in January
2020 the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments.
As a result, we now believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized in prior years are not
valid.
Financial Condition
Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’
equity at December 31, 2019 was $424.8 billion, an increase of $76.1 billion since December 31, 2018. Net earnings attributable to
Berkshire shareholders in 2019 were $81.4 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $56.3 billion,
which were primarily from increases in market prices of the equity securities we owned at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2019, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $125.0
billion, which included $101 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our
investment in Kraft Heinz) were $266.7 billion. In August 2019, we paid $10 billion to acquire preferred stock and warrants of
Occidental Petroleum Corporation, as discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Financial Condition (Continued)
Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 was $19.9 billion, an increase of $3.0 billion since
December 31, 2018. In 2019, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of $750 million and issued ¥430 billion of senior notes
(approximately $4.0 billion), which has a weighted average interest rate of 0.49% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2049. In
March 2020, Berkshire Euro debt of €1.0 billion will mature.
Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $17.7 billion at December 31, 2019, which included
senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $11.0 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are
used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our UTLX railcar
leasing business. In 2019, BHFC repaid $3.95 billion of maturing senior notes and issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in
2049, £1.0 billion of 2.375% senior notes due in 2039 and £750 million of 2.625% senior notes due in 2059. Berkshire guarantees
the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In 2020, BHFC debt of $900 million
matures, including $350 million that matured in January.
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets
(property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital
expenditures of these two operations in 2019 were $11.0 billion and we forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately
$10.6 billion in 2020.
BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, relatively unchanged since December 31, 2018. In
2019, BNSF issued $825 million of 3.55% senior unsecured debentures due in 2050 and repaid $750 million of maturing
debentures. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $42.6 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of
$3.3 billion since December 31, 2018. In 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued debt aggregating $4.6 billion with maturity dates
ranging from 2029 to 2059 and repaid approximately $1.8 billion of maturing term debt. The proceeds from these financings were
used to repay borrowings, fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. In January 2020, a BHE subsidiary
issued $725 million of term debt consisting of $425 million of 2.4% notes due in 2030 and $300 million of 3.125% notes due in
2050. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed
to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program was amended on July 17, 2018, permitting Berkshire to repurchase its
Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share
repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to
be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of
Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and
redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In 2019, Berkshire repurchased shares of Class A and B
common stock for an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion.
Contractual Obligations
We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to
counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which
require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the
acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the financial
statements, will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Beginning in 2019, operating
lease obligations are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement.
The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon
the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Critical Accounting Policies
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of
uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based
on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that
required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2019 follows.
Property and casualty losses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim
liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The
timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds
and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of
techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions.
As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet
reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the
“claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-
tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract
interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.
Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were approximately $115.5 billion (including liabilities from
retroactive reinsurance), of which 84% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information
regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of these businesses follows.
GEICO
GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2019, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses
were $22.0 billion. Claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable were $20.9 billion.
GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions
affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”).
We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.
Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal
injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of
December 31, 2019, case development liabilities averaged approximately 30% of the case reserves. We select case development
factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.
K-55
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected
(reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the
ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims.
We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR
liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.
We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models
and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period
and projects the ultimate cost.
Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2018 increased $42 million during 2019, which produced a corresponding
decrease to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2019 reflect the most recent frequency
and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or
less than anticipated.
With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least
one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2019. We estimate that a one
percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $295 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities,
with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to
differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued
through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other
than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).
 
  Property   Casualty   Total  
Reported case liabilities  $ 5,063  $ 9,665  $ 14,728

Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  $ 9,426  $ 21,638  $ 31,064
 
 
Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the table above consist primarily of traditional property and casualty
coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple
lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we
allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.
In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information
received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract
terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.
The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess
contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information
is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive
through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid
losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally
required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S.,
reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of
the annual period. Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further delay the reporting
of claims. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual
reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons.
As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a
risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal
procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms.  Generally, our
reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus
providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning
whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If
disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no
coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.
Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients.  We
generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if
appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2019, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding
company estimates by approximately $2.0 billion for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We
also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.
Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of
actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data,
and other benchmarks as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and
management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices,
inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of
the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:
Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development
patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to,
changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy
terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that
result in unanticipated losses.  Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.
Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected
patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected
unpaid or unreported losses.
Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the
anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and
techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated
with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.
Additional Analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis,
determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an
anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to
reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected
loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include
estimates of known major catastrophe events.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and
incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual
risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for
estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the
individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.
For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the
business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid
or incurred development pattern indications.
In 2019, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated
ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $150 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss
emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities,
producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at
these rates.
We also reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ events for other casualty losses, excluding asbestos,
environmental, and other latent injury claims, by $23 million, reflecting lower than expected reported losses. For certain significant
casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence
patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction
in pre-tax earnings of approximately $850 million, although outcomes of less than $850 million are quite possible given the
diversification in worldwide business.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims were increased approximately
$150 million in 2019, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims, excluding
amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Loss estimations
for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if
new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.
Retroactive reinsurance
Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities
relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-
tails to be very long. Our gross unpaid losses, deferred charge assets, and net liabilities at December 31, 2019 were as follows (in
millions).
 
Gross unpaid
losses   Deferred
charges   Liabilities, net of
deferred charges  
$ 42,441  $ (13,747) $ 28,694
  
Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum
remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative
changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop
upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our $42.4 billion estimated liability.
We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our
liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various
scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor
subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying
losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are
revealed.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Retroactive reinsurance (Continued)
Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated
liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.9 billion at December 31, 2019. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed
data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or
aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of
ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends
and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory
environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant
impact on our ultimate liabilities.
We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $378 million in 2019, which
after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax losses of $125 million. In 2019, we paid losses and loss
adjustment expenses of $909 million with respect to these contracts.
In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception
represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. We amortize deferred charge
assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We
also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant
changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic
amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2019, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2020
will approximate $1.2 billion.
Other Critical Accounting Policies
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $81.9 billion and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets of $19.0 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our
most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2019. Our review of goodwill includes determining the estimated fair values
of our reporting units. Our review of other indefinite-lived intangible assets includes determining an estimated fair value of the
asset.
We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions
and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an
appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting
unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the
forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an
impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then, as required by
GAAP, the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
Market Risk Disclosures
Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market
risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable
volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.
K-59
 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Equity Price Risk
Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses
that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee.
Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2019, approximately 67% of the total
fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five issuers.
We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur
in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety
against short-term price volatility.
We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with
respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and
expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend
rates and the remaining duration of the contracts.
The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of
those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results
from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our
equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

(1) The hypothetical percentage increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet
date.
Interest Rate Risk
We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such
instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of
business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit
ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage
interest rate risks.
The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will
fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index
put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest
rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate
sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative
investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions.

Foreign Currency Risk
Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. In addition, we
hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant
foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and
do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in any meaningful way.
Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy
and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in

certain liabilities of Berkshire and U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in

Commodity Price Risk
Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price
risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and
services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our
operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any
significant degree.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 as required by
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-63.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’
equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for investments in equity
securities (excluding equity method investments) in 2018 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 “Financial Instruments –
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
K-63
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ( “claim liabilities ”) under short duration property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance contracts are $73,019 million as of December 31, 2019. The key assumptions affecting certain claim
liabilities include expected loss and expense ( “loss ”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment
emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were
appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2019, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,
including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions.
• We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by:
 • Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned
premium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.
 • Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential
bias in the determination of the claim liabilities.
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
 • We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as
needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.
 • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the
reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the

emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were
appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2019, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,

 • We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates, assessed
unexpected development and assessed internal rates of return.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1, 13, and 27 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair
value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of
each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests.
The Company primarily uses discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods to estimate fair value, which requires
management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes
(“EBIT”), and discount rate. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and
indefinite-lived intangible assets.
A reporting unit within the Manufacturing reportable segment, which had goodwill at acquisition date of $16,011 million, was an
acquisition made by the Company in 2016. This subsidiary also has certain customer relationships that are intangible assets with
indefinite lives. These customer relationships are a significant portion of the $18,965 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets
the Company reported as of December 31, 2019. The fair values of the reporting unit and customer relationships exceeded their
carrying values as of the annual evaluation date; therefore, no impairments were recognized.
Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit and the customer
relationships and the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the
reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the
discount rates required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair
value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and selection of the discount rates for the reporting unit and
customer relationships included the following, among others:
 • We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the
forecasts of future revenue and EBIT.
 • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year forecasts to
actual results in the respective years.
 • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts to
historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’
disclosures.
 • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth rates and
discount rates, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and
developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates and discount rates selected
by management.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2019
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices
 (a)Nature of operations and basis of consolidation
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse
business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing,
service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 27. Information concerning business
acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and
Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures
and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the
accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date.
Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable
interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its
economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right
to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
 (b)Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. In particular,
estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent
uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of
deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and
evaluations of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may
differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 (c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills
Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments (including U.S. Treasury
Bills) with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S.
Treasury Bills with maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value.
 (d)Investments in fixed maturity securities
We classify investments in fixed maturity securities at the acquisition date and re-evaluate the classification at each
balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to
hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are
carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and
are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of
December 31, 2019, substantially all of our investments in fixed maturity securities were classified as available-for-sale. We
amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest
method.
Investment gains and losses for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities are recorded when the securities are sold, as
determined on a specific identification basis. If the fair value of a fixed maturity security is less than cost, we evaluate the
security for other-than-temporary impairment. We recognize an other-than-temporary impairment if we (a) intend to sell or
expect to be required to sell the security before its amortized cost is recovered or (b) do not expect to ultimately recover the
amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security. Under scenario (a), we recognize the loss in earnings and
under scenario (b), we recognize the credit loss component in earnings and the remainder in other comprehensive income.
K-71
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (e)Investments in equity securities
We carry substantially all of our investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair
values in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings as a component of investment gains/losses. Prior to January 1, 2018,
substantially all of our equity security investments were classified as available-for-sale and were also carried at fair value.
However, we recorded the periodic changes in fair value of these securities as components of other comprehensive income.
In addition, we recorded gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when equity securities were sold (on a
specific identification basis) or were other-than-temporarily impaired.
 (f) Investments under the equity method
We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence,
but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is
presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be
overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is
restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other
investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock.
In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying
amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the
investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event
that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments
in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity
method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value.
 (g)Receivables
Receivables primarily consist of balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses
recoverable. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Allowances for uncollectible
balances are provided when it is probable counterparties or customers will be unable to pay all amounts due based on the
contractual terms. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
 (h)Loans and finance receivables
Loans and finance receivables are predominantly manufactured housing installment loans. We carry these loans at
amortized cost, net of allowances for uncollectible accounts, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity.
Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid or fees received along with acquisition premiums or
discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Substantially all of our loans and finance receivables
are secured by real or personal property or by other assets of the borrower.
Allowances for credit losses on loans include estimates of losses on loans currently in foreclosure and losses on loans
not currently in foreclosure. We estimate losses on loans in foreclosure based on historical experience and collateral recovery
rates. Estimates of losses on loans not currently in foreclosure consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates and
prevailing economic conditions. Allowances for credit losses also incorporate the historical average time elapsed from the
last payment until foreclosure.
Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due
on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to
the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than
90 days delinquent.
Loans in the foreclosure process are considered non-performing. Once a loan is in foreclosure, interest income is not
recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is
recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in
foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan
and the condition of the collateral securing the loan.

 (i) Derivatives
We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under
master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify
as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities
subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable.
 (j) Fair value measurements
As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists.
Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to
estimate fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to
be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance
or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting
market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.
 (k)Inventories
Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods acquired for resale, homes constructed for sale, and materials
consumed in business operations. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory
overhead. At December 31, 2019, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 37% of consolidated
inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under
LIFO was approximately $950 million as of December 31, 2019 and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018.
 (l) Property, plant and equipment
We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions,
improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as
certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed
assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized
costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance
the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property,
extend the useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods
where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a
composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or
salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is
recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.
We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to estimated salvage value primarily using
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other
businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and
furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad
business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other
equipment – 6 to 41 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses
are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets
– 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 3 to 30 years.

 (l) Property, plant and equipment (Continued)
We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering
event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value
from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable
amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to
impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in
evaluating the carrying value.
 (m)Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property from
others (“lessee” contracts).  We record additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We depreciate equipment held
for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 35
years. We use declining balance deprecation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is relatively
greater during the earlier years of its life and maintenance and repair costs increase during the later years. We also evaluate
equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment.
When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate.
The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms
that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use
assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates
are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment.
 (n)Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that
business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the
fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market
quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected
future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings.
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the identifiable
assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value as of the current testing date. The excess of the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit over the current estimated fair value of net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill.
The excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair
values and performing goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with
finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the
estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (o)Revenue recognition
We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss
exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, such premiums are earned
ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on
retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all of the underlying loss
events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are
earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with
experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 “Revenues from Contracts with
Customers.” Except as described in Note 1(x), our revenue recognition practices for contracts with customers under ASC 606
do not differ significantly from prior practices. Under ASC 606, revenues are recognized when a good or service is
transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service.
Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services
to our customers.
We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts
provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under
the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may
contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance
obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or
service.
Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may
be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed
to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue
excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for
shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat
consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue.
Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the
customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement.
We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings,
forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the
customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the
customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract.
Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory
commissions. These tariff based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and
have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is
delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business.
Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the
customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due
from the customer within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or
contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate
performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable
regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued.
K-75
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
 (o)Revenue recognition (Continued)
The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a
point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series
of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are
based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair, and contract incentives which
are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing
quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified
destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously
receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as
of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within
30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping
to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future
customer shipments.
Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time,
where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services, or at a point in time when the services are
provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management,
aviation training, franchising and news distribution services.
Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the
terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our leases are classified as operating leases. Prior to January 1, 2018, we
recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft over the term of the related management
services agreements, as the transfers of the ownership interests were inseparable from the management services agreements.
These agreements also include provisions that require us to repurchase the fractional interest at fair market value at contract
termination or upon the customer’s request following the end of a minimum commitment period. ASC 606 provides that such
contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts and not ASC 606. The re-characterization of these fractional
ownership interests as operating leases did not have a significant effect on our consolidated revenues or earnings.
 (p)Losses and loss adjustment expenses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed under property/casualty insurance and
reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the
estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value.
We base liability estimates on (1) reports of losses from policyholders, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates
of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include
paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged
to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts.
Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the
underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts.
 (q)Retroactive reinsurance contracts
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses assumed under retroactive reinsurance of short
duration contracts consistent with other short duration property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts discussed in
Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the
contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We
subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method.
Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We
apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic
amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

 (r) Insurance policy acquisition costs
We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate
recoverability, and we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Direct
incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts.
We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs
generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were
$2,937 million and $2,658 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 (s) Life and annuity insurance benefits
We compute our liabilities for insurance benefits under life contracts based upon estimated future investment yields,
expected mortality, morbidity, and lapse or withdrawal rates as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and
expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and
may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate
assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit
rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates
generally range from 3% to 7.5%.
 (t) Regulated utilities and energy businesses
Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated
operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the
requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain
costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities
will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods.
Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by
considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated
entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory
rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers.
 (u)Foreign currency
The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other
than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange
rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. Gains or
losses from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities
due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings.
 (v)Income taxes
Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In
addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax
liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for
the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax
bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with
components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise,
changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on
deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax
expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is
not likely.

 (v)Income taxes (Continued)
Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax
returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of
the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax
expense.
 (w)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019
Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a
liability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past
lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not
recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with
regard to contracts in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements.
Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $6.2 billion and
lease liabilities of $5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $300 million. Consequently, our consolidated
assets and liabilities increased by approximately $5.9 billion. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for
our lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases.
 (x)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2018
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” ASU 2018-02 “Reclassification of Certain Tax
Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Prior
year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02
and ASC 606 on our shareholders’ equity follows (in millions).
 
  ASU 2016-01  ASU 2018-02  ASC 606  Total  
Increase (decrease):                 
Accumulated other comprehensive income  $(61,459) $ 84  $ —  $(61,375)
Retained earnings   61,459   (84)  (70)  61,305 
Shareholders’ equity   —   —   (70)  (70)
 
With respect to ASU 2016-01, beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses from the changes in the fair values of
our equity securities during the period are included within investment gains/losses in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. As of January 1, 2018, we reclassified net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other
comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified the stranded deferred income tax
effects arising from the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were
included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2018 to retained earnings.
In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect
recorded to retained earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenues from the sales of fractional ownership
interests in aircraft over the term of the related management services agreements. As discussed in Note 1(o), ASC 606
provides that such contracts are subject to accounting guidance for lease contracts. The principal effects of this re-
characterization were to increase equipment held for lease and aircraft repurchase liabilities and unearned lease revenues by
approximately $3.5 billion.

 (y)New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2019
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-13, which together with
subsequent FASB amendments, were codified in ASC 326 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses.” ASC 326 provides for
the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost.
ASC 326 also modifies impairment loss recognition measurement for available-for-sale debt securities. Under existing
accounting principles, credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing
facts and circumstances. ASC 326 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are adopting
ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020 and do not expect its adoption will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04
eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption of
ASU 2017-04, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value
over its fair value and will be limited to the carrying value of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment
tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and we are adopting ASU 2017-14 as of January 1, 2020.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration
Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value
policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs arising from the issuance of long-duration insurance and reinsurance
contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount
rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at
the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new
disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are
evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Business acquisitions
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and
able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial
Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company (“Medical Liability Mutual”), a writer of
medical professional liability insurance domiciled in New York. At that time, Medical Liability Mutual’s name was changed to
MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”). The acquisition price was approximately $2.5 billion.  As of the acquisition date, the fair
value of MLMIC’s assets was approximately $6.1 billion, including cash ($230 million) and investments ($5.2 billion), and the fair
value of its liabilities was approximately $3.6 billion, consisting primarily of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ($3.2
billion).
In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as “bolt-
ons” to several of our existing business operations. Aggregate consideration paid for bolt-on acquisitions, net of cash acquired was
approximately $1.7 billion in 2019, $1.0 billion in 2018 and $2.7 billion in 2017. We do not believe that these acquisitions are
material, individually or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

On April 30, 2019, Berkshire committed to invest a total of $10 billion in connection with Occidental Petroleum
Corporation’s (“Occidental”) proposal to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”). The Anadarko shareholders
approved the acquisition by Occidental on August 8, 2019 and the acquisition and our investment in Occidental closed on August 8,
2019. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding table.
Berkshire’s investments in Occidental include newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an
aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion, together with warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock
at an exercise price of $62.50 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of
Occidental commencing on the tenth anniversary of issuance at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference plus
any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or mandatorily under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred
stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole
or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock.
(5)Equity method investments
Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method.
Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft
Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces,
cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152
shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6% of the outstanding shares.

(5)Equity method investments (Continued)
Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment at December 31, 2019 and
2018 was approximately $10.5 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively. The carrying value of our investment at both December 31,
2019 and 2018 was approximately $13.8 billion. We recorded equity method earnings of $493 million in 2019, losses of
approximately $2.7 billion in 2018, and earnings of approximately $2.9 billion in 2017. In 2019 and 2018, our equity method
earnings/losses included our share of the after-tax intangible asset impairment losses recorded by Kraft Heinz. Kraft Heinz recorded
pre-tax impairment losses of approximately $1.9 billion in 2019 and $15.9 billion in 2018. In 2017, our equity method earnings
included our share of certain one-time effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on Kraft Heinz’s net earnings. We received
dividends on the common stock of $521 million in 2019, $814 million in 2018 and $797 million in 2017, which we recorded as
reductions in our carrying value.
As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz exceeded the fair value based on the quoted
market price by $3.3 billion (24%). In light of that fact, we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no
bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz,
our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, the relative amount of the decline, and the length of time that fair value
was less than carrying value, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will
continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in a future period based
on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions.

Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage
LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our
investments in these entities was approximately $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2018.
Our equity method earnings in these entities were $683 million in 2019, $563 million in 2018 and $76 million in 2017. Additional
information concerning these investments follows.
We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia
is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S.
government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial
institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to
$1.5 billion. On December 31, 2019, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. The commercial paper is
supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any
losses incurred under the policy. In addition, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50% interest in ETT, an
owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power
owns the other 50% interest.
On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a
38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is one of the largest operators of travel centers in North
America, with more than 28,000 team members, 750 locations across the U.S. and Canada, and more than $30 billion in annual
revenues. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We also
entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest.
As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

  $ 71,123  $ (22,155) $ 1,410
 
 
Prior to 2018, we recognized investment gains and losses in earnings when we sold or otherwise disposed of equity securities
based on the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the cost of the securities and also when we recognized other-than-
temporary impairment losses. Beginning in 2018, investment gains and losses included in earnings also include unrealized gains
and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own. Prior to 2018, we recorded the changes in
unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities in other comprehensive income.
As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $14.3 billion in 2019 and
$18.8 billion in 2018 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold during
2019 and 2018 reflect the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity security sold at the beginning of
the period or the purchase date, if later. Our taxable gains on equity securities sold during the year, which are generally the
difference between the proceeds from sales and our original cost, were $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018.

Loans and finance receivables are predominantly installment loans originated or acquired by our manufactured housing
business. Provisions for loan losses for 2019 and 2018 were $125 million and $141 million, respectively. Loan charge-offs, net of
recoveries, were $135 million in 2019 and $144 million in 2018. At December 31, 2019, approximately 98% of the manufactured
housing loan balances were evaluated collectively for impairment, with the remainder evaluated individually. As part of the
evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing or non-performing. At
December 31, 2019, we considered approximately 99% of the loan balances to be performing and approximately 96% of the loan
balances to be current as to payment status.
Additionally, in 2018, we entered into an agreement with Seritage Growth Properties to provide a $2.0 billion term loan
facility, which matures on July 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding loans under the facility were approximately
$1.6 billion.

(14)Derivative contracts
We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. Currently, the most significant derivative contracts
consist of equity index put option contracts. The liabilities and related notional values of these contracts follows (in millions).
 
  Liabilities   Notional
Value  
December 31, 2019  $ 968  $ 14,385 
December 31, 2018   2,452   26,759
  
Notional value represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each
contract’s expiration date. Certain of these contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Notional amounts are based on the
foreign currency exchange rates as of each balance sheet date.
We recorded derivative contract gains of $1,484 million in 2019, losses of $300 million in 2018 and gains of $718 million in
2017, with respect to our equity index put option contracts. The gains in 2019 were primarily due to increases in equity index
values.
The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes.
During 2019, contracts with notional values of approximately $12.3 billion expired and substantially all of the remaining contracts
will expire by February 2023. At December 31, 2019, the remaining weighted average life of all contracts was approximately 1.8
years. We received aggregate premiums of $2.5 billion on the remaining contracts at the contract inception dates and we have no
counterparty credit risk.  Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below
the contract strike price at the expiration date.  The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are
settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) was $397 million at
December 31, 2019 and $1,653 million at December 31, 2018. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled
before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the
contract expiration dates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(14)Derivative contracts (Continued)
Our regulated utility subsidiaries may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of
their commodity price risks. Most of these net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of
recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Derivative contract assets were $145 million and
$172 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Derivative contract liabilities were $76 million and $111 million at
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
(15)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and
casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences
as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in
claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 16), for each of the three years ending
December 31, 2019 is as follows (in millions).

Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the preceding table were recorded in earnings in each period and related to
insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident
years”). Current accident year losses included approximately $1.0 billion in 2019, $1.6 billion in 2018 and $3.0 billion in 2017
from significant catastrophe events occurring in each year. The effects of businesses acquired (or disposed) are included (or
excluded) on a retrospective basis for all years presented in the disaggregated accident year incurred and paid loss and allocated
loss adjustment expenses data shown in this Note.  
We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $752 million in 2019, $1,406 million
in 2018 and $544 million in 2017, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These
reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 1.1% in 2019, 2.4% in 2018 and 1.1% in 2017.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $457 million in 2019,
$937 million in 2018 and $249 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated medical
professional liability and workers’ compensation losses, partially offset by higher commercial auto and other liability losses. The
decreases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to workers’ compensation and medical professional liability claims.  Liabilities
for prior years’ private passenger auto claims were reduced in 2018 and increased in 2017. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior
years’ loss events related to property and casualty reinsurance were reduced $295 million in 2019, $469 million in 2018 and
$295 million in 2017.

(15)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated claim liabilities include amounts for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures, net of reinsurance
recoverable, of approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in
the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably
possible for these claims.

GEICO
GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage
claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and
techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in
loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates.
We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to
establishing an individual case reserve when we have insufficient time or information to make specific claim estimates and for a
large number of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish liability case loss estimates,
which include loss adjustment expenses, once the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated.
Estimates for liability coverages are more uncertain than for physical damage coverages primarily due to the longer claim-
tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The
“claim-tail” is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date. Consequently, we establish additional case
development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated
by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting
reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of
unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when
actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.

GEICO’s incurred and paid losses and ALAE, net of reinsurance, are summarized by accident year below for physical
damage and auto liability claims. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2019. Claim counts are established
when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims
under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the
combined number of reported claims for all policy coverages and excludes projected IBNR claims. Dollars are in millions.

BH Primary
BH Primary’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily derive from medical professional liability
and workers’ compensation and other casualty insurance, including commercial auto and general liability insurance. Incurred and
paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability
coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31,
2019. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately
resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions.
BH Primary Medical Professional Liability
We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities
using commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the paid and incurred development method, Bornhuetter-Ferguson based
methods, hindsight outstanding severity method, trended severity method and trended pure premium method. These methodologies
produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. Periodically, we study developments in older accident years and
adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent development based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

BH Primary Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty
We periodically evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for the workers’ compensation and other
casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-
ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the
different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also
separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims
investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the
claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis
liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

BHRG
We use a variety of methodologies to establish BHRG’s estimates for property and casualty claims liabilities. We use certain
methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques
and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.
Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR
liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of
the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may
establish case liabilities based on our estimates.
K-92
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(15)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are
evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Case and IBNR liability estimates for
major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss
event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable.
Incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails
(property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple
lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report
loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on
internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year, net of reinsurance.
IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2019. Dollars are in millions.

(16)Retroactive reinsurance contracts
Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance
contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence
immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of
the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and
related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).

In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the
contracts. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or
meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported
claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value.
In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc.
(collectively, “AIG”) to indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in excess of
$25 billion retained by AIG, with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring prior to 2016. At the inception of
the contract, we recorded premiums earned of $10.2 billion, and we also recorded a liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment
expenses of $16.4 billion and a deferred charge reinsurance assumed asset of $6.2 billion.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we increased our estimated ultimate claim liabilities under the aforementioned AIG contract by
approximately $1.8 billion based on higher than expected loss payments reported by AIG under the contractual retention. We also
increased the related deferred charge asset by $1.7 billion based on our re-estimation of the amounts and timing of future claim
payments. The estimated ultimate claim liabilities with respect to the AIG contract were approximately $18.2 billion at both
December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the related deferred charge assets were approximately $6.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and
$6.9 billion at December 31, 2018.
K-95
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(16)Retroactive reinsurance contracts (Continued)
Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $1,188 million in 2019,
$919 million in 2018 and $458 million in 2017, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes
in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments.
In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project
losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts,
with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information
concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when
significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes.
Our retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury
exposures of approximately $12.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and $13.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Retroactive reinsurance
contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise
limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government
regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors
could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate
the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.

Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund
manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. During 2019, BHFC repaid
$3.95 billion of maturing senior notes. In 2019, BHFC issued $2.0 billion of 4.25% senior notes due in 2049 and £1.75 billion of
senior notes consisting of £1.0 billion of 2.375% senior notes due in 2039 and £750 million of 2.625% senior notes due in 2059.
Such borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire.
The carrying values of our non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.85 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥430 billion par)
reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during
the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates
resulted in pre-tax gains of $192 million in 2019 and $366 million in 2018 and losses of $990 million in 2017.

BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of
certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing
arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios
and/or debt service coverage ratios. During 2019, BHE and its subsidiaries issued approximately $4.6 billion of long-term debt,
with maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2059 and with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%. In January 2020, a BHE
subsidiary issued $725 million of term debt consisting of $425 million of 2.4% notes due in 2030 and $300 million of 3.125% notes
due in 2050.
BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In July 2019, BNSF issued $825 million of 3.55% senior
unsecured debentures due in 2050.  As of December 31, 2019, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all
applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2019, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating
approximately $7.1 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity.  Such unused lines of credit
included approximately $5.6 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

(18)Income taxes (Continued)
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”).
Among its provisions, the TCJA reduced the statutory U.S. Corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
The TCJA also provided for a one-time tax on certain accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
Further, the TCJA includes provisions that, in certain instances, impose U.S. income tax liabilities on earnings of foreign
subsidiaries and limit the deductibility of interest expenses. The TCJA also provides for accelerated deductions of certain capital
expenditures made after September 27, 2017 through bonus depreciation.
In 2017, upon the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded a reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities of approximately
$35.6 billion for the effect of the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of
approximately $29.6 billion and we increased regulatory liabilities of our regulated utility subsidiaries by approximately
$6.0 billion for the portion of the deferred income tax liability reduction that we will be required to, effectively, refund to customers
in the rate setting process. We also recognized an income tax charge of approximately $1.4 billion with respect to the deemed
repatriation of the accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Thus, upon the enactment of the
TCJA, we included a net income tax benefit in our 2017 earnings of approximately $28.2 billion. In 2018, we reduced our estimate
of the income taxes on the deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries and recognized additional deferred income tax
rate change effects.

are shown below (in millions).

We have not established deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which
are expected to be reinvested indefinitely. Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable
to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes

We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax
liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011. The IRS is auditing Berkshire’s consolidated
U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2012 through 2016 tax years. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to
income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be
settled in 2020. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, net unrecognized tax benefits were $952 million and $549 million, respectively. Included
in the balance at December 31, 2019, were $795 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The
remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly
certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, these
positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate. In 2019, we recorded income tax expense of
$377 million for uncertain tax positions related to investments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment funds that generated
income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax benefits are not
valid.  As of December 31, 2019, we do not expect any material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits in
the next twelve months.
(19)Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries
Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior
regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $21 billion as ordinary dividends during
2020.
Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules
(Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $216 billion at December 31, 2019 and $162 billion at December 31, 2018.
Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and
liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain
investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the
carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and the carrying values of non-insurance entities owned by our insurance
subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes.

(20)Fair value measurements (Continued)
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The
hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.
Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.
Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged
in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as
interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that
are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations
generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar
characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same
industry sector.
Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is
required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets
or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to
make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets
or liabilities.
Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2019 follow (in millions).

We acquired investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Occidental Preferred”) and Occidental
common stock warrants in August 2019 at an aggregate cost of $10 billion. We currently consider the fair value measurements to
contain Level 3 inputs. See Note 4. We acquired preferred stock and common stock warrants of Bank of America Corporation
(“BAC”) in 2011. We exercised the BAC warrants to acquire BAC common stock in August 2017. As payment of the cost to
acquire the BAC common stock, we surrendered substantially all of the BAC preferred stock. Additionally, in December 2017,
Restaurant Brands International Inc. (“RBI”) redeemed a $3 billion private placement security that we acquired in 2014. During
2017, we concluded the Level 3 inputs used in the previous fair value determinations of the BAC warrants, BAC preferred stock
and RBI investments were not significant and we transferred these measurements from Level 3 to Level 2.
Quantitative information as of December 31, 2019, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on
a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions).

Investments in equity securities at December 31, 2019 included the Occidental Preferred and common stock warrants. These
investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from
economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the Occidental Preferred, we made
assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment. The Occidental Preferred is redeemable at Occidental’s option
beginning in 2029. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the Occidental Preferred has a lower priority
in liquidation than debt instruments. In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While
most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants.
The Occidental common stock warrants expire on the one-year anniversary on which no Occidental Preferred remains outstanding.
Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For
example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put
option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Given the current index values, remaining contract
durations and applicable strike prices for these contracts, we believe the only significant model input after December 31, 2019 is
the prevailing index price, which is observable.

Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution
rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses
voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under
Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common
stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not
convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,624,958 shares outstanding as
of December 31, 2019 and 1,640,929 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are
economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding
represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding.
Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A
shares outstanding.
For several years, Berkshire had a common stock repurchase program, which permitted Berkshire to repurchase its Class A
and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of
Directors authorized an amendment to the program, permitting Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett,
Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the
repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases
in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be
repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash
equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase
any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

(24)Revenues from contracts with customers
On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Under ASC 606, revenues are
recognized when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains
control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to
deliver goods and services to our customers.
The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were
primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues which are not within the
scope of ASC 606.

(25)Pension plans
Several of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees. Benefits under the plans are
generally based on years of service and compensation, although benefits under certain plans are based on years of service and fixed
benefit rates. Our subsidiaries may make contributions to the plans to meet regulatory requirements and may also make
discretionary contributions. The components of our net periodic pension expense for each of the three years ending December 31,
2019 were as follows (in millions).
 
  2019   2018   2017  
Service cost  $ 224  $ 271  $ 273 
Interest cost   618   593   635

Amortization of actuarial losses and other   26   188   157 
Net periodic pension expense  $ (68) $ 64  $ 126
 
 
The accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based on service and compensation prior
to the valuation date. The projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service
and compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Benefit
obligations under qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in trusts. Pension obligations under
certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded and the aggregate PBOs of such plans were approximately
$1.3 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Reconciliations of the changes in plan assets and PBOs related to BHE’s pension plans and all other pension plans for each
of the two years ending December 31, 2019 are in the following tables (in millions). The costs of pension plans covering employees
of certain regulated subsidiaries of BHE are generally recoverable through the regulated rate making process.

liabilities was $3,067 million. At December 31, 2018, the funded status included in assets was $510 million and in liabilities was
$2,473 million.

Refer to Note 20 for a discussion of the three levels in the hierarchy of fair values. Plan assets are generally invested with the
long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk.
Allocations may change as a result of changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on
plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected invested asset returns over a period of several years. Generally, past
investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on
plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates.

Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans.
Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for employer
matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by
management. Employer contributions expensed with respect to our defined contribution plans were $1,233 million in 2019,
$1,009 million in 2018 and $1,001 million in 2017.

(26)Contingencies and Commitments
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions
seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by
Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine
litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are
also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We
believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.
Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their
businesses. As of December 31, 2019, estimated future payments under such arrangements were as follows: $15.7 billion in 2020,
$5.6 billion in 2021, $3.7 billion in 2022, $2.8 billion in 2023, $2.6 billion in 2024 and $19.7 billion after 2024.  The most
significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our fractional aircraft ownership business.
Pursuant to the terms of agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be
obligated to acquire their equity interests. If we had acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2019, we
estimate the cost would have been approximately $5.4 billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments
that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners.
(27)Business segment data
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We
organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain
businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and
distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management.
The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated
Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those
transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and
derivative gains/losses, amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s business
acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units.
Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts.

At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the
Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive
Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and

S-K is incorporated herein by reference to Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included on page

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska
Opinion on the Financial Statement Schedule
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, and have issued our report thereon dated February 22, 2020; such
consolidated financial statements and report are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule of the Company listed in the Index at Item 15. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statement schedule based on our
audits. In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements of the Company, the Company has changed its method of accounting for
investments in equity securities (excluding equity method investments) in 2018 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 “Financial
Instruments – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.”

Note to Condensed Financial Information
Berkshire acquired 50% of the outstanding common stock of Heinz Holding Company in 2013. After a series of transactions
in 2015, that interest represented 26.8% of the outstanding common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Berkshire
currently owns 26.6% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock. Reference is made to Note 5 to the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In 2019, the Parent Company issued ¥430.0 billion of senior notes with various maturities and interest rates. See Note 17 to
the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For each of the three years ending December 31,
2019, Parent Company borrowings also included €6.85 billion senior notes. The gains and losses from the periodic remeasurement
of these non-U.S. Dollar denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are included in earnings.
Parent Company debt maturities over the next five years are as follows: 2020—$1,122 million; 2021—$2,117 million; 2022
—$613 million; 2023—$3,958 million and 2024—$2,120 million. At December 31, 2019, Parent Company guarantees of debt
obligations of certain of its subsidiaries were approximately $12.2 billion. Such guarantees are an absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations. Parent Company has
also provided guarantees in connection with equity index put option contracts and certain retroactive reinsurance contracts of
subsidiaries. The amounts of subsidiary payments under these contracts, if any, is contingent upon the outcome of future events.
In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted, which reduced the Parent Company’s income
tax expense in 2017 by $550 million, primarily due to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities attributable to the lower U.S. statutory
rate, partly offset by a one-time income tax expense on certain accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The
effects of the TCJA on income tax expense of consolidated subsidiaries is included in undistributed earnings in consolidated
subsidiaries.
