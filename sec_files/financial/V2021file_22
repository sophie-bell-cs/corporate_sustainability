ITEM 1.    Business
OVERVIEW
Visa is one of the world’s leaders in digital payments. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative,
reliable and secure payments network — enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive. We facilitate global
commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants,
financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities through innovative technologies.
Since Visa’s inception in 1958, Visa has been in the business of facilitating payments between consumers and
businesses. With new ways to pay, we have evolved into a global company that is a trusted engine of commerce, working to
provide payment solutions for everyone, everywhere. We are focused on extending, enhancing and investing in our proprietary
network, VisaNet, while seeking new ways to offer products and services and become a single connection point for facilitating
any payment transaction, using our network, other networks, or a combination of networks. We offer products and solutions
that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem.
•We facilitate secure, reliable and convenient transactions among financial institutions, merchants and
consumers. We have traditionally referred to this as the “four-party” model. As the payments ecosystem continues to
evolve, we have broadened this model to include digital banks, digital wallets and a range of financial technology
companies (fintechs), governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We provide transaction processing
services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through
VisaNet, our advanced transaction processing network. During fiscal year 2021, we saw 232 billion payments and
cash transactions with Visa’s brand, equating to an average of 637 million transactions per day. Of the 232 billion total
transactions, 165 billion were processed by Visa.
•We offer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products that our 15,100 financial institution clients use to develop
and offer core business solutions, including credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for individual, business
and government account holders. During fiscal year 2021, Visa’s total payments and cash volume was $13 trillion, and
3.7 billion credentials were available worldwide to be used at more than 80 millionmerchant locations.
•We take an open partnership approach and seek to provide value by enabling access to our global network,
including offering our technology capabilities through application programming interfaces (APIs). We partner with both
traditional and emerging players to innovate and expand the payments ecosystem, allowing them to leverage the
resources of our platform to scale and grow their businesses more quickly and effectively.
•We are accelerating the migration to digital payments and evolving Visa to be a “network of networks” to enable
the movement of money through all available networks. We aim to provide a single connection point so that Visa
clients can enable money movement for businesses, governments, and consumers regardless of which network is
used to start or complete the transaction; ultimately, helping to unify a complex payments ecosystem. Visa’s network
of networks approach creates opportunities by facilitating person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C),
business-to-business (B2B), business-to-small business (B2b) and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments, in
addition to consumer to business (C2B) payments.
•We provide value added services to our clients, including issuer solutions; acceptance solutions; risk and identity
solutions; and advisory services.
•We invest in and promote our brand to the benefit of our clients and partners through advertising, promotional and
sponsorship initiatives with FIFA, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee and
the National Football League (NFL), among others. We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment
innovations.

FISCAL YEAR 2021 KEY STATISTICS
     Please see Item 7–Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-
GAAP financial results.
OUR CORE BUSINESS
In an example of a typical Visa C2B payment transaction, the consumer purchases goods or services from a merchant
using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer, usually a bank or third-party
processing firm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or payment products, for verification and processing. Through VisaNet,
the acquirer presents the transaction data to Visa, which in turn contacts the issuer to check the account holder’s account or
credit line for authorization. After the transaction is authorized, the issuer effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the
value of the transaction, minus the interchange reimbursement fee, and then posts the transaction to the consumer’s account.
The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, minus the merchant discount rate (MDR), to the merchant.
Visa earns revenue by facilitating money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of
consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities through innovative
technologies. Net revenues consist of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and
other revenues, minus client incentive arrangements we have with our clients. We have one reportable segment, which is
Payment Services. We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business.
Visa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit, or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa
products nor do we earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of these activities. Interchange reimbursement
fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits
that account holders and merchants derive from participating in our payments networks. Generally, interchange reimbursement
fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers. We establish default interchange reimbursement fees that apply absent
other established settlement terms. In addition, we do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged by
acquirers for acceptance, including(1)

the MDR. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants as well as establishing and earning these
fees.
Our net revenues in fiscal year 2021 consisted of the following:

Table of Contents
Visa’s strategy is to accelerate our revenue growth in consumer payments, new flows and value added services, and
fortify the key foundations of our business model.
We seek to accelerate revenue growth in three primary areas — consumer payments, new flows and value added
services.
Consumer Payments
We are accelerating efforts to move approximately $18 trillion in consumer spending still exchanged in cash and check
to cards and digital accounts on Visa’s network of networks.
Core Products
Visa’s growth has been driven by the strength of our core products — credit, debit and prepaid products.
Credit: Credit cards and digital credentials allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay for goods and
services. Credit cards are affiliated with programs operated by financial institution clients, co-brand partners, fintechs and
affinity partners.
Debit: Debit cards and digital credentials allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods and services using
funds held in their bank accounts. Debit cards enable account holders to transact in person, online or via mobile without
needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit. The Visa/PLUS Global ATM network also provides debit,
credit and prepaid account holders with cash access, and other banking capabilities, in more than 200 countries and
territories worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both financial institutions and independent ATM
operators.
 Estimate as of December 2018.(2)

Table of Contents
Prepaid: Prepaid cards and digital credentials draw from a designated balance funded by individuals, businesses or
governments. Prepaid cards address many use cases and needs, including general purpose reloadable, payroll,
government and corporate disbursements, healthcare, gift and travel. Visa-branded prepaid cards also play an important
part in financial inclusion, bringing payment solutions to those with limited or no access to traditional banking products.
Capabilities
We offer capabilities, tools and solutions that enable consumer payments and help our clients grow as digital commerce,
new technologies and new participants continue to transform the payments ecosystem. Some of our offerings include:
Tap to Pay
As we seek to improve the user experience in the face-to-face environment, contactless payments or tap to pay, which is
tapping a contactless card or mobile device on a terminal to make a payment, has emerged as a preferred way to pay among
consumers in many countries around the world. Tap to pay adoption is growing and many consumers have come to expect
touchless payment experiences. In addition, Visa continues to work with payments industry partners and governments to
support raising contactless payment limits.
Globally we have more than 20 countries with more than 90 percent contactless penetration and nearly 70 countries
where tap to pay is more than 50 percent of face-to-face transactions. Excluding the United States, nearly 70 percent of face-
to-face transactions globally were contactless. In the U.S., Visa has more than 15 percent contactless penetration. We have
400 million tap-to-pay-enabled Visa cards, and now three cities have above 25 percent face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration:
New York, San Francisco and San Jose. We have activated nearly 500 contactless public transport projects worldwide and
have nearly 750 projects in our pipeline.
Tokenization
Visa Token Service (VTS) brings trust to digital commerce innovation. As consumers increasingly rely on digital
transactions, VTS is designed to enhance the digital ecosystem through improved authorization, reduced fraud and improved
customer experience. VTS helps protect digital transactions by replacing 16-digit Visa account numbers with a token protecting
the underlying account information. This security technology can work for a variety of payment transactions, both in the
physical and online space.
The issuance of network tokens continues to accelerate. In the past 17 months, we have more than doubled the number
of network tokens issued from one billion to 2.6 billion. By comparison, it took nearly six years to reach our first one billion
network tokens.
Click to Pay
Click to Pay provides a simplified and more consistent cardholder checkout experience online by removing time-
consuming key entry of personal information and enabling consumer and transaction data to be passed securely between
payments network participants. Based on the EMV® Secure Remote Commerce industry standard, Click to Pay brings a
standardized and streamlined approach to online checkout and meets the needs of consumers shopping across a growing
number of connected devices. The goal of Click to Pay is to make digital payments safe, consistent, and interoperable like the
checkout experience in physical stores.
Cryptocurrency
We enable cryptocurrencies for everyday payments through our global presence, partnership approach and trusted
brand. We want to serve as the bridge between the crypto ecosystem and our global network, which would enable our clients
to provide consumers the ability to easily convert cryptocurrencies into fiat and access our global network of more than 80
million merchant locations and 15,100 financial institutions. In fiscal year 2021, we had $3.5 billion in payments volume on
crypto-linked card programs, which are crypto wallets linked to Visa credentials
8
Table of Contents
where cryptocurrencies are converted to fiat currency before funds can be accessed through the Visa credential. We are
advancing this effort through our partnerships with nearly 60 crypto platforms on crypto-linked Visa card programs. We are
also building infrastructure capabilities and value added services to support crypto use cases, including future settlement in
digital currencies, a new Visa Crypto API platform to help financial institutions create a cryptocurrency offering, assisting
central banks as they evaluate digital currencies and a growing number of other services and infrastructure capabilities.
New Flows
New flows represent a $185 trillion volume opportunity. Visa’s network of networks approach creates opportunities to
capture new sources of money movement through card and non-card flows for consumers, businesses and governments
around the world by facilitating P2P, B2C, B2B, B2b and G2C payments.
Visa Direct
Visa Direct is Visa’s global, real-time push payments platform, which reverses the traditional card payment flow by
allowing payment originators, through their acquirer, to push funds directly to eligible debit and prepaid cards or accounts. It
helps facilitate fast, simple and secure money movement around the world, enabling businesses and consumers to send
money directly to a bank account or card, including domestic or cross-border payouts and payments, P2P, payments to small
businesses, and corporate, worker, insurance and government payouts.
In fiscal year 2021, we had 5.2 billion Visa Direct transactions, an increase of 50 percent year over year, and more than
20 use cases and 500 programs. Visa Direct connected 16 card-based networks, 66 automated clearing house (ACH)
schemes, seven real time payment (RTP) networks and five gateways. With the addition of Visa Direct Payouts, Visa Direct
provides access to almost 6 billion credentials across more than 200 countries and territories.
Visa Business Solutions
We are also extending our network with B2B payments. Our three strategic areas of focus include investing and growing
card-based payments, accelerating our efforts in non-card, cross-border payments and digitizing domestic accounts payable
and accounts receivable processes. We offer a portfolio of business payment solutions, including small business, corporate
(travel) cards, purchasing cards, virtual cards and digital credentials, non-card cross-border B2B payment options and
disbursement accounts, covering most major industry segments around the world. Business solutions are designed to bring
efficiency, controls and automation to small businesses, commercial and government payment processes, ranging from
employee travel to fully integrated, invoice-based payables.
Visa B2B Connect is a multilateral B2B cross-border payments network designed to facilitate transactions from the bank
of origin directly to the beneficiary bank, helping streamline settlement and optimize payments for financial institutions’
corporate client base. The network delivers B2B cross-border payments that are predictable, flexible, data-rich, secure and
cost-effective. Visa B2B Connect continues to scale, with the ability to operate in more than 100 countries and territories.

Value Added Services
Value added services represent an opportunity for us to diversify our revenue with products and solutions that
differentiate our network, deepen our client relationships and deliver innovative solutions across other networks.
Issuer Solutions
Visa Debit Processing Service (DPS) is one of the largest issuer processors of Visa debit transactions in the world and is
able to deliver agility at scale. Visa DPS provides a wide range of debit, prepaid and credit value added services to clients
including call center services, data analytics, campaign management, fraud and risk solutions, and a white-label branded
mobile app. Visa DPS continues to extend and expand our capabilities in modern, API-based issuer processing solutions
called DPS Forward, which will be used for both the U.S. and international markets. We have expanded Visa DPS into Europe,
providing European issuers in select countries access to a comprehensive and end-to-end solution, from core processing
services to value added services.
We also provide a range of other services and digital solutions to issuers, such as account controls, digital issuance,
branded consumer experiences and buy now pay later (BNPL) capabilities. BNPL or installment payments allow shoppers the
flexibility to pay for a purchase in equal payments over a defined period of time. Visa is investing in installments as a payments
strategy — by offering our own solution, Visa Installments — and by partnering with innovative installments providers who use
our cards and services to support a wider variety of installment options. Visa Installments offers issuing banks the opportunity
to offer Visa cardholders the option to divide their total purchase amount into smaller payments during or after checkout, at the
store and online at participating merchants.
Acceptance Solutions
Cybersource is a global payment management platform that provides modular, digital capabilities in addition to the
traditional gateway function of connecting merchants to payment processing. Using Cybersource, merchants of all sizes can
improve the way their consumers engage and transact, mitigate fraud and security risk, lower operational costs and adapt to
changing business requirements. Cybersource white-labeled capabilities provide new and enhanced payment integrations with
ecommerce platforms, enabling sellers and acquirers to provide tailored commerce experiences with payments seamlessly
embedded. Cybersource enables an omnichannel solution with a cloud-based architecture to deliver more innovation at the
point-of-sale.
In addition, we provide secure, reliable services for merchants and acquirers that reduce friction and drive acceptance.
Examples include Global Urban Mobility, which allows transit operators to accept Visa contactless payments in addition to
proprietary closed-loop payment solutions; Rapid Seller Onboarding, which enables digital onboarding of small businesses and
acquirers; and Visa Account Updater, which provides updated account information to merchants to strengthen customer
relationships and retention. Visa also offers dispute management services, including a network agnostic solution with Verifi that
enables merchants to prevent and resolve disputes with a single connection.
Risk and Identity Solutions
Visa’s risk and identity solutions transform data into insights for near real-time decisions and facilitate account holder
authentication to help clients prevent fraud and protect account holder data. With the increasing popularity of omnichannel
commerce among consumers, preventing fraud helps increase trust in digital payments. Solutions such as Visa Advanced
Authorization, Visa Secure, Visa Advanced Identity Score, Visa Consumer Authentication Service, and payment-decisioning
solutions from CardinalCommerce empower financial institutions and merchants with tools that help automate and simplify
fraud prevention and enhance payment security.
These value added payment security tools layer on top of a suite of programs that protect the safety and integrity of the
payment ecosystem, and along with our investments in intelligence and technology, help to prevent, detect and mitigate
threats. These programs and Visa’s fraud prevention expertise are among the core benefits of being part of the Visa network.
Through the combined efforts of security and identity tools and services, payment and cyber intelligence, insights and
learnings from client/partner breach investigations and law enforcement

engagement, Visa helps protect financial institutions and merchants from fraud and solve payment security challenges. 
Advisory Services
Visa Consulting and Analytics is the payments consulting advisory arm of Visa. The combination of our deep payments
expertise, proprietary analytical models applied to a breadth of data and our economic intelligence allows us to identify
actionable insights, make recommendations and help implement solutions that can drive better business decisions and
measurable outcomes for clients. Visa Consulting and Analytics offers consulting services for issuers, acquirers, merchants,
fintechs and other partners, spanning the entire customer journey from acquisition to retention.
We are fortifying the key foundations of our business model, which consist of becoming a network of networks, our
technology platforms, security, brand and talent.
Network of Networks
Visa strives to become a network of networks, offering a single connection point for senders and receivers to enable
money movement to all endpoints and to all form factors, using all available networks.
Technology Platforms
Visa’s technology platforms include software, hardware, data centers and a large telecommunications infrastructure, each
with a distinct architecture and operational footprint wrapped with several layers of security and protection technologies. Visa’s
three data centers are a critical part of our global processing environment and have a high redundancy of network connectivity,
power and cooling designed to provide continuous availability of systems. Together, these systems deliver the secure,
convenient and reliable service that our clients and consumers expect from the Visa brand.
Security
Our in-depth, multi-layer security approach includes a formal program to devalue sensitive and/or personal data through
various cryptographic means; embedded security in the software development lifecycle; identity and access management
controls to protect against unauthorized access; and advanced cyber detection and response capabilities. We deploy
security tools that help keep our clients and consumers safe, while providing buyer and seller solutions that help make Visa the
best way to pay and be paid. We also invest significantly in our comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. We deploy security
technologies to strengthen data confidentiality, integrity and service availability, emphasizing core cybersecurity capabilities to
minimize risk. 
Brand
Visa’s brand strength helps deliver added value to our clients and their customers, financial institutions, merchants and
partners through compelling brand expressions, a wide range of products and services as well as innovative brand and
marketing efforts. In line with our commitment to an expansive and diverse range of partnerships for the benefit of our
stakeholders, Visa is the only brand in the world that is a top sponsor of FIFA, the Olympic Games, and the NFL and is one of
the most active sponsors of women’s football around the world.
This year, we launched a multi-year brand initiative to spotlight the diverse capabilities of our network and our
commitment to enabling global economic inclusion. The “Meet Visa” campaign reintroduced Visa as a network working for
everyone.

Talent
Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally is critical to our continued success. Our workforce grew from
approximately 20,500 in fiscal year 2020 to approximately 21,500 employees in fiscal year 2021. Visa employees are located
in more than 80 countries, with more than 49 percent located outside the U.S. Voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month
attrition) was 9.3 percent as of September 30, 2021. At the end of fiscal year 2021, Visa’s global workforce was 58 percent
male and 42 percent female, and women represented 35 percent of Visa’s leadership (defined as vice president level and
above). In the U.S., ethnicity of our workforce was 41 percent Asian, 7 percent Black, 12 percent Hispanic, 3 percent Other
and 37 percent White. For our U.S. leadership, the breakdown was 20 percent Asian, 6 percent Black, 12 percent Hispanic, 2
percent Other and 59 percent White.
At Visa, we have an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity, and we foster an inclusive workplace to
encourage diversity of thought, culture and background. In 2020, we established “Stand Together” goals in support of social
justice and racial equality in the U.S. focused on our people, our community and our company. We are proud of the progress
we made in fiscal year 2021, including the launch of the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program in the U.S. with the inaugural
class of 50 Visa Black Scholars who will participate in year-round programs and training aimed at developing their professional
and technical skills. Upon graduation, all Scholars who have met their commitments will be offered a full-time job with Visa.
We have also increased the number of underrepresented employees in the U.S. We are supporting Visa’s commitment to
recruit and retain diverse talent by launching employee development programs and partnering with several non-profit and
community organizations, as well as historically black colleges and a generally more diverse set of universities to develop our
talent pipeline. Visa is committed to pay equity, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity, and conducts pay equity analyses on an
annual basis. More details regarding our human capital management, as well as enhanced workforce disclosures that include
our 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 Report and our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report can be found on our
website at usa.visa.com/about-visa/esg.html.
For additional information, please see the section titled “Talent and Human Capital Management” in Visa’s 2021 Proxy
Statement.
FINTECH AND DIGITAL PARTNERSHIPS
Fintechs are key enablers of new payment experiences and new flows. Our work with fintechs has opened new points of
acceptance, extended credit at the point of sale, made cross-border money flows more efficient, moved B2B spend onto Visa’s
network, expedited payroll and provided digital wallet customers access to our services.
To better serve fintechs, Visa has a suite of streamlined commercial programs and digital onboarding tools. Our Fintech
Fast Track program enables qualifying fintechs to quickly launch and scale their programs. The program has welcomed
hundreds of fintechs who are actively engaged in the program.
With our startup engagement programs, the Visa Everywhere Initiative and the Inclusive Fintech 50, early-stage
companies can build payment solutions based on our capabilities. With Visa Fintech Partner Connect, a program launched
globally this year, we are helping our clients tap into innovations emerging from the fintech community. The program is
designed to help financial institutions quickly connect with a vetted and curated set of technology providers, helping Visa’s
issuing partners create digital-first experiences without the cost and complexity of building the back-end technology in-house.
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
Visa continually explores opportunities to augment our capabilities and provide meaningful value to our clients. Mergers
and acquisitions and strategic investments complement our internal development and enhance our partnerships to align with
Visa’s priorities. Visa applies a rigorous business analysis to our acquisitions and investments to ensure they will differentiate
our network, provide value added services and accelerate growth.
In fiscal year 2021, we acquired YellowPepper to accelerate our network of networks strategy in Latin America and the
Caribbean by becoming a single point of access for initiating multiple transaction types and significantly reducing the time-to-
market and cost for issuers and processors to launch card and account agnostic payments solutions.

On June 24, 2021, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Tink AB (Tink), a European open banking platform that
enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build tailored financial management tools, products and services for
European consumers and businesses based on their financial data.
On July 22, 2021, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Currency Cloud Group Limited (Currencycloud), a UK-
based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border
payments. The Tink and Currencycloud transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing
conditions.

protecting the planet; and operating responsibly. Our 2020 ESG report, which provides enhanced ESG disclosures is available
on our website at usa.visa.com/about-visa/esg.html.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own and manage the Visa brand, which stands for acceptance, security, convenience, speed and reliability. Our
portfolio of Visa-owned trademarks is important to our business. Generally, trademark registrations are valid indefinitely as long
as they are in use and/or maintained. We give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and
acquirers, which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network.
Additionally, we have filed patent applications in the U.S. and international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our
proprietary technology and new innovations, and own a number of patents, patent applications and other intellectual property
relating to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology.
COMPETITION
The global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Existing and emerging competitors compete with
Visa’s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants. Technology
and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, blockchain
technology and digital currencies. These advances are enabling new entrants, many of which depart from traditional network
payment models. In certain countries, the evolving regulatory landscape is creating local networks or enabling additional
processing competition.
We compete against all forms of payment. This includes paper-based payments, primarily cash and checks, and all forms
of electronic payments. Our electronic payment competitors principally include:
Global or Multi-Regional Networks: These networks typically offer a range of branded, general purpose card payment
products that consumers can use at millions of merchant locations around the world. Examples include Mastercard, American
Express, Discover, JCB and UnionPay. These competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as
JCB in Japan and Discover in the U.S., or have a leading position in certain countries, such as UnionPay in China. See Item
1A—Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Government-imposed obligations and/or restrictions on international payment systems
may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China, India and
Russia. Based on available data, Visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world.

Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express, Diners Club / Discover, and JCB include business from third-party issuers. JCB figures include other
payment-related products and some figures are estimates.
Local and Regional Networks: Operated in many countries, these networks often have the support of government
influence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by financial institutions or payment processors. These networks typically
focus on debit payment products, and may have strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include STAR,
NYCE, and Pulse in the U.S., Interac in Canada, EFTPOS in Australia and Mir in Russia.
Alternative Payment Providers: These providers such as digital wallets, closed commerce ecosystems, BNPL
solutions, cryptocurrency platforms, and account-to-account systems often have a primary focus of enabling payments through
ecommerce and mobile channels; however, they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale.
These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks
like the ACH, global or local networks like Visa, or some combination of the foregoing. In some cases, these entities are both a
partner and a competitor to Visa.
ACH and RTP Networks: These networks are often governed by local regulations. Primarily focused on interbank
transfers, many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments. We also compete with
closed-loop payment systems, emerging payments networks, wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers.
Payment Processors: We compete with payment processors for the processing of Visa transactions. These processors
may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation. For example, as a result of regulation
in Europe under the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), we may face competition from other networks, processors and other
third parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.
Value Added Products and Service Providers: We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our
value added products and services, including information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and
insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments and technology companies that provide cyber and fraud
solutions. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.
We believe our fundamental value proposition of security, convenience, speed and reliability as well as the number of
credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed. In addition, we understand the needs of the individual markets in
which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, fintechs, governments, NGOs and business
organizations to provide tailored and innovative solutions. Our network of networks strategy implies that we have and we will
continue to utilize other networks to facilitate the movement of money. We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively due to
our global brand, our broad set of payment products and value added services, and our proven track record of processing
payment transactions securely and reliably.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various
jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most significant government regulations that impact our
business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A-Risk
Factors-Regulatory Risks.
Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions: We are subject to anti-corruption laws and
regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit
the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or
retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also(1)
(1)
14
Table of Contents
subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In
addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or
territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Crimea), or that are
included on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire Visa cards or engage in
transactions using our services.
Government-Imposed Market Participation Restrictions: Certain governments, including China, India, Indonesia,
Russia, Thailand and Vietnam, have taken actions to promote domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments
networks or processors, by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers, impose local ownership requirements on
processors, require data localization or mandate that domestic processing be done in that country.
Interchange Rates and Fees: An increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and
credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Act (Dodd-Frank Act) limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions in the U.S., the European
Union (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in Europe (as discussed below), and the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Central
Bank of Brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange.
Internet Transactions: Many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payment system participants to monitor,
identify, filter, restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as
gambling, digital currencies, the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol and other controversial transaction types.
Network Exclusivity and Routing: In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusivity and restrictions on
merchant routing choice for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the
IFR’s prohibition in Europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card.
No-surcharge Rules: We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to
consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. However, merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by
geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation and legislation.
Privacy and Data Protection: Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy, data use and data security
regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data, operate our products and services and even impact our ability to
offer a product or service. In addition, regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require Visa to adopt certain
cybersecurity and data-handling practices, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on
companies handling personal data.
Supervisory Oversight of the Payments Industry: Visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in
substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., for example, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council (FFIEC) has supervisory oversight over Visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology
service provider to U.S. financial institutions. The federal banking agencies comprising the FFIEC are the Federal Reserve
Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union
Administration. Visa also may be separately examined by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection as a service provider
to the banks that issue Visa-branded consumer credit and debit card products. Central banks in other countries/regions,
including Europe, India, Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom (as discussed below), have recognized or designated Visa
as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations. Visa is also subject to oversight by banking
and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Brazil and Hong Kong.
European and United Kingdom Regulations and Supervisory Oversight: Visa in Europe continues to be subject to
complex and evolving regulation in the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (EEA). Specifically, in the United
Kingdom, Visa Europe is designated as a Recognized Payment System, bringing it within the scope of the Bank of England’s
supervisory powers and subject to various requirements, including on issues such as governance and risk management
designed to maintain the stability of the United Kingdom’s financial system. Visa Europe is also regulated by the United
Kingdom’s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), which has wide-ranging powers and authority to review our business practices,
systems, rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the United Kingdom, and ensuring payments
meet account holder needs.

Table of Contents
Furthermore, there are a number of EU regulations that impact our business. As discussed above, the IFR regulates
interchange rates within Europe, requires Visa Europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing
activities for accounting, organization, and decision-making purposes within the EU and imposes limitations on network
exclusivity and routing. National competent authorities in the EU are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the IFR in their
markets. We are also subject to regulations governing privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-
terrorism and sanctions. Other regulations in Europe, such as the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), require, among
other things, that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging non-financial
institution players. PSD2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose
both operational complexity on Visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences.
Post-Brexit, the United Kingdom has adopted various European regulations, including regulations that impact the
payments ecosystem such as the IFR and PSD2. The PSR is responsible for monitoring Visa Europe’s compliance with the
IFR as adopted in the United Kingdom.
ESG and Sustainability: Certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to ESG
performance, transparency and reporting. Regulations may include mandated corporate reporting on ESG overall (e.g., EU
Sustainable Reporting Directive) or in individual areas such as mandated reporting on climate-related financial disclosures.
Additional Regulatory Developments: Various regulatory agencies across the world also continue to examine a wide
variety of other issues, including mobile payment transactions, tokenization, access rights for non-financial institutions, money
transfer services, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security and marketing that could affect our
financial institution clients and our business. Furthermore, following the passage of PSD2 in Europe, several countries,
including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and Mexico, are contemplating granting or have already granted various types
of access rights to third party processors, including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution
clients. These changes could have negative implications for our business depending on how the regulations are framed and
implemented.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
Regulatory Risks
We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.
As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our
operations. See Item 1—Business—Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation
that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to
enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules; affect our existing contractual
arrangements; increase our compliance costs; require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third
parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner; and reduce our revenue opportunities. As discussed in more detail
below, we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic
processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection,
licensing requirements, and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa operating rules and our other contractual
commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases
our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities. Our diversification into new product offerings and participation in new
flows could also introduce new licensing and other regulatory obligations that impact our business.
If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings,
services, fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate. Our compliance programs and
policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering,
anti-corruption, competition, money transfer services, privacy and sanctions, and we continually enhance our compliance
programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable
regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could
be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, litigation, investigations and proceedings, and damage to our
global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could
negatively impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, our revenues,
our brands, our competitive positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, the
quality and types of products and services we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers
and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business.
Increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange
reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related
practices, could harm our business.
Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the
payments industry. See Item 1—Business —Government Regulation for more information. In the U.S. and many other
jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receive any
revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions,
those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the reverse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange
reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important
determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by
mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues.
Interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased
government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are
reviewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example, regulations adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve cap the maximum
U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per
transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits issuers’ and our ability to adopt network
exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business. Earlier this year, the Federal
Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would, among other things, require issuers to ensure that at least two
networks are available for routing card not present debit transactions. Various stakeholder groups are also advocating that the
Federal Reserve further lower interchange fees on debit transactions and restrict the ability of payments networks to enter
17
Table of Contents
into certain incentive and growth agreements with issuers. In addition, there continues to be interest in further regulation of
interchange fees and routing practices by members of Congress and state legislators in the U.S. The EU’s IFR places an
effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross-border transactions within
the EEA (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively). EU member states have the ability to further reduce these
interchange levels within their territories. The European Commission concluded its impact assessment of the IFR, indicating
that while it does not intend to expand the legislation at this time, it will continue to monitor market dynamics. Countries in
other parts of the world, including the Latin America region, have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps. For
example, in March 2017, Argentina’s central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit
transactions. In March 2018, Brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions and in March 2020, the Congress in Costa
Rica passed legislation allowing the Central Bank to regulate interchange and other fees. This trend to regulate pricing
continued in Latin America in 2021, when the President in Chile signed legislation to create a committee to set interchange
caps. Finally, in Australia, the Reserve Bank completed its review of the country’s payment system regulations and made a
series of preliminary recommendations including, to further lower interchange rates for debit transactions, and set expectations
for issuers and acquirers in the country to support greater issuance and acceptance of dual-badged debit cards and allow
merchant choice routing on certain transactions.
When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our
payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors’
closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react
to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to consumers, which make our products less
appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher MDR regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement
rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternative payments systems or forms of
payment. In addition, in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained,
and may continue to obtain, incentives from us, including reductions in the fees that we charge, which may directly impact our
revenues.
In addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees, a number of regulators impose restrictions on other
aspects of our payments business. For example, many governments including, but not limited to governments in India and
Turkey are using regulation to further drive down MDR, which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions. Some
countries in Latin America, like Peru and Chile are relying on antitrust-driven regulatory actions that can have implications for
how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate. The PSR’s review of the acquiring market in the United Kingdom
could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business. With increased merchant lobbying, we could also begin to see
regulatory interest in network fees. Government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks
to support Visa products or services, or to have the other network’s functionality or brand marks on our products. As
innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have also expanded the
potential scope of regulatory influence. For instance, new products and capabilities, including tokenization, push payments,
and non-card based payment flows (e.g., Visa B2B Connect) could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in
the countries where the product or capability is offered. In addition, the EU’s requirement to separate scheme and processing
adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies.
We are also subject to central bank oversight in a growing number of countries, including, Brazil, India, Russia, the United
Kingdom and within the EU. Furthermore, some countries with existing oversight frameworks are looking to further enhance
their regulatory powers. This oversight could result in new governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing
infrastructure, capital, or credit risk management requirements. We could also be required to adopt policies and practices
designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and
financial resources locally, as well as localized risk management or governance. Increased oversight could also include new
criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system. Additionally, regulators in other jurisdictions
are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles.
Regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry.
Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. The risks created by a new
law, regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our
business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. For example, our settlement with the European Commission on
cross-border interchange rates has drawn some preliminary attention of regulators in other parts of the world. Similarly, new
regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For
example, credit payments could become subject to similar regulation
18
Table of Contents
as debit payments (or vice versa). For instance, the Reserve Bank of Australia initially capped credit interchange, but
subsequently capped debit interchange as well.
Government-imposed obligations and/or restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from
competing against providers in certain countries, including significant markets such as China, India and Russia.
Governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks, brands, and processors from
international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations. To varying degrees, these
policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international
payments networks. Public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that
domestic payments or data processing be performed entirely within that country, which could prevent us from managing the
end-to-end processing of certain transactions.
In Russia, legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions. The central bank controlled national
payment card system (NSPK) is the only entity allowed to process domestically. In China, UnionPay remains the sole
processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Although we have filed an
application with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, the timing
and the procedural steps for approval remain uncertain. The approval process might require several years, and there is no
guarantee that the license to operate a BCCI will be approved or, if we obtain such license, that we will be able to successfully
compete with domestic payments networks.
Regulatory initiatives in India also suggest growing nationalistic priorities, including a data localization mandate passed by
the government, which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment
providers. Furthermore, any inability to meet the requirements of the data localization mandate could impact our ability to do
business in India. In Europe, with the support of the European Central Bank, a group of European banks have announced their
intent to launch a pan-European payment system, the European Payments Initiative or EPI, with the purported intent to reduce
the risks of disintermediation by international technology companies and continued reliance on international payments
networks for intra-Europe card transactions. Furthermore, regional groups of countries, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) and a number of countries in Southeast Asia, are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our participation in the
processing of regional transactions. The African Development Bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national
payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability. Finally, some countries
such as South Africa are mandating on-shore processing of domestic transactions. Geopolitical events, including sanctions,
trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify any or all of these activities, which could adversely affect
our business.
Due to our inability to manage the end-to-end processing of transactions for cards in certain countries (e.g., Russia and
Thailand), we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third-party processors to ensure transactions
involving our products are processed effectively. Our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and
policies pertaining to transaction routing or on-shore processing.
Co-badging and co-residency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where Visa competes with national
networks for issuance and routing. For example, in China, certain banks have issued dual-branded cards for which domestic
transactions in China are processed by UnionPay and transactions outside of China are processed by us or other international
payments networks. The PBOC is contemplating that dual-branded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are
issued to international companies to participate in China’s domestic payments market. Accordingly, we have been working with
Chinese issuers to issue Visa-only branded cards for international travel, and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a
BCCI license. However, notwithstanding such efforts, the phase out of dual-branded cards may decrease our payment
volumes and impact the revenue we generate in China. Furthermore, as discussed above, Australia is contemplating
additional requirements to mandate dual-badged or co-badged cards that support the local domestic debit network, Eftpos.
Mir and UnionPay have grown rapidly in Russia and China, respectively, and are actively pursuing international
expansion plans, which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule (which requires that
international transactions on Visa cards be routed over VisaNet). Furthermore, although regulatory barriers shield Mir and
UnionPay from competition in Russia and China, respectively, alternative payment providers such as Alipay and WeChat Pay
have rapidly expanded into ecommerce, offline, and cross-border payments, which could make it difficult for us to compete
even if our license is approved in China. NetsUnion Clearing Corp, a
19
Table of Contents
Chinese digital transaction routing system, and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with
international payments networks.
Finally, central banks in a number of countries, including those in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada and Russia, are in
the process of developing or expanding national real-time payments networks with the goal of driving a greater number of
domestic transactions onto these systems. Similarly, an increasing number of jurisdictions are exploring the concept of building
central bank digital currencies for retail payments. If successfully deployed, these national payment platforms and digital
currencies could have significant implications for Visa’s domestic and cross-border payments, including potential
disintermediation.
In general, national laws that protect or otherwise support domestic providers or processing may increase our costs;
decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries; decrease the number of Visa
products issued or processed; impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the
services supporting our brands; restrict our activities; limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products, services and
innovations; force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets; and create new competitors, all of which
could harm our business.
Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in
increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.
Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders.
Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data
continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. For example, in July 2020 the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled to invalidate the U.S./EU Privacy Shield — a legal framework that allowed
participating companies to transfer personal data from EU member states to the U.S. Visa has never used the Privacy Shield
framework for its transfers, and relies instead on standard contractual clauses. However, the CJEU ruling made clear that
these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny as well. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data
protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting
requirements. For example, the EU’s and UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) extends the scope of the EU and
UK data protection law to all companies processing data of EU and UK residents, regardless of the company’s location. The
law requires companies to comply with a broad range of requirements regarding the handling of personal information. Although
we have a global data privacy program that addresses the requirements applicable to our international business, our ongoing
efforts to comply with GDPR and rapidly emerging privacy and data protection laws in countries such as India or states in the
U.S. such as Colorado and Virginia may increase the complexity of our compliance operations, entail substantial expenses,
divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer.
Furthermore, inconsistent local and regional regulations restricting location, movement, collection, use and management
of data may limit our ability to innovate or compete in certain jurisdictions. For example, China adopted its first comprehensive
privacy law, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which took effect in November 2021. Although certain details of
PIPL may require further regulatory clarification or guidance, Visa could be impacted more significantly if our license is
approved and we begin conducting domestic bank card clearing activity in China. Lastly, enforcement actions and
investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The
enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through
increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal
liability.
We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws.
We exercise significant judgment and make estimates in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other
tax liabilities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently
under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the UK’s HM Revenue and Customs as well as
tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax
authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain
our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws in the U.S.
or foreign jurisdictions, including unilateral actions of foreign jurisdictions to introduce digital services taxes, or changes
resulting from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Programme of Work, related to the revision of
profit allocation and nexus rules and design of a system to ensure multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax to
20
Table of Contents
the countries where we earn revenue, may also materially affect our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax
payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Litigation Risks
We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations, despite certain protections that are in
place.
We are involved in numerous litigation matters, investigations, and proceedings asserted by civil litigants, governments,
and enforcement bodies investigating or alleging, among other things, violations of competition and antitrust law, consumer
protection law, privacy law and intellectual property law (these are referred to as “actions” in this section). Details of the most
significant actions we face are described more fully in Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. These actions are inherently uncertain,
expensive and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable in any material action, particularly in a large class
action lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the U.S., or we incur liability
arising from a government investigation, we may be required to pay significant awards, settlements or fines. In addition,
settlement terms, judgments, orders or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by influencing or requiring us
to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in
which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also
influence regulators, investigators, governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions, which may lead to additional
actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation
brought against them, even if Visa is not a defendant.
For certain actions like those that are U.S. covered litigation or VE territory covered litigation, as described in Note 5—
U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we have certain financial protections
pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the
protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospective
responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could
materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent.
Business Risks
We face intense competition in our industry.
The global payments space is intensely competitive. As technology evolves, new competitors or methods of payment
emerge, and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic
funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other domestic and closed-loop payments systems, and
alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global
payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment providers
such as fintechs, other digital payments, technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through
online activity in ecommerce, social media, and mobile channels, as well as governments in a number of jurisdictions (e.g.
Brazil, India and Russia), that are developing, supporting and/or operating national schemes, real time payments networks and
other payment platforms.
Our competitors may acquire or develop substantially better technology, have more widely adopted delivery channels or
have greater financial resources. They may offer more effective, innovative or a wider range of programs, products and
services. They may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition, and
greater use, including with respect to issuance and merchant acceptance. They may also develop better security solutions or
more favorable pricing arrangements. Moreover, even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of
alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas, such services may provide
less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from VisaNet transactions, which could hurt our financial results
and prospects.
Certain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate in different
market segments. Those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to
21
Table of Contents
regulatory, technological and other developments. In some cases, these competitors have the support of government
mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions.
Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers,
technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternative payments systems like Alipay and
WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. Government
actions or initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act, the IFR in Europe, or real time payment initiatives by governments such as
the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FedNow or the Central Bank of Brazil’s Pix system may provide competitors with increased
opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models, and may create new competitors, including in
some cases the government itself. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and the IFR may require us to open up access
to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory
burden on competitors. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies and platforms,
including mobile payments, alternative payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by virtue of
increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions. For
example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with
issuers and acquirers.
We expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example:
•we, along with our competitors, clients, network participants, and others are developing or participating in alternative
payments systems or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment
services, real-time and faster payment initiatives, and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from or to
consumer checking accounts, that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction
processing or the value added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The
Clearing House, an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments
system; Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another
platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and
government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and cryptocurrency or stablecoin-based payments
initiatives.
•similarly, many countries are developing or promoting domestic networks, switches and real-time payment systems
(e.g. India, Russia, as well as Europe). To the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use
and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions, prohibit international payments networks, like Visa, from
participating on those systems, and/or impose restrictions or prohibitions, on international payments networks from
offering payment services on such transactions, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those
countries. For example, in Argentina, the government has mandated local acquirers to use debit card credentials to
initiate payment transactions on a government-sponsored national real-time payment system. Furthermore, in some
regions (e.g., Southeast Asia; the Middle East), through intergovernmental organizations such as the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and the GCC, some countries are looking into cross-border connectivity of such domestic
systems;
•parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain;
•parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers
or others might be able to migrate or steer account holders and other clients to alternative payment methods or use
our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and
platforms;
•participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business
combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; and
•new or revised industry standards related to online checkout and web payments, cloud-based payments, tokenization
or other payments-related technologies set by individual countries, regions or organizations such as the International
Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, World Wide Web Consortium, European Card
Standards Group, PCI Co, Nexo and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or
otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.

As the competitive landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks
associated with new businesses, products, services and practices. We may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices,
develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services, or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective
of Visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of
litigation concerning intellectual property. Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our
business and prospects for future growth.
Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and
develop.
Our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own
competitive services. While we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally
have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to
terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a
significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these
larger clients could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For more information, please see Note 14
—Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
In addition, we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. In order to stay
competitive, we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new
market segments, adapt to regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. These
include up-front cash payments, fee discounts, rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing, and other support
payments that impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win
routing preference in relation to other network options or forms of payment. Market pressures on pricing, incentives, fee
discounts, and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives
in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these
incentives, fee discounts, and rebates, it may harm our net revenues and profits.
In addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that
have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These financial institutions or merchants
may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a
consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or
merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which
could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business.
Merchants’ and processors’ continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm
our business.
We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the use and acceptance of
Visa products. Certain merchants and merchant-affiliated groups have been exerting their influence in the global payments
system in certain jurisdictions, such as the U.S., Canada and Europe, to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying
for new legislation, seeking regulatory intervention, filing lawsuits and in some cases, refusing to accept Visa products. If they
are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses, issuers may decrease their issuance
of our products, and consumer usage of our products could be adversely impacted. For example, in the U.S., certain
stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and
the cost of payment card acceptance. In addition to ongoing litigation related to the U.S. migration to EMV-capable cards and
point-of-sale terminals, U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the EMV
certification process and some policymakers have expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as EMVCo and
the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in the development of payment card standards. Additionally, some
merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and Visa acceptance requirements at the point of
sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated
transactions, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose
surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adversely
impact consumers’ usage of our products, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, increase our compliance and
litigation expenses, and harm our business.

We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, payment facilitators,
ecommerce platforms, fintechs and other third parties.
As noted above, our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of
multiple third parties. For instance, we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their
relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services, and thereby compete effectively in
the marketplace. We engage in discussions with merchants, acquirers, ecommerce platforms and processors to provide
incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth. We also engage in many payment card co-branding efforts
with merchants, who receive incentives from us. As emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry, we
engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem, whether as, for example, an issuer, merchant,
ecommerce platform or digital wallet provider. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater
importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In
addition, we depend on our clients and third parties, including network partners, vendors and suppliers, to submit, facilitate and
process transactions properly, provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and otherwise
adhere to our operating rules and applicable laws. To the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services, it
may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their Visa-branded payment products, which
could harm our business and reputation.
Our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the
potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation.
Our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business. We believe that our clients and account holders
associate our brand with acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. Our success depends in large part on our
ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the
brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The popularity of
products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to
cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the point-of-sale and decrease the value of our brand. Our brand
reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including authorization, clearing and settlement service
disruptions; data security breaches; compliance failures by Visa, including our employees, agents, clients, partners or
suppliers; failure to meet our environmental, social and governance goals; negative perception of our industry, the industries of
our clients, Visa-accepting merchants, or our clients’ customers, including third party payments providers; ill-perceived actions
or affiliations by clients, partners or other third parties, such as sponsorship or co-brand partners; and fraudulent, controversial
or illegal activities using our payment products. If we are unable to maintain our reputation, the value of our brand may be
impaired, which could harm our relationships with clients, account holders, governments and the public, as well as impact our
business.
Global economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions, including the ongoing effects of the
coronavirus pandemic, may harm our business.
More than half of our net revenues are earned outside the U.S. International cross-border transaction revenues represent
a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Our revenues are dependent on the volume
and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be
affected by prevailing economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions,
including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures,
or a slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, small business,
government, and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses,
pandemics like COVID-19, or other local or global health issues, political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conflict,
or unrest, climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, and natural disasters could
have similar impacts on our operations, clients, third-party suppliers, activities in a particular location or globally, and cross-
border travel and spend. Geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as
continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions, tariffs or trade restrictions could limit the expansion of our
business in those regions. In addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to
accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments may
implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may impose new expectations or focus investments in ways that
cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business.
As a result of any of these factors, any decline in cross-
24
Table of Contents
border travel and spend could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our currency exchange
activities, which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues.
A decline in economic, political, market, health and social conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions
could reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues.
They may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on
optional or enhanced value added services from us. Any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial
markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs
and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital
resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. If clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our
liquidity. Any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue.
The ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the
transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak; new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of
health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health
authorities, including vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of
borders and the resumption of international travel; and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our
clients, suppliers and business partners; and other factors such as:
•third party disruptions, including potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers;
•increased consumer dispute volumes due to travel or event cancellations and the speed or accuracy in processing
refunds;
•increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt DDoS related attacks, phishing scams and other
disruptive actions, given the shift to online banking, ecommerce and other online activity, as well as more employees
working remotely as a result of the ongoing pandemic;
•challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the
possibility of one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases occurring at our data centers, affecting our employees, or
affecting the systems or employees of our issuers, acquirers or merchants;
•additional regulatory requirements, including, for example, government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate
payments fees or other costs. A number of countries have taken steps to temporarily cap interchange or other fees on
electronic payments as part of their COVID-19 economic relief measures. It is possible that some or all of these caps
may become permanent over time, or that we see governments introduce additional and/or new pricing caps in future
economic relief initiatives. In addition, proponents of interchange and/or MDR regulation may try to position
government intervention as necessary to support recovery efforts. In an overall soft global economy, such pricing
measures could result in additional financial pressures on our business; and
•workforce impacts, such as difficulty recruiting, retaining, training, motivating and developing employees due to
evolving health and safety protocols; changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible
work models; restrictions on immigration, travel and employee mobility; and the challenges of maintaining our strong
corporate culture, which values communication, collaboration and connections, despite a majority of employees
working from home.
Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may
reduce our liquidity.
We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer
to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers
or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for
us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our
indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa card payment transactions at any point in time
and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions. Concurrent
settlement failures or insolvencies involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients, or systemic
operational failures could negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement
failure or insolvency, we may
25
Table of Contents
be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses and harm our business. See
Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Technology and Cybersecurity Risks
Failure to anticipate, adapt to, or keep pace with, new technologies in the payments industry could harm our
business and impact future growth.
The global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including mobile and other
proximity and in-app payment technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain
technologies, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, 3D Secure 2.0 and dynamic cardholder verification
values or dCVV2. As a result, we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, including those
developed by Visa such as our cross-border B2B payment service, Visa B2B Connect. In addition to our own initiatives and
innovations, we work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, for the development of, and access to, new
technologies. It is difficult, however, to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted
and how those technologies may be regulated. Moreover, some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual
property-related lawsuits or claims, potentially impacting our development efforts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses. If we or
our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our
ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing
rights, harm our business and impact our future growth.
A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our
business.
Our cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of financial institutions, merchants, and third-party service
providers, have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage from
a number of causes, including power outages, hardware, software and network failures, computer viruses, malware or other
destructive software, internal design, manual or user errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing,
catastrophic events, natural disasters, severe weather conditions and other effects from climate change. In addition, there is
risk that third party suppliers of hardware and infrastructure required to operate our data centers and support employee
productivity could be impacted by supply chain disruptions, such as manufacturing and shipping delays. An extended supply
chain disruption could also impact processing or delivery of technology services.
Furthermore, our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being
targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. We
have been, and may continue to be, impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions, merchants, or
third-party processors. We are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our
financial institution clients, and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security
breaches affecting their customers, some of whom were Visa account holders. Such attacks and breaches have resulted, and
may continue to result in, fraudulent activity and ultimately, financial losses to Visa’s clients, and it is difficult to predict the
direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business.
Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social
engineering schemes, particularly on our internet-facing applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and
integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our third-party service providers. Because the techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and
sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or
timely. The security measures and procedures we, our financial institution and merchant clients, other merchants and third-
party service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may
not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. In some cases, the
mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards, who may not
be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or fix security defects, or whose hardware, software or network services may be subject
to error, defect, delay, outage or lack appropriate malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exfiltration incidents.
Although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity, acquired entities, and supplier risk management
26
Table of Contents
programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to
data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.
These events could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers; damage our reputation and
brand; result in litigation or claims, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and increased regulatory review or scrutiny,
investigations, actions, fines or penalties; result in damages or changes to our business practices; decrease the overall use
and acceptance of our products; decrease our volume, revenues and future growth prospects; and be costly, time consuming
and difficult to remedy. In the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to
successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data through our business continuity
program. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that
may arise.
Structural and Organizational Risks
We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments, and may face risks and
uncertainties as a result.
As part of our overall business strategy, we make acquisitions and strategic investments. We may not achieve the
anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and
uncertainties, including:
•disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and management’s attention from our existing
business;
•greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses;
•failure to adequately develop our acquired entities;
•the data security, cybersecurity and operational resilience posture of our acquired entities, or companies we invest in
or partner with, may not be adequate and may be more susceptible to cyber incidents;
•difficulty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures and policies at the acquired entities;
•challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technologies;
•failure to retain employees, clients or partners of our acquired entities;
•in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and
languages;
•disruptions, costs, liabilities, judgments, settlements or business pressures resulting from litigation matters,
investigations or legal proceedings involving the acquisitions or strategic investments;
•the inability to pursue aspects of the acquired entities due to outcomes in litigation matters, investigations or legal
proceedings;
•failure to obtain the necessary government or other approvals at all, on a timely basis or without the imposition of
burdensome conditions or restrictions;
•the economic, political, regulatory and compliance risks associated with entering into a new business or operating in
new regions or countries. For more information on regulatory risks, please see Item 1—Business—Government
Regulations and Item 1A—Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks above;
•discovery of unidentified issues and related liabilities after the acquisition or investment was made;
•failure to mitigate the deficiencies and liabilities of the acquired entities;
•dilutive issuance of equity securities, if new securities are issued;
•the incurrence of debt;
•negative impact on our financial position and/or statement of operations; and
•anticipated benefits, synergies or value of the investment or acquisition not materializing.

We may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management.
The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. The market for highly
skilled workers and leaders in our industry, especially in fintech, technology and other specialized areas, is extremely
competitive. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to
retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive
with the rest of the labor market. Ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations have
made it more difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which we have operations and could
continue to impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain
highly qualified and diverse employee talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture, including
increasing the number of underrepresented employees in the U.S.; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for
the management team; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and
successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could
disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. These challenges may be further amplified by
the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The conversions of our class B and class C common stock or series A, B and C preferred stock into shares of class A
common stock would result in voting dilution to, and could impact the market price of, our existing class A common
stock.
The market price of our class A common stock could fall as a result of many factors. The value of our class B and C
common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock is tied to the value of the class A common stock. Under our U.S.
retrospective responsibility plan, upon final resolution of our U.S. covered litigation, all class B common stock will become
convertible into class A common stock. In September 2020, we released $7.3 billion of the as-converted value from our series
B and series C preferred stock and issued series A preferred stock in connection with that release. Visa will continue to
release value from the series B and series C preferred stock in stages based on developments in current and potential
litigation under our Europe retrospective responsibility plan. The series B and series C preferred stock will become fully
convertible to series A preferred stock or class A common stock no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any
pending claims). Visa may take action on the class B common stock and series B and C preferred stock at a certain valuation
and due to unforeseen circumstances the overall value of the class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred
stock as determined by the class A common stock price, may later decrease. Conversion of our class B and class C common
stock into class A common stock, or our series A, B and C preferred stock into class A common stock, would increase the
amount of class A common stock outstanding, which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class A common
stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class A common stockholders.
Holders of our class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock may have different interests than
our class A common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions.
Although their voting rights are limited, holders of our class B and C common stock and, in certain specified
circumstances, holders of our series A, B and C preferred stock, can vote on certain significant transactions. With respect to
our class B and C common stock, these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger, a decision to exit our core
payments business and any other vote required under Delaware law. With respect to our series A, B and C preferred stock,
voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series A, B and C preferred stock would
receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to
the preferences, rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock; or, in the case of series B and C preferred
stock, holders would receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what our class A common stockholders
would receive. Because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class A common stock are our current and former
financial institution clients, they may have interests that diverge from our class A common stockholders. As a result, the
holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable
to the holders of class A common stock, and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class A common
stockholders.

Table of Contents
Delaware law, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our capital structure could make a
merger, takeover attempt, or change in control difficult.
Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a
merger, takeover attempt, or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, except for limited
exceptions:
•no person may beneficially own more than 15 percent of our class A common stock (or 15 percent of our total
outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such
shares in advance;
•no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5 percent of our total outstanding common stock on
an as-converted basis;
•the affirmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock are required for certain
types of consolidations or mergers;
•our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders’ meeting and may not act by written consent; and
•only the board of directors, Chairman, or CEO or any stockholders who have owned continuously for at least one year
not less than 15 percent of the voting power of all shares of class A common stock outstanding may call a special
meeting of stockholders.

ITEM 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities
Our class A common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “V” since March 19, 2008.
At November 10, 2021, we had 330 stockholders of record of our class A common stock. The number of beneficial owners is
substantially greater than the number of record holders, because a large portion of our class A common stock is held in “street
name” by banks and brokers. There is currently no established public trading market for our class B or C common stock. As of
November 10, 2021, there were 1,243 and 435 holders of record of our class B and C common stock, respectively.
On October 22, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.375 per share of class A common
stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock
on an as-converted basis) payable on December 7, 2021, to holders of record as of November 12, 2021 of our common and
preferred stock.
Subject to legally available funds, we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding common and
preferred stock in the future. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of
directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement indemnifications, operating
results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

As of September 30, 2021, the maximum number of shares issuable consisted of 6 million outstanding options, 5 million outstanding restricted stock units
and 1 million outstanding performance shares under the EIP and less than 1 million outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP.
The weighted-average exercise price is calculated based solely on the exercise prices of the outstanding stock options and does not reflect the shares that
will be issued upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and performance shares, which have no exercise price. Additionally, it excludes the
weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP, as the exercise price is based on the future stock price, net of
discount, at the end of each monthly purchase over the offering period.
As of September 30, 2021, 98 million shares and 15 million shares remain available for issuance under the EIP and the ESPP, respectively.

Coronavirus. As the effects of an evolving coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues, much remains uncertain. Our
priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a
phased approach to reopening our offices, with most of our employees currently working remotely. We continue to remain in
close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these
challenging times.
The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility,
severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak; new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety
measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities,
including vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of borders and
the resumption of international travel; and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients,
suppliers and business partners; and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. We will
continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.
Highlights for fiscal 2021. Net revenues were $24.1 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, primarily due to the
year-over-year growth in payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume, helped by(1)

Table of Contents
fewer COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives. Exchange rate movements and our hedging program
positively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.
GAAP operating expenses were $8.3 billion and increased 7% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel
and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were
$8.1 billion and increased 5% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing expenses, partially offset
by lower general and administrative expenses. Exchange rate movements negatively impacted our operating expense growth
by approximately half a percentage point.
Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which
we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may
distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater
transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.
•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value
adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature
and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these
investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the
underlying performance of our business.
•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of
intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with
business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are
non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core
operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current
operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.
•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs
associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees,
restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also
includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price
of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts
and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying
performance of our business.
•Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2021, in connection with the UK enacted legislation on June
10, 2021 that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023, we remeasured our UK deferred tax
liabilities, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $1.0 billion.
During fiscal 2020, in connection with the UK enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from
19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020, we remeasured our UK deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment
date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $329 million. See Note 19—
Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data of this report.
•Indirect taxes. During fiscal 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152
million, before tax. Net of the related income tax benefit of $40 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates,
non-GAAP net income increased by $112 million. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect
taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-
time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations.
•Resolution of a tax item. During fiscal 2020, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, dating back more than 12
years, relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering. The resolution of this matter
resulted in the recognition of a one-time charge to income tax expense of $28 million, which we believe is not
representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate.

Table of Contents
•Litigation provision. During fiscal 2019, we recorded a litigation provision of $370 million and related tax benefits of $83
million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable
federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the
monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B
common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data of this report.
Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net

Common stock repurchases. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized an $8.0 billion share repurchase program
(the “January 2021 Program”). During fiscal 2021, we repurchased 40 million shares of our class A common stock in the open
market for $8.7 billion. As of September 30, 2021, our January 2021 Program had remaining authorized funds of $4.8 billion
for share repurchase. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Pending acquisitions. On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink AB (“Tink”) for €1.8
billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including
regulatory reviews and approvals.
On July 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Currency Cloud Group Limited
(“Currencycloud”). The acquisition values Currencycloud at £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The
financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that we already own. This acquisition is
subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals.
Terminated acquisition. On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid Inc. mutually terminated their merger agreement announced
on January 13, 2020. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the
number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues.
Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying
the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is
denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate
for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and
other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.(1) (1)

Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12
months ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12
months ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates
are not material.
Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume.
Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.
Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks.
Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients,
subject to review by Visa.

Results of Operations
Net Revenues
Our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as
well as the number of transactions processed on our network. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further
discussion on the components of our net revenues.

Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
Net revenues increased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the year-over-year growth in payments volume, processed
transactions and cross-border volume, helped by fewer COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives.
Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and
related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2021, exchange rate movements and
our hedging program positively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.

•Service revenues increased primarily due to 14% growth in nominal payments volume. Service revenues were also
impacted by select pricing modifications and business mix.
•Data processing revenues increased due to 17% growth in processed transactions, as the business laps the initial
impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020.
•International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding
transactions within Europe, of 4%, as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and
border restrictions were relaxed in various markets.
•Other revenues increased as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020, driven by
higher consulting and data services revenues.
•Client incentives increased in conjunction with the increase in payments volume during fiscal 2021. The amount of
client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client
performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of the following:
•Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation,
contractor expense and severance charges.
•Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other
related promotions of the Visa brand.
•Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including
maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services.
•Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services.
•Depreciation and amortization expenses include amortization of purchased and internally developed software, as well
as depreciation expense for property and equipment. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived
intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions.
•General and administrative expenses consist mainly of card benefits, indirect taxes, facilities costs, travel and meeting
costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business.
•Litigation provision represents litigation expenses and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation
profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of
incurred loss.

Operating expenses for fiscal 2021 and 2019 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. See Overview
within this Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
•Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount and incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy
to invest in future growth.
•Marketing expenses increased as we lapped reductions in spending in the prior year at the outset of COVID-19 as well
as higher spending in client marketing and various campaigns, including the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, which were
held in Summer 2021.
•General and administrative expenses decreased due to lower travel expenses, favorable foreign currency fluctuations
and lower usage of travel related card benefits, partially offset by a one-time charge to record our estimate of probable
additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in
applicable laws.
Non-operating Income (Expense)
Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments, income
from derivative instruments not associated with our core business, as well as the non-service components of net periodic
pension income and expense.

an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of debt in fiscal 2020. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
•Investment income and other increased primarily due to higher gains from our equity investments, partially offset by
lower interest income on our cash and investments. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our

Effective Income Tax Rate
The following table presents our effective income tax rates:
 For the Years Ended
September 30,
 2021 2020 2019
Effective income tax rate 23 % 21 % 19 %
The effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 mainly due to the following:
•during fiscal 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax
liabilities, as discussed below;
•during fiscal 2021, $255 million of tax benefits recognized as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities;
and
•during fiscal 2020, a $329 million non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred
tax liabilities, as discussed below.
On June 10, 2021, the UK enacted legislation that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. On
July 22, 2020, the UK enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on
April 1, 2020. As a result, in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we recorded non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the
remeasurement of our UK deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe
Limited (“Visa Europe”) in fiscal 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Management of Our Liquidity
We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital
expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or
equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner
consistent with our corporate objectives.
The objectives of our treasury policies are to:
•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;
•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities;
•ensure payments on required litigation settlements;
•make planned capital investments in our business;
•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and
•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional
income.
Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our
current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12
months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating
performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.

Cash Flow Data
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:
For the Years Ended

 (in millions)
Total cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 15,227 $ 10,440 $ 12,784

Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents $ 628 $ 8,339 $ (145)
Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due
to growth in our underlying business, lower client incentive payments and timing and impact of COVID-19 on settlement in the
prior fiscal year.
Investing activities. Cash was used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash provided by investing activities
in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher purchases, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities.
Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to
the absence of proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in the prior year, the $3.0 billion principal debt payment
upon maturity of our senior notes and higher share repurchases. See Note 10—Debt and Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity, to
our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to
various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-
term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the
return that these holdings provide.
Cash, cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance were $16.5
billion and our available-for-sale debt securities were $3.2 billion. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in
securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities
issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. $1.5 billion of the investments are classified as current
and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more
than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.
Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of
the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the
ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic
conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we
could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have
policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.
Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and
for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes,
with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. At September 30, 2021, we had no outstanding obligations under the
program. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data of this report.

Table of Contents
Credit facility. We have an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires on July 25,
2024. As of September 30, 2021, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to
insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases, we maintain a U.S.
litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be
payable. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters,
we do not rely on them for other operational needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and
Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data of this report.
Credit Ratings
Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment,
conditions in the electronic payments industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. Our credit ratings
are published by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the U.S. and have not changed from the prior-year
comparable period. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be
significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing
costs and access to capital markets.
Uses of Liquidity
Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial
daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or
payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two
business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2021, we were not
required to fund settlement-related working capital. At September 30, 2021, we held $9.1 billion of our total available liquidity to
fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity
available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. See Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings, other than
the U.S. covered litigation and VE territory covered litigation, which are covered by the U.S. and Europe retrospective
responsibility plans, could give rise to future liquidity needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data of this report.
Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2021, we repurchased 40 million shares of our class A common stock in the
open market for $8.7 billion. As of September 30, 2021, our January 2021 Program had remaining authorized funds of $4.8
billion. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data of this report.
Dividends. During fiscal 2021, we declared and paid $2.8 billion in dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.32 per share. On
October 22, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.375 per share of class A common stock
(determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an
as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $812 million in connection with this dividend on December 7, 2021. See
Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board
of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future
dividends.
Capital expenditures. During fiscal 2021, our capital expenditures decreased slightly. We expect to continue investing in
technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.
Senior notes. As of September 30, 2021, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our fixed-rate
senior notes of $21.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from September 2022 to August 2050. During fiscal 2021, we repaid
$3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of our senior notes. A principal payment of $1.0 billion is
43
Table of Contents
due on September 14, 2022 on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in December 2015, for which we have sufficient liquidity. In
August 2020, we issued a $500 million green bond as part of our commitment to sustainable living and a sustainable payments
ecosystem. In fiscal 2021, we allocated $165 million to eligible green projects. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Client incentives. As the future cash payments for these agreements, which range in terms from less than one to fifteen
years, are based on specific performance requirements, the timing of payments can vary. As of September 30, 2021, we had
$5.4 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these agreements. See Note 1—
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data of this report.
Uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2021, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.8 billion for which
we cannot determine the range and timing of the cash payments. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Pending acquisitions. On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink for €1.8 billion, inclusive
of cash and retention incentives. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and
approvals.
On July 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Currencycloud for a value of £700 million, inclusive of
cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that we
already own. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. See Note
2—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of
this report.
Other uses of cash. The following table represents material, expected or contractually committed future obligations as of
September 30, 2021. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations
and available credit facility.

Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries
recognized during fiscal 2018 in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Indemnifications
We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its
settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of
unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and
procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update
(“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in
the existing guidance and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021.
The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions
that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value
measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S.
GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another
reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an
amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are
evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. The
adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.
See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek
to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However,
actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported
financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
Revenue Recognition —Client Incentives
Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other
business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing
payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving
innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable
benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized
systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These estimates are regularly
reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments
to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.
Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card
issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information
accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients,
merchants and business partners.
Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client
incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased
payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed
estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and
estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2021, client incentives represented 26% of gross revenues.
45
Table of Contents
Legal and Regulatory Matters
Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our
complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss
and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which
we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is
reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on management’s understanding of the litigation profile, the
specifics of each case, our history with similar proceedings, advice of in-house and outside legal counsel to the extent
appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the
potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.
We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S.
retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered
litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered
litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective
responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the
covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission
proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal
Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in
the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could
have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters to
our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Income Taxes
Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions,
including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.
Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and
credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws. We also
inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities
for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the
relevant taxing authorities.
Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable,
actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If
one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have
recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash
flows.
ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial
market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate
risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the
functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the
functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward
contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency
denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely
eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.
46
Table of Contents
At September 30, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $2.7
billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2021 is fully consistent with
our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold.
However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. At September 30, 2021, the effect of a hypothetical 10%
weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of approximately $190
million on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The loss from this hypothetical weakening would be largely
offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments. See Note 1—
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of Visa
Europe is the Euro. Translation from the Euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates
in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period.
Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the
consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at
September 30, 2021 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.0 billion. See Note 1—Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data of this report.
We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate
setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement
activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction
with foreign exchange trading counterparties.
Interest Rate Risk
Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Investments in fixed-rate
instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise
in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds
are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income.
At September 30, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of our fixed-rate investment securities were $5.5 billion and $4.0 billion,
respectively, and the fair value of our adjustable-rate investment securities were $0.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. At
September 30, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in the fair
value of our investment securities of approximately $40 million. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate
changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until
maturity.
We have interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to
manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of
borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments
into U.S. dollar and Euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks
associated with market interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted
in an increase of approximately $40 million in annual interest expense. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Equity Investment Risk
As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $1.5 billion and $1.0
billion, respectively. These investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or
increase the carrying value of our holdings. A decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could
result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies. We regularly review our non-marketable
equity securities for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances
influencing the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.
47
Table of Contents
Pension Plan Risk
At September 30, 2021 and 2020, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $0.9 billion at each year end. A material adverse decline in the value of
pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the
pension plans, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. As of September 30, 2021, a hypothetical 10%
decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of
approximately $225 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $26 million in pension cost.
At September 30, 2021 and 2020, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.5 billion at each year end,
and projected benefit obligations were $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of
pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the
pension plans, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. As of September 30, 2021, a hypothetical 10%
decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of
approximately $166 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $16 million in pension cost.
We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of
our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2022, if any, which would be made in September 2022.

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visa Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively,
the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm—(Continued)
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Assessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement in the
Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)
As discussed in Notes 5 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various legal
proceedings including the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Individual Merchant Actions, and has recorded an
accrued litigation liability of $881 million as of September 30, 2021. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the
Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and amount of such loss, if
any. The outcome of legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company
or may not be known for prolonged periods of time.
We identified the assessment of the accrued liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement, also
known as the MDL – Individual Merchant Actions, as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves complex claims that
are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the accrued litigation liability
for the MDL – Individual Merchant Actions required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and
estimation associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. Changes to the outcome could have a
significant effect on the estimated amount of the liability.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s litigation accrual process for the MDL –
Individual Merchant Actions. We assessed the amounts accrued by reading letters received directly from the Company’s
external legal counsel and in-house legal counsel that discussed the Company’s legal matters, including the MDL – Individual
Merchant Actions. We considered relevant publicly available information, such as published news articles about the Company
and its legal matters, including the MDL – Individual Merchant Actions. We evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its
monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal
matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. To assess the estimated monetary exposure in the
Company’s analysis, we compared such amounts to the complete population of amounts attributable to opt-out merchants. We
also performed sensitivity analysis over the Company’s monetary exposure calculations.

entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material
to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
The Company’s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. All significant
operating decisions are based on analysis of Visa as a single global business. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable
segment, Payment Services.
Use of estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new
events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the
period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. As the effects of an
evolving coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues, much remains uncertain. There have been no comparable recent
events and as a result the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 and new variants continue to
impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as
appropriate.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash and
certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are
primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines
restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general
operating activities. See Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents.
Restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow. The Company maintains an escrow account from which monetary
liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe
Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters for a discussion of the U.S. covered litigation. The escrow
funds are held in money market investments, together with the interest earned, less applicable taxes payable, and classified as
restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest earned on escrow funds is included in non-operating
income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair value. The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain non-
financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are measured at cost and only
recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value
measurements are reported under a three-level valuation hierarchy. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments.
Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities, which are reported in investment securities on the
consolidated balance sheets, include mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation and benefit plans.
Trading activity in these investments is at the direction of the Company’s employees. These
60

investments are held in a trust and are not available for the Company’s operational or liquidity needs. Interest and dividend
income as well as gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from changes in fair value are recorded in non-operating income
(expense), and offset in personnel expense on the consolidated statements of operations.
Available-for-sale debt securities. The Company’s investment in debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale
and reported in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include U.S. government-sponsored debt securities
and U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are recorded at cost at the time of purchase and are carried at fair value. The
Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with
original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or
investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are
classified as non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
on the consolidated balance sheets. The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of
securities, which is recorded in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income
is recognized when earned and is included in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair
value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an impairment if: (1) it has the intent to sell
the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis;
or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company identifies that the decline in
fair value has resulted from credit losses, the credit loss component is recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet and in
non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The non-credit loss component remains in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized from a sale or subsequent impairment.
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities, which are reported in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values.
All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income
(expense).
The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between 20% and
50% ownership in the entity or when it exercises significant influence. Under the equity method, the Company’s share of each
entity’s profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity
method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when
the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of outstanding ownership interests, regardless of whether
the Company has significant influence over the investees.
The Company applies the fair value measurement alternative for investments in other entities when it holds less than
20% ownership in the entity and does not exercise significant influence, or for flow-through entities when the investment
ownership is less than 5% and the Company does not exercise significant influence. These investments consist of equity
holdings in non-public companies and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company adjusts
the carrying value of these equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same
issuer are observable.
The Company regularly reviews investments accounted for under the equity method and the fair value measurement
alternative for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing
the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.
Financial instruments. The Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash, cash equivalents,
restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, investment securities, settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable,
customer collateral, non-marketable equity investments and derivative instruments. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements
and Investments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2021
Settlement receivable and payable. The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment
transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company’s financial institution clients are settled within the same
day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance. Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain
outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as
settlement receivable and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets.
Customer collateral. The Company holds cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure
their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment services are processed in accordance with the
Company’s operating rules. The cash collateral assets are restricted and fully offset by corresponding liabilities and both
balances are presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under
the Company’s name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell
these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by
client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent
financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of
institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. See Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management.
Guarantees and indemnifications. The Company recognizes an obligation at inception for guarantees and
indemnifications that qualify for recognition, regardless of the probability of occurrence. The Company indemnifies its financial
institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in
accordance with the Visa operating rules. The Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for
those credit losses related to its settlement indemnification obligations. The estimated fair value of the liability for settlement
indemnification is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Property, equipment and technology, net. Property, equipment and technology are recorded at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life.
Depreciation and amortization of technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment are computed over estimated useful lives
ranging from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease
term. Building improvements are depreciated between 3 and 40 years, and buildings are depreciated over 40 years.
Improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life.
Land and construction-in-progress are not depreciated. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, equipment and
technology, net, until removed from service.
Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through
acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network.
Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred
during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended
use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology’s estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets
are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected
undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Note 7—Property,
Equipment and Technology, Net.
Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and
corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease
payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the
time of commencement. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its
incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of
lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any
lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain
that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases
with terms of 12 months or less.
62
Table of Contents
VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2021
Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include
payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any
of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s lease cost is included in general and administrative expense in
the consolidated statements of operations and consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements, adjusted for
impairment and sublease income.
Intangible assets, net. The Company records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and
evaluates the useful life of each asset.
Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 3
to 15 years. See Note 8—Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade name, customer relationships and reacquired rights. Intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is
necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each
category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash
flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived
intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment
assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques.
The Company performed its annual impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1, 2021, and
concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment of
the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of September 30, 2021.
Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a
business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.
The Company performed its annual impairment review of goodwill as of February 1, 2021, and concluded there was no
impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of
September 30, 2021.
Accrued litigation. The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to
which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory
proceedings, the merits of the Company’s defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual
outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company’s estimates. The Company
expenses legal costs as incurred in professional fees in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 20—Legal
Matters.
Revenue recognition. The Company’s net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service
revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by client incentives. As a
payments network service provider, the Company’s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access
to our payments network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of
transactions and payments volume on Visa’s products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes,
as the payments network services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive
in exchange for those services. Fixed fees for payments network services are generally recognized ratably over the related
service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations
related to payments network services and other performance obligations which are constrained by and dependent upon the
future performance of its clients, which are variable in nature. The Company also recognizes revenues, net of sales and other
similar
63

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2021
taxes, from other value added services, including issuer solutions, acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions and
advisory services, as these value added services are performed.
Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment
services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter’s pricing applied to the
prior quarter’s payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing
acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted.
Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value added services,
network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the
Company’s clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or
services are performed.
International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities.
Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer or financial institution originating the transaction is
different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border
transactions occur or services are performed.
Other revenues consist mainly of value added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for
account holder services, certification, licensing and card benefits, such as extended account holder protection and concierge
services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed.
Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic
partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments
volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa’s network and driving
innovation. Incentives are classified as reductions to revenues within client incentives, unless the incentive is a cash payment
made in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer, in which case the payment is classified as operating
expense. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the
amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on
performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future
performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on
changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new
contracts.
Marketing. The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is
expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits
from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the
related event occurs.
Income taxes. The Company’s income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income
tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect
the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation
allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income,
projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax
planning strategies.
Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax
uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in non-operating
income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such
election is beneficial to the Company. See Note 19—Income Taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2021
Pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of
return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the
projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected
rate of return on pension plan assets is primarily based on the targeted allocation, and evaluated for reasonableness by
considering such factors as: (i) actual return on plan assets; (ii) historical rates of return on various asset classes in the
portfolio; (iii) projections of returns on various asset classes; and (iv) current and prospective capital market conditions and
economic forecasts. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in
excess of a 10% corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period,
which ranges from approximately 7 to 9 years for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Other assumptions involve
demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company
evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate.
The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash
payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are
met. See Note 11—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.
Foreign currency remeasurement and translation. The Company’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of
its foreign operations except for Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”) whose functional currency is the Euro. Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the
exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency
using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical
exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are
recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal
2021, 2020 and 2019.
Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is
performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and for revenue and expense
accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.
Derivative financial instruments. The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure
to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. The terms of
these derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges are generally no more than 12 months. The Company uses
regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. The effectiveness tests are performed on
foreign exchange forward contracts based on changes in the spot rate of the derivative instrument compared to changes in the
spot rate of the forecasted hedged transaction.
Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the
consolidated balance sheets. When the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognized in earnings, the amount in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to that hedge is reclassified to the consolidated statements of
operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is recorded. Forward points are excluded from
effectiveness testing and measurement purposes and are reported in earnings. Cash flow hedges are subject to master netting
agreements, which provide the Company with a legal right to net settle multiple payable and receivable positions with the
same counterparty, in a single currency through a single payment. However, the Company presents fair values on a gross
basis on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company holds foreign exchange forward contracts which were designated as a net investment hedge against a
portion of the Company’s net investment in Visa Europe. The Company also holds interest rate and cross-currency swap
agreements on a portion of the outstanding senior notes that allows the Company to manage its interest rate exposure through
a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce the overall cost of borrowing. The Company designated the interest rate
swaps as a fair value hedge and the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Gains and losses related to changes in
fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the
change in fair value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains
and losses related to changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).
Amounts

excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense).
The Company utilizes foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
related to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Gains and losses resulting from changes in
the fair value of these derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative
expense for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity.
Cash flows associated with a cash flow hedge are classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statement of
cash flows. Cash flows associated with a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities
depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with a net investment hedge are classified
as an investing activity. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments.
Share-based compensation. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures,
using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service
conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost
for performance-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target
performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management’s best estimate throughout the performance period. See
Note 17—Share-based Compensation.
Earnings per share. The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights
of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is
reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Note 16—Earnings Per Share.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”)
2016-13, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets and certain other
instruments held at amortized cost, replacing the incurred loss model. Subsequently, the FASB also issued amendments to
this standard. The Company adopted the guidance effective October 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective transition
method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the previous applicable guidance. The adoption did not have
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating
Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by
comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, which is Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An
impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value,
not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted the standard effective
October 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements
by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2020. The
adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor
defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The Company
adopted this standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

Net revenues $ 24,105 $ 21,846 $ 22,977 
Remaining performance obligations are comprised of deferred revenues and unbilled contract revenues that will be
invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods primarily related to value added services. As of September 30, 2021,
the remaining performance obligations were $1.7 billion. The Company expects approximately half to be recognized as
revenue in the next two years and the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is affected
by several factors, including contract modifications and terminations, which could impact the estimate of amounts allocated to
remaining performance obligations and when such revenues could be recognized.

sharing agreement, a loss sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement, as amended.
U.S. covered litigation consists of a number of matters that have been settled or otherwise fully or substantially resolved,
as well as the following:
•the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation,
1:05-md-01720-JG-JO (E.D.N.Y.) or MDL 1720, including all cases currently included in MDL 1720, any other case
that includes claims for damages relating to the period prior to the Company’s IPO that has been or is transferred for
coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; 
•any claim that challenges the reorganization or the consummation thereof; provided that such claim is transferred for
coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings at any time to MDL 1720 by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation or otherwise included at any time in MDL 1720 by order of any court of competent jurisdiction; and
•any case brought after October 22, 2015 by a merchant that opted out of the Rule 23(b)(3) settlement class in MDL
1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not
transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. See Note 20—Legal Matters.
U.S. litigation escrow agreement. In accordance with the U.S. litigation escrow agreement, the Company maintains an
escrow account, from which settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are paid. The amount of the escrow is
determined by the board of directors and the Company’s litigation committee, all members of which are affiliated with, or act
for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the
U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 20—Legal Matters.

The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account by fiscal year:
2021 2020
 (in millions)
Balance at beginning of period $ 901 $ 1,205 
Return of takedown payment to the litigation escrow account — 467 
Payments to opt-out merchants and interest earned on escrow funds (7) (771)
Balance at end of period $ 894 $ 901 
These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 20—Legal Matters.
Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares
of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common
stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same economic effect on diluted class A common stock earnings per
share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and
consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity.
Indemnification obligations. To the extent that amounts available under the U.S. litigation escrow arrangement and other
agreements in the plan are insufficient to fully resolve the U.S. covered litigation, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of Visa U.S.A.’s members for such excess amounts, including but
not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa U.S.A.’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in
accordance with their membership agreements.
Interchange judgment sharing agreement. Visa U.S.A. and Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”)
have entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with certain Visa U.S.A. members that have been named as
defendants in the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is described in Note 20—Legal Matters. Under this judgment
sharing agreement, Visa U.S.A. members that are signatories will pay their membership proportion of the amount of a final
judgment not allocated to the conduct of Mastercard.
Loss sharing agreement. Visa has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa U.S.A., Visa International and certain
Visa U.S.A. members. The loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of Visa U.S.A., Visa International and, in
certain circumstances, Visa with respect to: (i) the amount of a final judgment paid by Visa U.S.A. or Visa International in the
U.S. covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement, plus any amounts reimbursable to
the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories; or (ii) the damages portion of a settlement of a U.S. covered litigation
that is approved as required under Visa U.S.A.’s certificate of incorporation by the vote of Visa U.S.A.’s specified voting
members. The several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final
judgment enforceable against Visa U.S.A., Visa International or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing
agreement, or the amount of any approved settlement of a U.S. covered litigation, multiplied by such bank’s then-current
membership proportion as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.’s certificate of incorporation.
On October 22, 2015, Visa entered into an amendment to the loss sharing agreement. The amendment includes within
the scope of U.S. covered litigation any action brought after the amendment by an opt-out from the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement
Class in MDL 1720 that arises out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in MDL 1720 and that is not
transferred to or otherwise included in MDL 1720. On the same date, Visa entered into amendments to the interchange
judgment sharing agreement and omnibus agreement that include any such action within the scope of those agreements as
well.
Omnibus agreement. Visa entered into an omnibus agreement with Mastercard and certain Visa U.S.A. members that
confirmed and memorialized the signatories’ intentions with respect to the loss sharing agreement, the interchange judgment
sharing agreement and other agreements relating to the interchange multidistrict litigation, see Note 20—Legal Matters. Under
the omnibus agreement, the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation covered by the
omnibus agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%. In addition, the
monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Visa-related claims in accordance with the omnibus agreement would be treated
as a Visa portion. Visa would have no liability for the monetary portion of any judgment assigned to Mastercard-related claims
in accordance with the(1)
(1)
69
Table of Contents
VISA INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2021
omnibus agreement, and if a judgment is not assigned to Visa-related claims or Mastercard-related claims in accordance with
the omnibus agreement, then any monetary liability would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion
at 66.6667%. The Visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in
accordance with specified provisions of the Company’s U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The litigation provision on the
consolidated statements of operations was not impacted by the execution of the omnibus agreement.
On August 26, 2014, Visa entered into an amendment to the omnibus agreement. The omnibus amendment makes
applicable to certain settlements in opt-out cases in the interchange multidistrict litigation the settlement-sharing provisions of
the omnibus agreement, pursuant to which the monetary portion of any settlement of the interchange multidistrict litigation
covered by the omnibus agreement would be divided into a Mastercard portion at 33.3333% and a Visa portion at 66.6667%.
The omnibus amendment also provides that in the event of termination of the class settlement agreement, Visa and
Mastercard would make mutually acceptable arrangements so that Visa shall have received two-thirds and Mastercard shall
have received one-third of the total of (i) the sums paid to defendants as a result of the termination of the settlement
agreement and (ii) the takedown payments previously made to defendants.
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
UK loss sharing agreement. The Company has entered into a loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of
Visa Europe’s member financial institutions located in the United Kingdom (the “UK LSA members”). Each of the UK LSA
members has agreed, on a several and not joint basis, to compensate the Company for certain losses which may be incurred
by the Company, Visa Europe or their affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and
implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom prior to the closing of the Visa Europe
acquisition (the “Closing”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and, with respect to each UK LSA member, up
to a maximum amount of the up-front cash consideration received by such UK LSA member. The UK LSA members’
obligations under the UK loss sharing agreement are conditional upon, among other things, either (a) losses valued in excess
of the sterling equivalent on June 21, 2016 of €1.0 billion having arisen in UK covered claims (and such losses having reduced
the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock accordingly), or (b) the conversion rate of the series B preferred stock
having been reduced to zero pursuant to losses arising in claims relating to multilateral interchange fee rate setting in the Visa
Europe territory.
Litigation management deed. The Company has entered into a litigation management deed with Visa Europe which sets
forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory covered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting
from this litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated
conversion or reduction in the conversion rate of the shares of series B and C preferred stock. The litigation management deed
applies only to VE territory covered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). The litigation management deed provides
that the Company will generally control the conduct of the VE territory covered litigation, subject to certain obligations to report
and consult with the litigation management committees for VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory litigation
management committees”). The VE territory litigation management committees, which are composed of representatives of
certain Visa Europe members, have also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the
VE territory covered litigation.
The Company obtained certain protections for VE territory covered losses through the series B and C preferred stock, the
UK loss sharing agreement, and the litigation management deed, referred to as the “Europe retrospective responsibility plan.”
The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which
generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa’s protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where
the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe
territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not protect the Company in Europe
against all types of litigation or remedies or fines imposed in competition law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange
litigation specifically covered by the plan’s terms.
Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow
account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through
a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The total
amount of protection available through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan is
equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a)
the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the
70

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
September 30, 2021
current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa’s class A common stock price. This amount
differs from the value of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets. The book value of the preferred stock reflects its historical value recorded at the Closing less VE territory covered
losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conversion rate. The book value does not reflect changes in the
underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.
Visa Inc. net income will not be impacted by VE territory covered losses as long as the as-converted value of the
preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be
probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney’s fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company will record a
reduction to stockholders’ equity, which represents the Company’s right to recover such losses through adjustments to the
conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders’ equity is recorded in a contra-equity account
referred to as “right to recover for covered losses.”
As required by the litigation management deed, at the fourth anniversary of the Visa Europe acquisition, Visa, in
consultation with the VE territories litigation management committee, carried out a release assessment of the extent to which,
if at all, it would be appropriate to effect a partial conversion of series B or C preferred stock into class A common stock or
series A preferred stock. After the completion of this assessment, in September 2020, the Company released $7.3 billion of the
as-converted value from its series B and C preferred stock and issued 374,819 shares of series A preferred stock (the “Fourth
anniversary release”). Each holder of a share of series B and C preferred stock received a number of series A preferred stock
equal to the applicable conversion adjustment divided by 100. The Company paid $5 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional
shares of series A preferred stock. The release resulted in a downward adjustment to the series B and C preferred stock
conversion rates. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity.
VE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is
effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss
greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the
conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity will then be
recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the year ended September 30, 2021,
the Company recovered $55 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock
conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock.
The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for
covered losses” within stockholders’ equity during the year ended September 30, 2021:

VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 20—Legal Matters.
Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign
exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment.(1)

Level 1 assets and liabilities. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are
classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable
equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.
Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party
pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued
using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, gross
unrealized gains and losses were not material. As of September 30, 2021, $4.0 billion of the Company’s debt securities are
due within one year and $1.7 billion is due between one to five years.
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held
companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of
quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and
require management’s judgment.

Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of
the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not
identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $21.0 billion and
$22.5 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $24.1 billion and
$26.6 billion, respectively.
Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value
on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2021, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement
receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2021
approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements,
these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Senior Notes
The Company’s outstanding senior notes, or collectively, the “Notes”, are senior unsecured obligations of the Company,
ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated
debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries.
As of September 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. Each series of Notes may be
redeemed as a whole or in part at the Company’s option at any time at specified redemption prices.
During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes.
In August 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of
$3.3 billion with maturities of 7, 10 and a half and 30 years. The August 2027 Notes, 2031 Notes and 2050 Notes, or
collectively, the “August 2020 Notes”, have interest rates of 0.75%, 1.10% and 2.00%, respectively. Interest on the August
2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021. The net
aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $3.2 billion. The net proceeds
from the offering of the August 2027 Notes will be used to(1)

corporate purposes.
In April 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of
$4.0 billion with maturities of 7, 10 and 20 years. The April 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2040 Notes, or collectively, the “April
2020 Notes”, have interest rates of 1.90%, 2.05% and 2.70%, respectively. Interest on the April 2020 Notes is payable semi-
annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The net aggregate proceeds, after
deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $4.0 billion. The net proceeds from the offering of the April
2020 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes.
Commercial Paper Program
Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate
purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to
397 days from the date of issuance. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no outstanding obligations under
the program.
Credit Facility
On July 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $5.0
billion revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), which will expire on July 25, 2024. The Credit Facility is not governed by
any financial covenants. This Credit Facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and
for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility will be charged at the London Interbank
Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit
rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will
fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facility.
At September 30, 2021, future principal payments on the Company’s outstanding debt were as follows:

Note 11—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for all eligible employees residing in the U.S. The Company also
sponsors other pension benefit plans that provide benefits for internationally-based employees at certain non-U.S. locations.
Disclosures presented below include the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. plans, comprising only the Visa Europe
plans. Disclosures relating to other U.S. postretirement benefit plans and other non-U.S. pension benefit plans are not included
as they are immaterial, individually and in aggregate. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension
and other postretirement benefit plans.
Defined benefit pension plans. The U.S. pension benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were earned based on a
cash balance formula. An employee’s cash balance account was credited with an amount equal to 6% of eligible
compensation plus interest based on 30-year Treasury securities. In October 2015, the Company’s board of directors
approved an amendment of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan such that the Company discontinued employer
provided credits after December 31, 2015. Plan participants continue to earn interest credits on existing balances at the time of
the freeze.
The funding policy for the U.S. pension benefits is to contribute annually no less than the minimum required contribution
under ERISA.
Under the Visa Europe plans, retirement benefits are provided based on the participants’ final pensionable pay and are
currently closed to new entrants. However, future benefits continue to accrue for active participants. The

pension plans. Additional funding amounts may be agreed to with the UK pension plan trustees.

This assumption is not applicable for the U.S. plans due to the amendment of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in October 2015, which
discontinued the employer provided credits effective after December 31, 2015.
The U.S. plans include a cash balance plan with promised interest crediting rates. Under the plan rules, for fiscal 2021,
2020 and 2019, the weighted average interest crediting rates for the benefit obligation were 1.98%,1.88%, 2.26%, respectively,
and the weighted average interest crediting rates for the benefit cost set at the beginning of the period were 1.88%, 2.26% and
3.23% for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Pension Plan Assets
Pension plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to
support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan. Pension plan assets are managed by external
investment managers. Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly
basis. An independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations.
Pension plan assets are broadly diversified to maintain a prudent level of risk and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit
payments. The Company generally evaluates and rebalances pension plan assets, as appropriate, to ensure that allocations
are consistent with its investment strategy and within target allocation ranges. For U.S. pension plan assets, the Company’s
investment strategy is to invest in the following: equity securities of 35% to 65%, fixed income securities of 43% to 53% and
other, primarily consisting of cash equivalents to meet near term expected benefit payments and expenses, of up to 4%. At
September 30, 2021, U.S. pension plan asset allocations for these categories were 50%, 48% and 2%, respectively, which
were within target allocation ranges.
For non-U.S. pension plan assets, the Company’s investment strategy is to invest in the following: equity funds of 12%,
interest and inflation hedging assets of 50% and other of 38%, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt and
asset-backed securities, multi-asset funds and property. At September 30, 2021, non-U.S. pension plan asset allocations for
these categories were 12%, 45% and 43%, respectively, which generally aligned with the target allocations.(1)

Multi-asset securities represent pension plan assets that are invested in funds comprised of broad ranges of assets.
Level 1 assets. Cash equivalents, which comprise of money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities
are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets.
Level 2 assets. Collective investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that generally commingle the assets of
multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefit plans, to invest in a portfolio of stocks, bonds or other
securities. Although the collective investment funds held by the plan are ultimately invested in publicly traded equity securities,
their own unit values are not directly observable, and therefore they are classified as Level 2. Equity funds are investments in
mutual funds that in-turn ultimately invest in equity securities of various jurisdictions. These are classified as level 2 as the
equity funds held by the plan are not actively traded but the fair value of underlying securities are generally, although not
always, determined with observable data and inputs. The fair values of corporate debt, multi-asset and U.S. government-
sponsored securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets.
Level 3 assets. Asset-backed securities are bonds that are backed by various types of assets and primarily consist of
mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring
fair value.(1)

Other Benefits
The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, or 401(k) plan, that covers substantially all of its employees residing
in the U.S. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, personnel costs included $141 million, $140 million, and $121 million, respectively,
of expenses attributable to the Company’s employees under the 401(k) plan. The Company’s contributions to this 401(k) plan
are funded on a current basis, and the related expenses are recognized in the period that the payroll expenses are incurred.
Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement
obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to
the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement.
Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the
Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon
future events.
The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time,
which vary significantly day to day. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company’s maximum daily settlement
exposure was $105.0 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $65.1 billion.
The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement
exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At September 30, 2021 and 2020,
the Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure:

For fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized pre-tax net gains (losses) in other comprehensive income
(loss) related to net investment hedges of $20 million, ($318) million and $234 million, respectively. For fiscal 2021, 2020 and
2019, the Company recognized an increase in earnings of $156 million, $150 million and $95 million, respectively, related to
excluded forward points and interest differentials from forward contracts and swap agreements.
Credit and market risks. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. The
Company monitors the credit-worthiness of the financial institutions that are counterparties to its derivative financial
instruments and does not consider the risks of counterparty nonperformance to be significant. The Company mitigates this risk
by entering into master netting agreements, and such agreements require each party to post collateral against its net liability
position with the respective counterparty. As of September 30, 2021, the Company has received collateral of $35 million from
counterparties, which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and posted collateral of $9 million,
which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Notwithstanding the
Company’s efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there can be no absolute assurance that its hedging activities will
adequately protect against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. As of September 30, 2021, credit and
market risks related to derivative instruments were not considered significant.

Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is
entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates
applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as
repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the series B and C preferred stock conversion rates
and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective
Responsibility Plans.

The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares.
Effective price per share for each adjustment made during the year is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s class A
common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company’s current certificates of designations for its series B and C preferred stock. Effective
price per share for each fiscal year is calculated using the weighted-average effective prices of the respective adjustments made during the year.
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company makes a deposit into the litigation
escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through a reduction to the conversion rate of the
shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective
Responsibility Plans.

Common stock repurchases. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market for the following fiscal
years:
For the Years Ended September 30,

(in millions, except per share data)
Shares repurchased in the open market 40 44 56 
Average repurchase price per share $ 219.03 $ 183.00 $ 154.01 
Total cost $ 8,676 $ 8,114 $ 8,607 
Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases that settled during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. All shares repurchased in the open market
have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares.
Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost are calculated based on unrounded
numbers.
In January 2020, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $9.5 billion share repurchase program and in January
2021, authorized an additional $8.0 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2021 Program”). These authorizations
have no expiration date. As of September 30, 2021, the Company’s January 2021 Program had remaining authorized funds of
$4.8 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2021 have been completed.
Dividends. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company declared and paid dividends of $2.8 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.3
billion, respectively, at a quarterly rate of $0.32, $0.30 and $0.25 per share, respectively. On October 22, 2021, the Company’s
board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of
class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on
December 7, 2021, to all holders of record of the Company’s common and preferred stock as of November 12, 2021.
Class B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S.
covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other
holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class
A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current certificate of incorporation) or
similar person or an affiliate of a Visa Member or similar person. Upon such transfer, each share of class B common stock will
automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at
the time of such transfer.
Adjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock
completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof)
resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conversion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. covered litigation and
the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding
increase in the conversion rate. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
Class C common stock. As of September 30, 2021, all of the shares of class C common stock have been released from
transfer restrictions. A total of 141 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale
into the public market.
Preferred stock. In connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three new series of preferred stock of the Company were
created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends
declared on the Company’s class A common stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and
has preference over any class of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Company’s
assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution.(1)

The series B and C preferred stock is convertible upon certain conditions into shares of class A common stock or series A
preferred stock. The shares of series B and C preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become
convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of series B and C preferred
stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition, subject only to a
holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the series B and C preferred stock (whether by such
12th anniversary, or thereafter with respect to claims pending on such anniversary), the conversion rate would be adjusted
downward and the holder would receive either class A common stock or series A preferred stock (for those who are not eligible
to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company’s charter). The conversion rates may also be reduced from time to
time to offset certain liabilities.
The series A preferred stock, generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company’s class A common stock,
is freely transferable and each share of series A preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common
stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 5—U.S. and
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
Voting rights. The holders of the series B and C preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain
defined matters, including, in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the
Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the
Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences, rights and privileges of
the applicable series of preferred stock or (ii) receive securities, cash or other property that is different from what the
Company’s class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of
preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power
of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the series B and C preferred
stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the
series A preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the series B
and C preferred stock.
Class A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote.
Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any
decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together with the
class A common stockholders in a single class, and (ii) in specified circumstances, any consolidation, merger, combination or
similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class.
In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of
class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the
Company’s common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely
to any series of preferred stock.

Note 16—Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Participating securities include
the Company’s series A, B and C preferred stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain non-forfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based
on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of
common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares
outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock
issuable upon the conversion of series A, B and C preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion
rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury
stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

Note 17—Share-based Compensation
2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan
The Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, authorizes the compensation committee of the
board of directors to grant non-qualified stock options (“options”), restricted stock awards, RSUs and performance-based
shares to its employees and non-employee directors. On January 26, 2021, the EIP was amended to extend the termination
date from January 31, 2022 to January 26, 2031 and reduce the number of shares of class A common stock authorized for
grant from 236 million to 198 million. Shares available for grant may be either authorized and unissued or previously issued
shares subsequently acquired by the Company. Under the amended EIP, shares withheld for taxes, or shares used to pay the
exercise or purchase price of an award, shall not again be available for future grant. The EIP will continue to be in effect until
all of the common stock available under the EIP is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed, unless the EIP is
terminated earlier by the Company’s board of directors.
For fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of
$518 million, $393 million and $388 million, respectively, in personnel expense on its consolidated statements of operations.
The related tax benefits for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $73 million, $63 million and $59 million, respectively.
Options
Options issued under the EIP expire 10 years from the date of grant and primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date
of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions.
During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
For the Years Ended September 30,

instruments.
Applied a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding at September 30, 2021 to estimate the options expected to vest in the future.
During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the total intrinsic value of options exercised was $124 million, $146 million and $107
million, respectively, and the tax benefit realized was $23 million, $31 million and $23 million, respectively. As of September 30,
2021, there was $23 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.42 years.
Restricted Stock Units
RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full
under certain conditions. Upon vesting, RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or in cash, or a
combination thereof, at the Company’s option. The Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the
vesting period, RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents, but do not participate in the voting rights
granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock.
The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures for RSUs is calculated using the closing price of
class A common stock on the date of grant. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average grant date fair value of
RSUs granted was $209.00, $183.61 and $137.38, respectively. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the total grant date fair
value of RSUs vested was $331 million, $284 million and $228 million, respectively.

Performance-based Shares
For the Company’s performance-based shares, in addition to service conditions, the ultimate number of shares to be
earned depends on the achievement of both performance and market conditions. The performance condition is based on the
Company’s earnings per share target. The market condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return ranked
against that of other companies that are included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. For fiscal 2021, the fair value of the
performance-based shares incorporating the market condition is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation
model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free rate of return of 0.2%, expected term of 2 years, expected
volatility of 27.2% and expected dividend yield of 0.6%. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average grant date fair
value of performance-based shares granted was $229.81, $211.08 and $153.42 per share, respectively. Performance-based
shares vest over three years and are subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and
2019, the total grant date fair value of performance-based shares vested and earned was $47 million, $65 million and
$41 million, respectively. Compensation cost for performance-based shares is initially estimated based on target performance.
It is recorded net of estimated forfeitures and adjusted as appropriate throughout the performance period.

On June 10, 2021, the UK enacted legislation that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. As a
result, the Company recorded a $1.0 billion non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of its UK
deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016. The increase
in deferred tax liabilities reflects the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities.
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARP Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 11, 2021. The ARP Act did not
have a material impact on the Company’s financial results.
At September 30, 2021 and 2020, net deferred tax assets of $80 million and $63 million, respectively, are reflected in
other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or
some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The
fiscal 2021 and 2020 valuation allowances relate primarily to foreign net operating losses from subsidiaries acquired in recent
years. 
As of September 30, 2021, the Company had $42 million federal, $15 million state and $390 million foreign net operating
loss carryforwards from acquired subsidiaries. Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in years prior to fiscal 2018
will expire in fiscal 2034 through 2037. State net operating loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal 2028 through 2035. Federal
net operating losses generated after fiscal 2017 and foreign net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely. The
Company expects to fully utilize the state net operating loss carryforwards in future years.

The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. federal
statutory rate to pretax income, as a result of the following:
 For the Years Ended September 30,

Income tax provision $ 3,752 23 %$ 2,924 21 %$ 2,804 19 %
In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, the effective income tax rate was 23% and 21%, respectively. The effective tax rate in fiscal
2021 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the following:
•during fiscal 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax
liabilities, as discussed above;
•during fiscal 2021, $255 million of tax benefits recognized as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities;
and
•during fiscal 2020, a $329 million non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred
tax liabilities, as discussed below.
In fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, the effective income tax rate was 21% and 19%, respectively. The effective tax rate in fiscal
2020 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 mainly due to a $329 million non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related
to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities, as a result of the enactment of UK legislation on July 22, 2020 that
repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective April 1, 2020.
Current income taxes receivable at September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $83 million and $93 million, respectively, were
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Non-current income taxes receivable at September 30, 2021 and 2020
of $974 million and $988 million, respectively, were included in other assets. Income taxes payable at September 30, 2021 and
2020 of $325 million and $134 million, respectively, were included in accrued liabilities. Accrued income taxes at
September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, were included in other liabilities.
The Company’s operating hub in the Asia Pacific region is located in Singapore. Effective October 1, 2008 through
September 30, 2023, it is subject to a tax incentive which is conditional upon meeting certain business operations and
employment thresholds in Singapore. The tax incentive decreased Singapore tax by $273 million, $280 million and $324
million, and the gross benefit of the tax incentive on diluted earnings per share was $0.12, $0.13 and $0.14 in fiscal 2021, 2020
and 2019, respectively.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740—Income Taxes, the Company is required to inventory,
evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of
such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing
authorities.
At September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $2.5 billion, $2.6
billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion
and $2.2 billion are $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, that if recognized, would
reduce the effective tax rate in a future period.

In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $1 million, $68 million and $66 million of net interest expense,
respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company accrued penalties related to
uncertain tax positions of $3 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company
had accrued interest of $233 million, and accrued penalties of $34 million and $31 million, respectively, related to uncertain tax
positions included in other long-term liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal 2013 through 2018 and refund claims filed for fiscal 2008
through 2012 are currently under examination. The Company’s California income tax returns for fiscal 2012 through 2015 and
refund claims filed for fiscal 2006 through 2011 are currently under examination. Except for the refund claims, the federal and
California statutes of limitations have expired for fiscal years prior to 2012.
In September 2020, the Company accepted a settlement offer related to the examination of Canadian tax returns dating
back to fiscal 2003, which was subject to approval by the Tax Court of Canada. On January 21, 2021, the Tax Court of Canada
approved the settlement agreement related to the examination. The Company’s income tax provision was adjusted to reflect
the estimated impact of the settlement in fiscal 2020.
The India tax authorities completed the assessment of the Company’s income tax returns for the taxable years falling
within the period from fiscal 2010 to 2018, and made certain adjustments. The Company objected to these adjustments and
filed appeals to the appellate authorities. While the timing and outcome of the final resolution of these appeals are uncertain,
the Company believes that its income tax provision adequately reflects its income tax obligations in India.
The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign
tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2007. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal,
state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the
impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.
Note 20—Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims
that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has
not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the
matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the
Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the
future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions
or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other
parties.
The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of
each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance
sheet date.

U.S. Covered Litigation
Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Putative Class Actions
Beginning in May 2005, a series of complaints (the majority of which were styled as class actions) were filed in U.S.
federal district courts by merchants against Visa U.S.A., Visa International and/or Mastercard, and in some cases, certain U.S.
financial institutions. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordination of pre-trial proceedings in MDL 1720. A group of purported class
plaintiffs subsequently filed amended and supplemental class complaints. The individual and class complaints generally
challenged, among other things, Visa’s and Mastercard’s purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees, their “no
surcharge” and honor-all-cards rules, alleged tying and bundling of transaction fees, and Visa’s reorganization and IPO, under
the federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, certain state unfair competition laws. The complaints sought money damages,
declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and, in one instance, an order that the IPO be unwound.
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated, Mastercard International Incorporated, various U.S.
financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the “2012 Settlement Agreement”) to
resolve the class plaintiffs’ claims. Pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement, the Company deposited approximately $4.0
billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account and approximately $500 million attributable to interchange reductions for an
eight-month period into court-authorized settlement accounts. Visa subsequently received from the Court and deposited into
the Company’s U.S. litigation escrow account “takedown payments” of approximately $1.1 billion. On June 30, 2016, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower court’s certification of the merchant class, reversed the approval of
the settlement, and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings.
On remand, the district court entered an order appointing interim counsel for two putative classes of plaintiffs, a
“Damages Class” and an “Injunctive Relief Class.” The plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class
subsequently filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, seeking money damages and attorneys’ fees,
among other relief. A new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class, filed a
class action complaint against Visa, Mastercard, and certain bank defendants seeking, among other things, an injunction
against the setting of default interchange rates; against certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-
all-cards rule; and against various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee, as well as attorneys’ fees.
On September 17, 2018, Visa, Mastercard, and certain U.S. financial institutions reached an agreement with plaintiffs
purporting to act on behalf of the putative Damages Class to resolve all Damages Class claims (the “Amended Settlement
Agreement”), subject to court approval. The Amended Settlement Agreement supersedes the 2012 Settlement Agreement and
includes, among other terms, a release from participating class members for liability arising out of conduct alleged by the
Damages Class in the litigation, including claims that accrue no later than five years after the Amended Settlement Agreement
becomes final. Participating class members will not release injunctive relief claims as a named representative or non-
representative class member in the putative Injunctive Relief Class. The Amended Settlement Agreement also required an
additional settlement payment from all defendants totaling $900 million, with the Company’s share of $600 million paid from
the Company’s litigation escrow account established pursuant to the Company’s retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 5
—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The additional settlement payment was added to the approximately
$5.3 billion previously deposited into settlement accounts by the defendants pursuant to the 2012 Settlement Agreement.
Following a motion by the Damages Class plaintiffs for final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement, certain
merchants in the proposed settlement class objected to the settlement and/or submitted requests to opt out of the settlement
class. On December 13, 2019, the district court granted final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement relating to
claims by the Damages Class, which was subsequently appealed. Based on the percentage of class members (by payment
volume) that opted out of the class, $700 million was returned to defendants. Visa’s portion of the takedown payment was
calculated to be approximately $467 million, and upon receipt, was deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account with a
corresponding increase in accrued litigation to address opt-out claims.

On May 29, 2020, a complaint was filed by Old Jericho Enterprise, Inc. against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a
purported class of gasoline retailers operating in 24 states and the District of Columbia. On April 28, 2021, a complaint was
filed by Hayley Lanning and others, and on June 16, 2021, a complaint was filed by Camp Grounds Coffee and others, each
against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of merchants located in 25 states and the District of Columbia who
have taken payment using the Square card acceptance service. Each of these complaints alleges violations of the antitrust
laws of those jurisdictions and seeks recovery for plaintiffs as indirect purchasers. To the extent that these plaintiffs’ claims are
not released by the Amended Settlement Agreement, Visa believes they are covered by the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility
Plan.
On June 1, 2020, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served a motion for summary judgment regarding the claims in the
Injunctive Relief Class complaint. The putative Injunctive Relief Class plaintiffs served a motion for partial summary judgment.
On September 27, 2021, the district court certified without opt out rights an Injunctive Relief Class consisting of all merchants
that accept Visa or Mastercard credit or debit cards in the United States at any time between December 18, 2020 and entry of
final judgment.
Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Individual Merchant Actions
Since May 2013, more than 50 cases have been filed in or removed to various federal district courts by hundreds of
merchants generally pursuing damages claims on allegations similar to those raised in MDL 1720. The cases name as
defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated and Mastercard International Incorporated,
although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. A number of the cases include allegations that
Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments. Some
of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to
merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. In
addition, some cases assert that Visa, Mastercard and/or their member banks conspired to prevent the adoption of chip-and-
PIN authentication in the U.S. or otherwise circumvent competition in the debit market. Certain individual merchants have filed
amended complaints to, among other things, add claims for injunctive relief and update claims for damages.
In addition to the cases filed by individual merchants, Visa, Mastercard, and/or certain U.S. financial institution defendants
in MDL 1720 filed complaints against certain merchants in the Eastern District of New York seeking, in part, a declaration that
Visa’s conduct did not violate federal or state antitrust laws.
The individual merchant actions described in this section have been either assigned to the judge presiding over MDL
1720, or have been transferred or are being considered for transfer by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for inclusion
in MDL 1720. These individual merchant actions are U.S. covered litigation for purposes of the U.S. retrospective responsibility
plan. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40% of the Visa-branded payment
card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs.
On June 1, 2020, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served motions for summary judgment regarding the claims in
certain of the individual merchant actions, as well as certain declaratory judgment claims brought by Visa, Mastercard, and
some U.S. financial institutions. Plaintiffs in certain of the individual merchant actions served motions for partial summary
judgment.
The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims asserted in the putative class actions and individual
merchant actions, but the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur
judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of merchants’ claims, and such
developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results in the period in which the effect
becomes probable and reasonably estimable. While the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address monetary
liability in these matters, see Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans, judgments or settlements that
require the Company to change its business practices, rules, or contractual commitments could adversely affect the
Company’s financial results.

VE Territory Covered Litigation
Europe Merchant Litigation
Since July 2013, in excess of 750 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a
merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against
Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in
Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. They seek damages for alleged anti-
competitive conduct in relation to one or more of the following types of interchange fees for credit and debit card transactions:
UK domestic, Irish domestic, other European domestic, intra-European Economic Area and/or other inter-regional. As of the
filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 150 Merchants, leaving
more than 550 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence
similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims,
several of which have been settled. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have
not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. The Company has learned that several additional European entities
have indicated that they may also bring similar claims and the Company anticipates additional claims in the future.
A trial took place from November 2016 to March 2017, relating to claims asserted by only one Merchant. In judgments
published in November 2017 and February 2018, the court found as to that Merchant that Visa’s UK domestic interchange did
not restrict competition, but that if it had been found to be restrictive it would not be exemptible under applicable law. On July 4,
2018, the Court of Appeal overturned the lower court’s rulings, finding that Visa’s UK domestic interchange restricted
competition and the question of whether Visa’s UK domestic interchange was exempt from the finding of restriction under
applicable law had been incorrectly decided. Following an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, on June 17,
2020, the Supreme Court found that Visa’s UK domestic interchange restricted competition under applicable competition law.
On September 30, 2021, Visa reached a confidential settlement agreement resolving the plaintiff’s claims. Certain other
plaintiffs, whose claims were effectively stayed pending the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's judgment, are moving
their claims forward, mostly before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal.
The full scope of potential damages is not yet known because not all Merchant claims have been served and Visa has
substantial defenses. However, the claims that have been issued, served and/or preserved seek several billion dollars in
damages.
Other Litigation
On November 14, 2021, a motion to certify a class action was filed against Visa and Mastercard in the Israel Central
District Court. The motion asserts that interchange fees on cross-border transactions in Israel and the Honor All Cards rule are
anti-competitive and seeks damages and injunctive relief.
Other Litigation
Canadian Merchant Litigation
Beginning in December 2010, a number of class action lawsuits were filed in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario,
Saskatchewan and Alberta against Visa Canada, Mastercard and ten financial institutions on behalf of merchants that accept
payment by Visa and/or Mastercard credit cards. The actions alleged a violation of Canada’s price-fixing law and various
common law claims based on separate Visa and Mastercard conspiracies in respect of default interchange and certain of the
networks’ rules. In June 2017, Visa and Mastercard reached settlements with the plaintiffs. Courts in each of the five provinces
approved the settlements and appeals of the decisions approving the settlements were rejected.

U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation
National ATM Council Class Action. In October 2011, the National ATM Council and thirteen non-bank ATM operators
filed a purported class action lawsuit against Visa (Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and Plus System, Inc.) and
Mastercard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint challenges Visa’s rule (and a similar
Mastercard rule) that if an ATM operator chooses to charge consumers an access fee for a Visa or Plus transaction, that fee
cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions on other networks. Plaintiffs claim that the rule violates Section
1 of the Sherman Act, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. On August 4, 2021, the district court
granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and on October 1, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit granted defendants’ motion for leave to appeal the district court’s decision.
Consumer Class Actions. In October 2011, a purported consumer class action was filed against Visa and Mastercard in
the same federal court challenging the same ATM access fee rules. Two other purported consumer class actions challenging
the rules, later combined, were also filed in October 2011 in the same federal court naming Visa, Mastercard and three
financial institutions as defendants. Plaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees where
available under federal and state law, including under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and consumer protection statutes. On
September 20, 2019, plaintiffs in both cases filed motions for class certification. On August 4, 2021, the district court granted
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in each case, and on October 1, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit granted defendants’ motion for leave to appeal the district court’s decision. On November 12, 2021, in the
case in which the three financial institutions were named, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of
a class action settlement with those institutions.
U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand
On March 13, 2012, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the “Division”) issued a Civil
Investigative Demand, or “CID,” to Visa Inc. seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or
2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2. The CID focuses on PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa’s competitive responses
to the Dodd-Frank Act, including Visa’s fixed acquirer network fee. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the
CID.
Pulse Network
On November 25, 2014, Pulse Network LLC filed suit against Visa Inc. in federal district court in Texas. Pulse alleges that
Visa has, among other things, monopolized and attempted to monopolize debit card network services markets. Pulse seeks
unspecified treble damages, attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief, including to enjoin the fixed acquirer network fee structure,
Visa’s conduct regarding PIN-Authenticated Visa Debit and Visa agreements with merchants and acquirers relating to debit
acceptance. On August 31, 2018, the court granted Visa’s motion for summary judgment, finding that Pulse did not have
standing to pursue its claims. Pulse appealed the district court’s summary judgment decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit.
EMV Chip Liability Shift
Following their initial complaint filed on March 8, 2016, B&R Supermarket, Inc., d/b/a Milam’s Market, and Grove Liquors
LLC filed an amended class action complaint on July 15, 2016, against Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Mastercard, Discover, American
Express, EMVCo and certain financial institutions in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The amended
complaint asserts that defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty or otherwise rejected
payment card transactions from defendants to the purported class of merchants, defined as those merchants throughout the
U.S. who have been subjected to the “Liability Shift” since October 2015. Plaintiffs claim that the so-called “Liability Shift”
violates Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act and certain state laws, and seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’
fees.
EMVCo and the financial institution defendants were dismissed, and the matter was subsequently transferred to the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which has clarified that this case is not part of MDL 1720.
On August 28, 2020, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.

In December 2020 and January 2021, six savings banks and cooperative banks filed claims in Germany against Visa
Europe challenging Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of access fees on domestic cash withdrawals with a credit card
as anti-competitive. No damages were sought. The claims were withdrawn in August 2021.
U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand (2021)
On March 26, 2021, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Division”) issued a Civil Investigative
Demand (“CID”) to Visa seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2. The CID focuses on U.S. debit and competition with other payment methods and networks. Visa is
cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. On June 11, 2021, the Division issued a further CID seeking
additional documents and information on the same subjects.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation
On July 9, 2021, a class action complaint was filed against Visa in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California by several individuals on behalf of a nationwide class, and/or California, Washington, or Illinois subclasses, of
cardholders who made a transaction in a foreign currency. The complaint alleges that Visa sets foreign exchange rates in
violation of Visa’s rules and bank cardholder agreements, and asserts claims for unjust enrichment and restitution as well as
violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud
Act. Plaintiffs seek an injunction, damages, disgorgement, and attorneys’ fees among other relief. On October 18, 2021, Visa
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

ITEM 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures
Not applicable.
ITEM 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that is designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2021, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations
include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource
constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe
are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all
possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not
absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2021. Based on management’s assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and
reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks
discussed in Item 1A—Risk Factors of this report.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, has been audited by KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm and is included in Item 8 of this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In preparation for management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design
and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. There have been no significant changes in our
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
