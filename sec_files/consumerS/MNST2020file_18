ITEM 1.           BUSINESS
When this report uses the words “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”, these words refer to
Monster Beverage Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Based in
Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating
business, except through its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company’s subsidiaries primarily develop and
market energy drinks.

We develop, market, sell and distribute energy drink beverages and concentrates for energy drink
beverages, primarily under the following brand names:
●     Monster Energy®
●     Monster Energy Ultra®
●     Monster Rehab®
●     Monster MAXX®
●     Java Monster®
●     Muscle Monster®

Industry Overview
The “alternative” beverage category combines non-carbonated, ready-to-drink iced teas,
lemonades, juice cocktails, single-serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks,
energy drinks, sports drinks and single-serve still waters (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new
age” beverages, including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling
beverages. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2019 for the
“alternative” beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $58.6 billion, representing
an increase of approximately 5.7% over estimated domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2018 of
approximately $55.5 billion.
Reportable Segments
We have three operating and reportable segments; (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment
(“Monster Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks and Reign
Total Body FuelTM high performance energy drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic Brands”),
which is comprised primarily of the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company
(“TCCC”) in 2015, as well as our affordable energy brands, and (iii) Other segment (“Other”), which is
comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors, LLC (“AFF”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary, to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”). Corporate and
unallocated amounts that do not specifically relate to a reportable segment have been allocated to
“Corporate and unallocated.”
Table of Contents
4Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In
some cases, we sell directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass
merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce
retailers and the military.
Our Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
to other bottlers, full service distributors or retailers, including, retail grocery and specialty chains,
wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores,
value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment
generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and
full service beverage distributors.
Generally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating
revenues, but lower per case gross profit margin percentages than the Strategic Brands segment.
For certain risks with respect to our energy drinks see “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” below.
Corporate History
In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices
in Los Angeles, California. In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a
demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc.
(“HFI”). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural Soda® brand sodas. In
1990, California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain
assets of HFI, including the right to market the Hansen’s® brand name. In 1992, Hansen Natural
Corporation acquired the Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our
ownership, the Hansen’s® beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages
within the growing “alternative” beverage category including, in particular, energy drinks. In 2012, we
changed our name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015, we
acquired various energy brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business. In 2016, we
completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner AFF.

limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable

Table of Contents
8Manufacture and Distribution
We do not directly manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource the manufacturing process
to third-party bottlers and contract packers.
AFF develops and manufactures the primary flavors for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment.
We also purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, supplement ingredients, cans, bottles, caps,
labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our beverage products from ingredient suppliers, which are
delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may
be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-
party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including supplement ingredients)
for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance
with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/packer may also add carbonation
to the products as part of the production process.
For our Strategic Brands segment, we primarily purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases
from ingredient suppliers, which are then sold to certain of our various third-party bottlers/distributors.
The third-party bottlers/distributors are responsible for the manufacture and packaging of the finished
products, including the procurement of all other required ingredients and packaging materials. For certain
limited products in the Strategic Brands segment, we may purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners,
juices, supplement ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our
Strategic Brand products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and
co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers
and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or
other ingredients (including supplement ingredients), for the manufacture and packaging of the finished
products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the
beverage, the bottler/co-packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production
process.
Co-Packing Arrangements
All of our finished goods are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers
situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. The
majority of our co-packaging arrangements are generally on a month-to-month basis or are terminable
upon request and do not generally obligate us to produce any minimum quantities of products within
specified periods.
In some instances, subject to agreement, certain equipment may be purchased exclusively by us
and/or jointly with our co-packers, and installed at their facilities to enable them to produce certain of our
products. In certain cases, such equipment remains our property and is required to be returned to us upon
termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers, unless we are reimbursed by the co-
packer at the then book value or via a per-case credit over a pre-determined number of cases that are
produced at the facilities concerned.
For our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, we are generally responsible for arranging for the
purchase and delivery to our third-party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage
products are packaged.
Our products are packaged in a number of locations, both domestically and internationally, which
enables us to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold, with the objective of reducing
freight costs as well as transportation-related product damages. As distribution volumes increase in both
our domestic and international markets, we will continue to source additional packing arrangements
closer to such markets to further reduce freight costs.
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and
may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially
underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials
including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap
Table of Contents
9cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, caps, labels,
flavors, juice concentrates, coffee, tea, supplement ingredients, other ingredients and certain sweeteners,
and/or procure adequate packing arrangements and/or obtain adequate or timely shipment of our
products, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk
Factors”).
Our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request. For
many of our products, including certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, our Java
Monster® product line, our Espresso Monster® product line, our Caffé Monster®  product line, our
Monster Hydro® product line, our Monster HydroSport Super Fuel® product line, our Muscle Monster®
product line, our Monster MAXX® product line, our Juice Monster® product line, our Reign Total Body
FuelTM product line, our Reign InfernoTM Thermogenic Fuel product line and certain of our other
products, there are limited co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate
capacity and/or suitable equipment to package our products. We believe a short disruption or delay in
production would not significantly affect our revenues; however, as alternative co-packing facilities in
our domestic and international markets with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such
products, either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all, a
lengthy disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues.
We continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities around the world
(including in Africa, Asia, Australia, Central and South America, China, Europe, India, Mexico, the
Middle East and the United States) with adequate capacity and capability for the production of our
various products to minimize transportation costs and transportation-related damages as well as to
mitigate the risk of a disruption in production and/or importation.
Distribution Agreements
During 2019, we continued to expand distribution of our products in both our domestic and
international markets.
Distribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Net sales outside the United States
were $1.33 billion, $1.09 billion and $909.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017, respectively.
Monster Energy® Distribution Agreements
We have entered into agreements with various bottlers/distributors providing for the distribution
of our products during initial terms of up to twenty years, which may be renewed thereafter for additional
terms ranging from one to five years, subject to certain terms and conditions which may vary depending
on the form of the agreement. Such agreements remain in effect for their then-current term as long as our
products are being distributed, but are subject to specified termination rights held by each party, which
may include by way of example, and depending on the form of agreement, termination upon: mutual
agreement; material breach of the agreement by, or an insolvency of, either party; deadlock; change of
control; changes in legal or regulatory conditions and termination of certain related agreements.
Additionally, we are entitled to terminate certain distribution agreements at any time without cause upon
payment of a termination fee, including a limited number of distribution agreements with TCCC network
bottlers that were entered into prior to 2015.
Certain of our material distribution arrangements for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks,
as amended from time to time, are described below:
(a)Amended and Restated Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we
have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in
Canada and the United States in which bottlers from TCCC’s network of wholly or partially-
owned and independent bottlers (the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and sell,
or continue to distribute and sell, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.
Table of Contents
10(b)Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with Coca-Cola Refreshments (“CCR”),
pursuant to which CCR distributes, directly and through certain sub-distributors, our Monster
Energy® brand energy drinks in a large portion of the United States. As of March 1, 2018, all of
the territory previously falling under the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with
CCR has been assigned by CCR to various TCCC network bottlers in the United States,
including Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. and Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC.
(c)Amended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant
to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries, or territories within
countries, in which we wish to appoint TCCC network bottlers to distribute and sell our Monster
Energy® brand energy drinks, subject to TCCC’s approval. In February 2020, the Amended and
Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC was renewed for an
additional five year term.
(d)Additionally, we have entered into distribution agreements for certain of our Monster Energy®
products with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally.
As of December 31, 2019, all distribution territories in the U.S. have been transitioned to TCCC
network bottlers.
Strategic Brands Distribution Agreements
We have entered into distribution coordination agreements with TCCC pursuant to which we
have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in which TCCC
network bottlers will distribute our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
We have entered into agreements with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States
and internationally, providing for the distribution and sale of our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum cans,
aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles,
caps, as well as flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, coffee, tea,
supplement ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations.
AFF is the primary flavor supplier for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. We also
purchase flavors from other suppliers as well as juices, supplement ingredients, glucose, sugar, sucralose,
other sweeteners and other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and
abroad.
For our Strategic Brands energy drinks, we purchase flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases
from flavor suppliers including TCCC in the United States and abroad, and may purchase certain other
ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.
With regard to our Java Monster®, Espresso Monster®, Caffé Monster® and Muscle Monster®
product lines, the dairy, protein and retort co-packing industries are subject to shortages and increased
demand from time to time, which may result in production disruption and/or higher prices.
For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our
Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor
suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the
list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of
our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable
Table of Contents
11flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers
generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers.
We have identified alternative suppliers for many of the ingredients contained in many of our
beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, dairy-
based products, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the
future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products.
We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavors and
concentrates purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as to negotiate arrangements with our existing
suppliers, which would enable us to obtain access to certain of such concentrates or flavor formulas under
certain circumstances. We have been partially successful in these endeavors. Additionally, in a limited
number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses
may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers, manufacturers and/or
distributors.
Competition
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing,
packaging, development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies.
Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies,
many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include brand and product image,
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and
unique cutting edge products, ingredients, attractive and different packaging, brand exposure and
marketing as well as pricing. We also rely on our bottlers and full service beverage distributors to allocate
more attention to our products than those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and
secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the “alternative”, energy, coffee and
“functional” beverage categories could cause our products to maintain or to lose market share or we
could experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.
We have experienced and continue to experience competition from new entrants in the energy
drink and energy shot categories. A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, coffees,
juice cocktails, enhanced waters and sports drinks in various larger volume packages in glass and plastic
bottles (including Bai, Sobe Life Water, BODYARMOR, Vitamin Water, CORE, Snapple, Arizona, Fuse,
Ocean Spray, Honest Tea, Gold Peak Tea, Powerade, Gatorade Bolt 24 and Starbucks) and 12- and 16-
ounce cans (such as Mountain Dew Kickstart and Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel), have added
supplement ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as “functional” or
energy beverages or as having “functional” benefits. We believe that many of those products contain
lower levels of supplement ingredients, principally deliver refreshment and are positioned differently
from our energy or “functional” drinks.
We are also subject to increasing levels of regulatory issues including in relation to the
registration and/or taxation of our products in certain new international markets, which may put us at a
competitive disadvantage. (See “Government Regulation” below for additional information).
We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum marketing and sales efforts
by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors, many of which have a principal affiliation with
competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases
with products of much larger and in some cases better financed competitors, including the products of
numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”),
Keurig Dr. Pepper, Inc. (“KDP”) and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete with companies that
Table of Contents
are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private-label brands such as
those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.
Domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Amp, Venom, VPX
Redline, Rip It, Xenergy, 5-Hour Energy Shots, MiO Energy, Stacker 2, VPX Bang, V8 + Energy,
Uptime, hi*ball, CELSIUS, C4, Coca-Cola Energy and many other brands. PepsiCo also markets and/or
distributes additional products in that market segment such as Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew
Kickstart and Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel. Internationally, our energy drinks compete with Red Bull
(including non-carbonated Red Bull in China and Asia), Rockstar, V-Energy, Lucozade, Coca-Cola
Energy and numerous local and private-label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as
HELL, Amper, Shock, Tiger, Boost, TNT, Shark, Dragon, Score, Sting, Hot 6, Battery, Bullit, Flash Up,
Black, Non-Stop, Bomba, Semtex, Vive 100, Dark Dog, Speed, Guarana, M-150, Lipovitan, Bacchus,
Volt, Bolt, Mr. Big, Boom, Raptor, Amp, Fusion, Hi-Tiger, Eastroc Super Drink, Carabao, Power Horse,
XL, Crazy Tiger, Effect, Missile, Nocco, Adrenaline Rush, Real Gold, War Horse, BLU, and a host of
other international brands.
Our Reign Total Body FuelTM and Reign InfernoTM Thermogenic Fuel high performance energy
drinks compete with VPX Bang, Adrenaline Shoc, C4, CELSIUS, Rockstar XDURANCE and Quake in
the performance energy category.
Our Java Monster®, Espresso Monster® and Caffé Monster® product lines compete directly
with Starbucks Frappuccino, Starbucks Doubleshot, Starbucks Doubleshot Energy Plus Coffee, Starbucks
Tripleshot and other Starbucks coffee drinks, Costa Coffee, Rockstar Roasted, Dunkin Donuts, Gold
Peak, Stok, High Brew, McCafé, hi*ball, Douwe Egberts Coffee, Emmi CAFFÈ, Bang Keto Coffee,
Nescafe and International Delight.
Our Muscle Monster® product line competes directly with Muscle Milk, Core Power, Premier
Protein, Kellogg’s Special K Protein, Bolthouse Farms Protein, EAS AdvantEDGE, EAS Myoplex and
Gatorade G Series 03 Recover.
Our Monster Hydro® and Monster HydroSport Super Fuel® product lines compete directly with
Vitamin Water, Sparkling Ice, Bai, Propel, Vita Coco, Lucozade, Powerade, Gatorade Bolt 24 and
BODYARMOR.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand
awareness through image-enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and
other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize
“push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks,
coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale
materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize
promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, sports
personality endorsements, sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes, teams, series, bands, esports,
causes and events. In-store posters, outdoor posters, social media, concerts, print, radio and television
advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to
promote our brands.
We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our
brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers.
We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them
different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned and refreshed from
time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which
we continue to reevaluate from time to time.
Where appropriate, we partner with our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers to assist our
marketing efforts.
We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 10.9% in
2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased expenditures for social media,
12sponsorships and endorsements as well
Table of Contents
13as advertising. As of December 31, 2019, we employed 2,422 employees in sales and marketing
activities, of which 1,273 were employed on a full-time basis.
Customers
Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery, drug and
specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice
customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. Percentages of our gross sales to our
various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are reflected below. Such
information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full
service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors
in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our
description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without
reference to such bottlers/distributors’ sales to their own customers.

Inc. (until April 5, 2019), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club) and Costco Wholesale Corporation.  A
decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products
could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
TCCC, through certain consolidated subsidiaries (the “TCCC Subsidiaries”), accounted for
approximately 2%, 3% and 18% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. As part of TCCC’s North America Refranchising initiative (the “North America
Refranchising”), the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain
independent TCCC bottlers/distributors and bottlers/distributors which TCCC accounts for under the
equity method (the “TCCC Related Parties”). Accordingly, our percentage of net sales to the TCCC
Subsidiaries significantly decreased for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales for the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 6% of the
Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Coca-Cola European Partners accounted for approximately 10%, 10% and 9% of the Company’s
net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

14Seasonality
Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar
quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. We believe that the volume of sales in the beverage
industry is affected by weather conditions. However, the energy drink category appears to be less
seasonal than traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including
the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets, particularly internationally, where
temperature fluctuations may be more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes
in the mix of the sales of our finished products and increased or decreased advertising and promotional
expenses.
Intellectual Property
We presently have more than 12,900 registered trademarks and pending applications in various
countries worldwide, and we apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis. We regard our trademarks,
service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and other intellectual property as very important to
our business. We consider Monster®, Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Dragon
Tea®, Unleash the Beast!®, Mutant®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Punch
Monster®, Juice Monster®,  Hydro® (stylized), Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Espresso
Monster®, Caffé Monster®, Monster MAXX®, Reign Total Body Fuel™, Reign InfernoTM, BU®,
Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized),
Relentless®, Predator®, Live+® and BPM® to be our core trademarks. We also own the intellectual
property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in
perpetuity.
We have registered Monster®, Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the
Beast!®, Mutant®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice
Monster®, M Hydro®, Espresso Monster®, Caffé Monster®, Monster MAXX®, BU®, Nalu®, Burn®,
Mother®, Play®, Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, Ultra Energy®, BPM®, Live+®, Reign®, Reign
Total Body Fuel® and Reign InfernoTM outside of the United States in certain jurisdictions.
We protect our trademarks by applying for registrations and registering our trademarks with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office and with government agencies in other countries around the
world, particularly where our products are distributed and sold.  We assert copyright ownership of the
statements, graphics and content appearing on the packaging of our products and in our marketing
materials.  We aggressively pursue individuals and/or entities seeking to profit from the unauthorized use
of our trademarks and copyrights, including, without limitation, wholesalers, street vendors, retailers,
online auction site sellers and website operators. In addition to initiating civil actions against these
individuals and entities, we work with law enforcement officials where appropriate.
Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic.
 Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.
We also enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or disparaging
our trademarks by opposing registration of conflicting trademarks and initiating litigation as necessary.
Government Regulation
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to
various U.S. federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes;
the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“California Proposition 65”) and a number
of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale,
safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the

Table of Contents
15United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous
statutes and regulations.
We also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations
or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors – Changes in
government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations” below for additional information.
Furthermore, legislation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal,
state and municipal level in respect of each of the subject areas discussed below.  Public health officials
and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity,
especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of
sweetened beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages, as
discussed below, and we are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy drinks.
Product Formulation, Labeling and Advertising. Globally, we are subject to a number of
regulations applicable to the formulation, labeling and advertising of our products. In California, we are
subject to California Proposition 65, a law which requires that a specified warning be provided before
exposing California consumers to any product that contains in excess of threshold amounts of a substance
listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. California Proposition
65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product
in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a listed substance that is below that
threshold amount, which is determined either by scientific criteria set forth in applicable regulations or
via a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established by the state, or the substance is naturally occurring,
is the result of necessary cooking, or is subject to another applicable exception. If we are required to add
warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold,
it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an adverse impact on
sales of our products in those locations or elsewhere.
In addition, in May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) revised
regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products,
including a new requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. These changes
went into effect on January 1, 2020, though FDA announced that it will not enforce these provisions for
the first six months after that date. Further, in December 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
promulgated regulations requiring that, by January 1, 2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods
must include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. We may incur significant costs to alter our
existing packaging materials to comply with these and other new regulations. Additionally, these new
regulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by
consumers.
Further, the City of San Francisco enacted an ordinance that would require health warnings on
advertisements for certain sugar-sweetened beverages, though enforcement has been delayed due to a
lawsuit challenging the ordinance. In January 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
sitting en banc, granted a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the ordinance, concluding that a
First Amendment challenge to the ordinance was likely to succeed on the merits.  In September 2019, two
members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors introduced legislation to amend the ordinance. The
district court expressed its intent to assess the possible mootness of the current ordinance in light of the
legislative proposal, but has granted the parties’ requests to delay further action pending expected
legislative consideration of the proposed amendment.
In July 2012, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General for the State of New York in
connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and
sale of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. We cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and
what effect, if any, it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Table of Contents
16Other countries, such as the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Yemen, Colombia,
Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and the People’s Republic of China are also considering new
labeling requirements, which may require us to amend our labels and warning statements. The United
Kingdom Government has also suggested that it may review food labeling laws following the United
Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (“Brexit”).
Age and Other Restrictions on Energy Drink Products. Proposals to limit or restrict the sale
and/or advertising of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age, and/or restrict the
venues in which energy drinks can be sold, and/or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised and/or enacted in
certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and/or in certain foreign countries. For example, in the United
States, bills seeking to impose an age restriction on the sale of energy drinks have been introduced in the
South Carolina and Connecticut legislatures.  Outside of the United States, for example, Latvia, Lithuania
and Turkey prohibit the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18; Canada prohibits the
promotion of energy drinks to children 12 years and under; Latvia and Scotland prohibit the sale of
energy drinks in educational establishments; and Turkey prohibits the sale or advertising of energy drinks
in “collective consumption areas.” Latin American countries such as Chile, Colombia and Brazil are
considering age and other sales restrictions on energy drinks, as are other European countries such as the
United Kingdom, Romania and Bulgaria, and in the Middle East, there have been discussions of an age
restriction for energy drinks.
Excise Taxes on Energy Drinks. Legislation that would impose an excise tax on sweetened
beverages has been proposed in the U.S. Congress, in some state legislatures and by some local
governments, with excise taxes generally ranging between $0.01 and $0.02 per ounce of sweetened
beverage.  Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction to pass such a measure, and a general tax of
$0.01 per ounce on certain sweetened drinks, including energy drinks, became effective on January 1,
2015. Other U.S. jurisdictions (including Albany, Oakland and San Francisco, California; Boulder,
Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Seattle, Washington) have passed similar measures, some of
which have been challenged in litigation. The imposition of such taxes on our products would increase
the cost of certain of our products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make certain of our
products less affordable. Excise taxes on sweetened beverages already are in effect in certain foreign
countries where we do business, such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa and Mexico.
 Other countries, including Brazil, are considering similar measures. In addition, legislation has been
proposed in certain jurisdictions that would specifically impose excise taxes on energy drinks. For
example, Estonia, Poland and Ukraine are considering proposals that would impose an excise tax on
energy drinks. Such targeted legislation has been passed in other countries. For instance, on January 1,
2020, a reform to a Mexican excise tax went into effect that expanded the definition of an “energy drink”
subject to this tax to include products with any amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a
threshold of 20 milligrams of caffeine per 100 millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and “taurine or
glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other substance that produces similar stimulating effects.”
 Hungary has instituted an excise tax to which our products are subject. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates began applying a selective tax of 100% on energy drinks in 2017, Qatar and Oman
began applying the tax in 2019, and there are indications that a similar measure may be enacted in
Kuwait.
Limits on Caffeine Content. Legislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that
may be contained in beverages, including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have
prescribed limited caffeine content for beverages. For example, on January 1, 2013, new requirements
took effect in Canada that limited the amount of caffeine contained in any beverage in a single-serving
can or bottle to less than 180 milligrams, and imposed limits on the concentration levels for caffeine. We
adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy® products that are sold in Canada to address
these regulations, although the majority of our products were unaffected.  In Europe, examples of
caffeine restrictions include the Netherlands where there is a limit of 35mg/100ml, and Norway
introduced, as of January 1, 2020 (subject to transition periods), a limit of 32mg/100ml.  Caffeine limit
restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients or in particular product sectors
(such as performance beverages/sport drinks) have also been implemented or proposed in other
jurisdictions, including Turkey, India and Pakistan’s Punjab region. Such restrictions
Table of Contents
17could require reformulations of certain of our products. However, we may not be able to satisfactorily
reformulate our products in all jurisdictions that adopt similar legislation.
Limitations on Container Size. We package our products in a variety of different package types
and sizes including, for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, aluminum cans larger than
16 fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions, such as the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council,
Yemen, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic, are considering container size limitations on energy
drinks and other beverages which may require us to change the size of our products sold in these
countries.  Other countries, like England, have considered and rejected proposed can size limitations
although it is open to such markets to revisit these and other similar proposals.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar laws and regulations that may be
applicable in such countries. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such
compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive
position.
Container Deposits. Various municipalities, states and foreign countries require that a deposit be
charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these
measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been, and
may in the future be, introduced in certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and in certain foreign
countries.
In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such
redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based
upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain
other states and countries where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our
customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and
bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed a total of 3,529 employees, of which 2,655 were
employed on a full-time basis. Of our 3,529 employees, we employed 1,107 in administrative and
operational capacities and 2,422 persons in sales and marketing capacities.

ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the
consolidated financial statements and related notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. If
any of the following risks actually occur or continue to occur, our business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. The risk factors summarized
below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that
we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation,
financial condition and/or operating results.
The Company and TCCC have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the Company’s future
performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with TCCC.
We have transitioned all third parties’ rights to distribute the Company’s products in the U.S. to
members of TCCC’s distribution network, which largely consists of independent bottlers/distributors. In
addition, TCCC has become our preferred distribution partner globally with members of TCCC’s network
distributing our products internationally, including in Africa, Asia, Canada, Central and South America,
Europe, Mexico and the Middle East. As we continue our international expansion, we expect TCCC’s
distribution network to continue as our preferred distribution partner globally. As a result, we have
reduced our distributor diversification and are now substantially dependent on TCCC’s domestic and
international distribution platforms.
TCCC has a substantial equity investment in the Company. The Company, TCCC and certain
affiliates are parties to various agreements in which TCCC and certain affiliates have agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category in certain territories prior to the
termination of the applicable distribution coordination agreement with TCCC. The Company’s
distribution agreements with TCCC distributors also provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the
applicable distributor will not distribute competitive energy drink products.
While we believe that these agreements incentivize TCCC to take steps to ensure that our
products receive the appropriate attention in the TCCC distribution system, there can be no assurance of
this as disagreements as to the interpretation of the provisions in such agreements may arise and TCCC is
a much larger company with many strategic priorities. In October 2018, the Company and TCCC
mutually agreed to submit to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association the issue of whether
TCCC is permitted to manufacture, market, sell or distribute three energy drink products it developed.
 On June 28, 2019, the arbitration tribunal issued a final award in favor of TCCC.  TCCC launched Coca-
Cola Energy in Europe in 2019 and in the United States in 2020.  As TCCC proceeds to launch Coca-
Cola Energy in additional territories, we may encounter difficulties in maintaining distributor attention,
market share or position in the energy drink category in such territories, which could adversely affect our
business and operating results.
In addition, TCCC does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are
independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with TCCC’s
interests. Moreover, it is possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new
distribution arrangements regardless of TCCC’s priorities or the priorities of the members of TCCC’s
distribution system.

19We derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink
category could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes
impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the
trading price of our common stock.
Virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks, our Reign Total Body FuelTM energy drinks and our Strategic Brands energy drinks
(including our affordable brand energy drinks, principally Predator®). Any decrease in the sales of our
Monster Energy® brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues
and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the
energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. Domestically, our energy drinks compete
directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Amp, Venom, VPX Redline, Xenergy, Xyience, MiO Energy, Rip It,
Starbucks Doubleshot, Starbucks Doubleshot Energy Plus Coffee, Starbucks Tripleshot, Costa Coffee,
Nescafe, Rockstar Roasted, VPX Bang, V8+ Energy, UPTIME, hi*ball, CELSIUS, C4, Quake,
Adrenaline Shoc, Coca-Cola Energy, 5-Hour Energy Shots, Stacker 2, and many other brands.  In
addition, certain large companies, such as PepsiCo, market and/or distribute products in that market
segment, such as Pepsi Max, Gatorade Bolt 24, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel and
Mountain Dew Kickstart.
Internationally, our energy drinks compete with Red Bull (including non-carbonated Red Bull in
China and Asia), Rockstar, V-Energy, Lucozade, Coca-Cola Energy and numerous local and private-label
brands that usually differ from country to country, such as HELL, Amper, Shock, Tiger, Boost, Speed,
TNT, Shark, Hot 6, Shark Energy, Dragon, Score, Sting, Battery, Bullit, Flash Up, Black, Non-Stop,
Bomba, Semtex, Vive 100, Dark Dog, Guarana, M-150, Lipovitan, Bacchus, Volt, Bolt, Mr. Big, Boom,
Raptor, Amp, Fusion, Hi-Tiger, Eastroc Super Drink, Carabao, Power Horse, XL, Crazy Tiger, Effect,

with Starbucks Frappuccino, Starbucks Doubleshot, Starbucks Doubleshot Energy Plus Coffee, Starbucks
Tripleshot and other Starbucks coffee drinks, Costa Coffee, Nescafe, Douwe Egberts Coffee, Emmi
CAFFÈ, Bang Keto Coffee, Rockstar Roasted, Dunkin Donuts, Gold Peak Tea, Stok, High Brew,
McCafé, hi*ball and International Delight.
Our Muscle Monster® product line competes directly with Muscle Milk, Core Power, Premier
Protein, Kellogg’s Special K Protein, Bolthouse Farms Protein, EAS AdvantEDGE, EAS Myoplex,
Gatorade G Series 03 Recover and PowerBar.
Our Monster Hydro® and Monster HydroSport Super Fuel® product lines compete directly with
Vitamin Water, Sparkling Ice, Bai, Propel, Vita Coco, Lucozade, Powerade, Gatorade Bolt 24 and
BODYARMOR.
Our Reign Total Body FuelTM and Reign InfernoTM Thermogenic Fuel high performance energy
drinks compete with VPX Bang, Adrenaline Shoc, C4, Quake, Rockstar XDURANCE and CELSIUS in
the performance energy category.
The increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space in retail stores
may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace. In addition,
certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, false advertising
claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as competitors selling misbranded products,
could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues,
cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations.

20The Company, in several markets, owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink

Our various Monster Energy® brand energy drinks compete with one another, and, in several
markets, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and Strategic Brands compete with each other. We
may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets,
which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
TCCC is a significant shareholder of the Company and may have interests that are different from the
Company’s other shareholders (including current shareholders of the Company).
As of February 20, 2020, TCCC owned common shares of the Company representing
approximately 19% of the total number of the Company’s outstanding common shares. TCCC has also
nominated one director to the Company’s board of directors.
TCCC’s ownership could also have an effect on the Company’s ability to engage in a change in
control transaction. TCCC is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the
Company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common
shares not owned by TCCC with respect to a proposal for a change of control. However, if TCCC were to
oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders
of 62.5% of the Company’s common shares not owned by TCCC (assuming that TCCC increased its
ownership to 20% of the Company’s common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the Company’s
outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. In addition, TCCC would have a bidding
advantage if the Company’s board of directors were to seek to sell the Company in the future because
TCCC would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. TCCC and the
Company would also be permitted to terminate TCCC’s distribution coordination agreements with the
Company after a change in control of the Company. In such event, TCCC would receive a termination fee
if TCCC terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the
Company involving certain TCCC competitors, or if the Company terminated following a change in
control of the Company involving any third-party.
The interests of TCCC may be different from or conflict with the interests of the Company’s
other shareholders and, as a result, TCCC’s influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential
actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of the Company, even if
such action or transaction may be beneficial to the Company’s other shareholders. Moreover, TCCC’s
ownership of a significant amount of the Company’s outstanding common shares could result in
downward pressure on the trading price of the Company’s common shares if TCCC were to sell a large
portion of its shares or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur.
Changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level
and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks
(including, prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain
governmental programs), limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages, require certain
product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age
restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. For a discussion of certain of such legislation, see “Part I, Item 1
– Business – Government Regulation.” Furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the
United States and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the
foregoing subject areas.  For instance, on January 1, 2020, a reform to a Mexican excise tax went into
effect that expanded the definition of an “energy drink” subject to this tax to include products with any
amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a threshold of 20 milligrams of caffeine per 100
millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and “taurine or glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other
substance that produces similar stimulating effects.”  Public health officials and health advocates are
increasingly focused on the
Table of Contents
21public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking
legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages.  There also has been increased
focus on caffeine content in beverages, and we are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy
drinks. To the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant
amount of our products are sold, individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand
for, or availability of, our energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are also
currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the FD&C Act; the
Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; data privacy laws; California
Proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the
production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the
United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous
statutes and regulations.  If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product, its label, or a
production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or the products in
question may have to be recalled, removed from the market, reformulated and/or have the packaging
changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We cannot predict the effect of possible inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other
government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing,
promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products.
We are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general
and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing,
promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks, and we are a party, from time to time, to
various government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings.  Defending these proceedings can result
in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management’s time and attention from the
operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations.
In addition, from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate
the safety of caffeine and energy drinks. For example, in January 2013, the Company received and
responded to inquiries from U.S. legislators in response to FDA’s investigation into the safety of caffeine
in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents. These legislators ultimately released
a report in January 2015, recommending, inter alia, that the energy drink industry not market to
consumers under the age of 18 and not market their products for hydration, and that the FDA develop and
release definitions and guidance for this market sector.  In addition, other organizations, such as the
European Food Safety Authority, have also published reports, studies, articles and opinions on caffeine
and energy drinks.  If an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government
agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or
sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject
to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink
products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to
significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products, thus negatively affecting our financial results.
We have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal
proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false
advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative
actions.  In particular, we have been and are currently named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits
which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries.
We do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries, and we
intend to vigorously defend such lawsuits.
Table of Contents
22Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our
advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in
compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that our products are not safe. Putative class
action lawsuits have also been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their
advertisements amount to false advertising.  We do not believe any statements made by us in our
promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with
local law, or that our products are in any way unsafe and we vigorously defend these lawsuits.
Any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention
arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and
managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards
against us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation.  Our failure
to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the
extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
Criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks
generally, could adversely affect us.
An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity
regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally,
including product safety concerns, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks
and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. We
believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the U.S. may have been negatively impacted by
the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety
of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine), and/or the levels
thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. In early 2018, certain retailers in the
United Kingdom announced the introduction of voluntary retailer measures to prevent the sale of energy
drinks to individuals under the age of 16. If reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy
drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, or additional voluntary measures are taken,
they could adversely affect the demand for our products.
Increased competition in the beverage industry and changing retail landscape could hurt our business.
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing,
packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and
marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large
number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution
resources than we do.
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our
products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting
edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products
compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially
better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known
producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Red Bull GmbH and KDP. We also compete with companies that are
smaller or primarily national or local in operations. Our products also compete with private-label brands
such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.
The rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce
applications and subscription services, and closures of physical retail operations, may result in a shift
away from physical retail operations to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases.  As we
build our e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships
with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with
key customers operating physical retail channels.  Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on
a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices.  
Table of Contents
Sales in gas chains may also be affected by improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer
preferences for electric or alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by
consumers to gas stations and a corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas
retailers. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of
sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.
Due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter
difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. If our
revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting edge products could adversely affect
our business and financial results.
Our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business
growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The
success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to
consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial
condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.
Uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political
conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry,
business and results of operations.
Global economic uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange rates, affect businesses such
as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business
activities. There can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be
sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. In addition, we cannot
predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our
customers or business, as our expansion outside of the United States has increased our exposure to any
developments or crises in African, Asian, European and other international markets. Unfavorable
economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets and unstable political
conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other international markets
could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing
demand for our products.  Included in the foregoing are uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom’s
withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and any
resulting increases in tariffs, importation restrictions, out of stocks, volatility in currency exchange rates,
including the valuation of the euro and the British pound in particular, changes in the laws and
regulations applied in the United Kingdom or impacts on economic and market conditions in the United
Kingdom, the European Union and its member states and elsewhere.
Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for some of our products.
The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer
preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness
and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened
beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. Some consumer advocacy groups and
others have expressed concerns regarding certain ingredients in diet sodas, which are contained in certain
of our energy drinks.  This may reduce demand for our beverages, which could reduce our revenues and
adversely affect our results of operations.
Consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend, in part,
upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to
consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce
different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and price, although
there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to
purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products and/or
packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change. The beverages we
currently
23
Table of Contents
market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such beverages
will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product
and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as shopping
patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with customers embracing shopping by way of mobile
device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be unable to
address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences. If our revenues decline, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks
in international markets.
We have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets,
including launches in China and various African and Middle Eastern countries. Our gross sales to
customers outside of the United States were approximately 33%, 31% and 28% of consolidated gross
sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As our growth strategy
includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution
of our products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected. In many
international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some international markets we have
no operating experience. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and
develop and promote our brands in international markets. Our percentage gross profit margins in many
international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins
obtained in the United States. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having
foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets;
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign
profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations;
and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our
products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, our operations outside of the United States
are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local
jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages,
particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or
corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.
Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our
business.
Because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political
conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or
other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of
armed hostilities, major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires,
tornados, earthquakes or floods, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Such catastrophic events
could impact our operations and our supply chain, including the production and/or distribution of our
products.  Materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a
large part of our operations are located in California, a state at greater risk of earthquakes and wildfires.
 Some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers,
and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations.  In
addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer
purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our
products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors,
our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
Our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers, may be adversely affected by the recent
coronavirus (or COVID-19) outbreak.
We and our suppliers currently globally source certain ingredients for our products from third-
party manufacturers in Wuhan (Hubei Province) and other parts of China, manufacture finished goods
through third-party bottlers and co-packers
24
Table of Contents
in China and have employees in China.  The recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the
coronavirus (or COVID-19), and other adverse public health developments, could adversely affect our
business and cause disruptions due to the closure or suspension of activities at such third-party
manufacturers as well as at our co-packing facilities and our China office. Certain aspects of our
operations currently in China may need to be moved, even temporarily, to other locations.  In addition,
the outbreak, together with any accompanying special government measures, including general
movement restrictions, travel restrictions and business closures imposed to slow its spread, could
adversely impact the growth of our business in China and affect demand for our products, negatively
impacting our results of operations and financial condition.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses,
profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may enter into
forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to
specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated
subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. We have not used instruments to
hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency
fluctuations. As a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. Moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. Foreign currency transaction losses
were $4.1 million, $4.0 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively.
Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur
significant losses.
As part of any hedging activities that we may conduct, we may enter into transactions involving
derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option
contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. We also have significant amounts of cash,
cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions
both in the United States and abroad, exposing us to risk of default by or failure of such counterparty
financial institutions. This risk of counterparty default or failure is greater during periods of economic
downturn or uncertainty in financial markets. If one of our counterparties became insolvent or filed for
bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred due to the default or to retrieve assets deposited or held
in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or applicable laws
governing insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings. Default by or failure of one or more of our
counterparties could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations
and financial condition.
We rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain
good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our
products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.
Our acquisition of AFF in 2016 brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of
our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. However, we also procure flavors from other independent
flavor suppliers. We do not manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource manufacturing of our
finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. As a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay,
we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within
a reasonably short time period. In addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic
and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products,
including certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, our Muscle Monster® product line, our
Java Monster® product line, our Espresso Monster® product line, our Caffé Monster® product line, our
Monster Hydro® product line and certain of our other products. For example, in recent years, sales of our
Java Monster® and Muscle Monster® product lines were adversely impacted by production capacity
constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with certain of our co-packers. While this
disruption in production did not significantly affect our revenues, a lengthy disruption or delay in the
production of any of our products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products,
because alternative co-packing facilities in the United States and abroad with adequate long-
25
Table of Contents
26term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs
and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all. In addition, recently there has been a consolidation
of co-packers.  If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our largest co-packers, or if our costs
of co-packing increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our
business could suffer.
Many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda,
carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).
In many cases, such products compete directly with our products.
Unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains,
grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying certain or
all of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer.
The TCCC North American Bottlers, Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-
Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola (China), COFCO Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Beverages
Africa and Coca-Cola İçecek are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. As a
result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the TCCC North American Bottlers, Coca-
Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola
(China), COFCO Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and/or Coca-Cola İçecek; or if the TCCC
North American Bottlers, Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-
Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola (China), COFCO Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and/or Coca-
Cola İçecek; do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products,
sales of our products could be adversely affected. As TCCC proceeds to launch Coca-Cola Energy in
additional territories, we may encounter difficulties in maintaining distributor attention, market share or
position in the energy drink category in such territories, which could adversely affect our business and
operating results.
A decision by certain TCCC North American Bottlers (including Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc.
and Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC), Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola
FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola (China), COFCO Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,
Coca-Cola İçecek, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam’s Club), or any other large customer to decrease the
amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If our brands prove to be
less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers and
distributors, and/or our bottlers/distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products
effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-
packing could harm our business.
The principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap
cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, caps, flavors, juice concentrates, glucose,
sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, coffee, tea, cocoa, supplement ingredients and other packaging
materials, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. For certain flavors purchased
from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks
and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to
certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or
formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates, and
we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice.
Our third-party flavor suppliers
Table of Contents
generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers.
We have identified alternative suppliers for certain of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages.
However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, cocoa, dairy-based
products, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be,
encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. Ingredient
sourcing delays following the coronavirus (or COVID-19) outbreak could also interfere with and/or delay
production of certain of our products. In addition, certain of our co-packing arrangements allow such co-
packers to increase their fees based on certain of their own cost increases. We are uncertain whether the
prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen,
will continue to rise or may rise in the future. We are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such
increases on to our customers. Although we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative
instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, from
time to time, we, through our aluminum can suppliers, enter into purchase agreements for the purchase of
aluminum, as well as enter into purchase agreements for portions of our annual anticipated requirements
for certain of our other raw materials such as glucose, sugar and sucralose. In 2018, the United States
imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other
countries.  Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further
retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in
supply chain costs.
Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and
financial results.
We may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability
to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be
less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate
demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not
limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable
ends, PET plastic bottles, caps, labels, sucralose, flavors, supplement ingredients, juice concentrates,
certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, cocoa, protein and packaging materials or experience difficulties with our
co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to
satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates,
supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be
experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. We generally do not use
hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with
and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial results.
If we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels, if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers
in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers’ or retailers’ inventory levels are too high, our operating
results could be adversely affected.
If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will
take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may
be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships
with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be
delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain
adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors
and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably
impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results.
The costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time, and we may be unable to
pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers.
Many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for
packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce
those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, PET plastic for bottles and pulp and paper for
cartons and/or trays. These changes in the prices we pay
27
Table of Contents
for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. In
some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a
reasonable period. In other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies,
including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. We do not use
derivative instruments to manage this risk. If the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be
unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we
charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially
adversely affect our business.
We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. We also own the copyright
in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. We regard our trademarks,
copyrights and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such
intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. However, there can be no assurance
that other parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary
rights. In 2019, Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“VPX”) announced its intention to launch its own line of
“Reign”-branded energy drinks in 16-ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores.  We filed an expedited
motion for a preliminary injunction to stop this product launch and to prevent this infringement of our
trademarks, and in January 2020 the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the
injunction be granted in our favor.  A number of proceedings are currently ongoing to adjudicate claims,
including claims for false advertising and trademark infringement, brought by the Company against VPX
and by VPX against the Company.  Certain proceedings could result in an injunction barring us from
selling “Reign Total Body Fuel” branded energy drinks and/or require changes to be made to our current
trade dress.  If we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, or an injunction prevents us from
selling any of our products, our business may be materially adversely affected.
Negative publicity (whether or not warranted) concerning product safety or quality, human and
workplace rights, obesity or other issues could damage our brand image and corporate reputation, and
may cause our business to suffer.
Our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing
products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no
assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product
safety and quality and human rights will have the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on
consumer preferences and demand. Product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or
lack thereof (real or imagined), our environmental impact, or allegations of product contamination, even
if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose
other products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we, our employees,
 bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are
perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially irresponsible manner,
including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of our
customers, or the use of customer data.  Furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could
be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in
general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or
those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry.  Negative postings or
comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands, even if
inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands
or the Company.  Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our
bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce
brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on our
reputation and financial results.  The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive
considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons)
or result in litigation.
In addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to
our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the
subject of backlash from advocacy groups
28
Table of Contents
29that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including
product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a
result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor
or support.  Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain, with human and
workplace rights or animal rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. We
have made a number of commitments to respect human rights, including the policies and initiatives
described in our California Transparency in Supply Chains Act & United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act
statement, available on our website at www.monsterbevcorp.com/sr-transparency.php. Allegations, even
if untrue, that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business
partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their
actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and
health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like
could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a
negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers.
If we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses.
We may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers,
markets, retailers or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise
materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. A material product recall could
adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. We do not maintain recall insurance.
If we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management, there may be an adverse effect on
our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements.
Our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. We do
not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. The loss of services of
either Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hilton Schlosberg, Vice Chairman,
President and Chief Financial Officer, or any other key members of our senior management could
adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of
personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ
such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.
Climate change may negatively affect our business.
There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns
around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer
weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns
could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases or other
health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice
concentrates, supplements and other ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security
of communities around the world.  Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could
also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain (including, without limitation, the
availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and other ingredients)
and/or impact demand for our products. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as
hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, may affect our operations and the operation of our supply
chain, impact the operations of our bottlers/distributors and unfavorably impact our consumers’ ability to
purchase our products. The predicted effects of climate change may also result in challenges regarding
availability and quality of water, or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our
business and results of operations. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to
make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could
have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Sales of our products may also
be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. We, our bottlers
and our
Table of Contents
contract packers use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our beverage products that are
derived from agricultural commodities such as sugar, coffee, tea and cocoa. Increased demand for food
products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing
weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural
commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world.  Weather conditions
may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an effect on our
operations, either positively or negatively.
Potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our
financial results.
We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have
on our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect
our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income.
Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage
containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our
products’ affordability and reduce our sales.
Fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
Therefore, we are subject to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once.
We are in various stages of examination with certain states and certain foreign jurisdictions
including the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our 2016 through 2018 U.S. federal income tax returns are
subject to examination by the IRS. Our state income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2014
through 2018 tax years.
At any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax
audits will be resolved and thus, there could be significant variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax
rates, because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions.
Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or the manner in which U.S. multinational
corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or
enforced, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For example, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has recommended changes to
numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”)
project. These changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance
costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow.  In
connection with the OECD’s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax
authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in
various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we
operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes
more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our
historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of
operations.
Volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities.
Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial
results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market
conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties
as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. We do not
provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product
mix, operating expenses or net income. We may be unable to achieve analysts’ net revenue and/or
earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of
many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their
own estimates of gross margin
30
Table of Contents
31and operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mix
of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. As a result, our stock price
is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices.
In addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities
class action litigation against us. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the high of our stock
price was $66.38 and the low was $47.84.
Provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even
if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.
Our organizational documents may limit changes in control. Furthermore, as of February 20,
2020, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting
control over approximately 10.1% of our outstanding common stock. As of February 20, 2020, TCCC
owned approximately 19% of our common stock. Consequently, Mr. Sacks, Mr. Schlosberg and TCCC
could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing
directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a
takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.
Our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the
liquidity of these investments.
At December 31, 2019, we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $546.0 million in
short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. treasuries,
certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities
(which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting
certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest
rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future
results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become
impaired.
Under GAAP, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be
considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not
be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing
products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry.
We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in which we
determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our
results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, our goodwill totaled approximately $1.33 billion and
other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.05 billion.
If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the Company could be
materially and adversely affected.
We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control
over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in “Part II, Item 9A – Controls and
Procedures.” If we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed.
Table of Contents
We must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including
protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats.
Information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain
financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not
appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper
technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of
customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security
breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and
include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware, ransomware and viruses), phishing and
social engineering, attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data,
malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access)
and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an
inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or
otherwise protected information and corruption of data.
We rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, bottlers, contract
packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other
external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-
party service providers and partners, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar risks as we are
relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee
failures.  While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party
service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or
governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal,
reputational and operational risk.  These third parties may experience cybersecurity incidents that may
involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us.
We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing cybersecurity risk
assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information
technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of
such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image
and private data exposure.
Moreover, if our data management systems, including our SAP enterprise resource planning
system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business
(whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or
human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with
applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could
materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the
timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.
If we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse
publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our
business and operating results.
We receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable
individuals (“personal data”), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business.
As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to
personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in
other jurisdictions at any time. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
became effective in May 2018 for all member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for
companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the European Union different from those
that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance.  Additionally, the
California Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on
January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches
and imposes operational requirements on companies that process personal data of California residents,
including making new disclosures to consumers about data collection, processing and sharing practices
and allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.
32
Table of Contents
33Changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as other changes to existing personal
data protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, subject the Company to,
among other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business
practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. There can be no assurances that our
security controls over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor
management processes, and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the
improper processing or breaches of personal data.  Data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of
personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy
laws and regulations, could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to
government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which may
result in potential loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal
prosecution, thereby negatively impacting our business and operating results.
ITEM 1B.        UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
Not applicable.
ITEM 2.           PROPERTIES
Our principal properties include our corporate headquarters as well as our Southern California
warehouse and distribution center.
Our owned corporate facilities located at 1 Monster Way, Corona, California 92879, consist of (i)
an approximately 141,000 square-foot, free-standing, six-story building (ENERGY STAR certified), (ii)
an approximately 147,625 square-foot three-story parking structure and storage facility, which houses our
approximately 14,000 square-foot quality control laboratory, (iii) an approximately 75,426 square foot,
free-standing, three-story building (pursuing ENERGY STAR certification), (iv) an approximately 20,661
square-foot, free-standing, single-story building and (v) an approximately 49,617 square-foot, free-
standing, two-story building.
Our owned Southern California warehouse and distribution center is located in Rialto, California,
consisting of an approximately 1,000,000 square-foot building which is LEED certified.
During 2019, we acquired a manufacturing plant and adjoining land in Athy, County Kildare,
Ireland. We intend to utilize the facility to produce and supply ingredients for certain of our international
markets.
During 2019, we purchased approximately 7.66 acres of land in San Fernando, California.  We
intend to construct a new production facility on such land in order to consolidate AFF’s operations into a
single location.  
In addition, we lease many smaller office and/or warehouse spaces, both domestically and in
certain international locations.
ITEM 3.          LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is currently a defendant in a number of personal injury lawsuits, claiming that the
death or other serious injury of the plaintiffs was caused by consumption of Monster Energy® brand
energy drinks. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege strict product liability, negligence, fraudulent
concealment, breach of implied warranties and wrongful death. The Company believes that each
complaint is without merit and plans a vigorous defense. The Company also believes that any damages, if
awarded, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations.
Furthermore, from time to time in the normal course of business, the Company is named in other
litigation, including consumer class actions, intellectual property litigation and claims from prior
distributors. Although it is not possible to
Table of Contents
34predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to the Company, management
believes that such litigation in aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.
The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other
matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued, if any, or in
the amount of any related insurance reimbursements recorded. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet included accrued loss contingencies of approximately $15.5 million.

38ITEM 7.          MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (“MD&A”) is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our
financial statements and the accompanying notes (“Notes”) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current
expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ
materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes
the following sections:
●Our Business – a general description of our business, the value drivers of our business, and
opportunities and risks facing our Company, stock repurchases, acquisitions and divestitures;
●Results of Operations – an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the
three years presented in our financial statements;
●Sales – details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases;

Our net sales of $4.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented record annual
net sales. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were positively impacted by approximately
$101.9 million as a result of a price increase effective from November 1, 2018 in the United States (“the
U.S. Price Increase”) and effective from February 1, 2019 in Canada (the “Canada Price Increase”), on
certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had
an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $69.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019.
The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Net
sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $3.90 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 Net sales of our Strategic Brands segment were $274.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment represented 92.9% and 91.9% of our net sales for the years ended

our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Other segment
represented 0.5% and 0.6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively.
Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the
Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Strategic
Brands segment of approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers

TCCC, through the TCCC Subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 2%, 3% and 18% of our net
sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As part of TCCC’s North
America Refranchising, the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain
independent TCCC bottlers/distributors and/or TCCC Related Parties. Accordingly, our percentage of net
sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries significantly decreased for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017.
Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales for the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Coca-Cola European Partners accounted for approximately 10%, 10% and 9% of the Company’s
net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new
products and flavors.
Value Drivers of our Business
We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:
●International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our
Monster Energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth.
One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 153 countries and territories
worldwide.
Table of Contents
41●Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added brands supported by marketing
and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We
continue to broaden our family of products to provide more alternatives to consumers and
launched Reign Total Body FuelTM high performance energy drinks in the first quarter of
2019. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks
segment and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging,
pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are
implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.
●Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing
input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and
co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities
strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances,
selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional
and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.
●Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working
capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that
with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low
effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days
outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.
We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these
value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in:
(1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over
time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of
capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of
operations.
Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share
represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key
management focus in 2020 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Results of Operations – Results of
Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018”).
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had working capital of $1.66 billion compared to $1.20
billion as of December 31, 2018. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the $1.12
billion of net income earned during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31,
2019, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.11 billion as compared to $1.16
billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Principal uses of cash flows in 2019, were purchases of
investments, repurchase of our common stock, development of our Monster Energy® brand
internationally and acquisitions of property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are
expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See
“Part II, Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).
Opportunities, Challenges and Risks
Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage
industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s
status as a significant shareholder of the Company, in each case as described above under
“Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or
municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy
drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain
governmental programs), limit caffeine content, require
Table of Contents
42certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age
restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy
drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been
published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the
future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely
affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international
economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company.
Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to
risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful
marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health
problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that
obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our
broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink
product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation,
choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).
Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative
beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part,
upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet
consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and
expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages
and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual
property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may
adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.
In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial
results include, but are not limited to:
●the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;
●the impact of TCCC’s bottlers/distributors distributing Coca-Cola brand energy drinks;
●changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;
●economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;
●the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
●maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;
●increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including
obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and
consumer preferences in response to those concerns;
●profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place
(See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and
Marketing”);
●costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;
●increase in costs of raw materials used by us;
●restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government
regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients
due to port strikes, related labor issues or other importation impediments;
●protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the
continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for
our expanding product lines;
●limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans in general as well as certain package
containers and lids such as the aluminum 24-ounce cap can and resealable lids;
●limitations on co-packing availability, particularly for retort production as well for 550ml
products utilizing BRE resealable lids;
Table of Contents
43●the impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom; and
●the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy
drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings,
imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions.
See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties
facing our Company.
We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:
●domestic and international growth potential of our products;
●growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally;
●planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of
increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;
●the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;
●package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;
●effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;
●broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;
●launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and
international markets and channels; and
●continued focus on reducing our cost base.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended
December 31, 2018.
Net Sales. Net sales were $4.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
approximately $393.6 million, or 10.3% higher than net sales of $3.81 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were positively impacted by
approximately $101.9 million as a result of the U.S. Price Increase and the Canada Price Increase, on
certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had
44an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $69.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019.
Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $3.90 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $405.6 million, or 11.6% higher than net sales of $3.50
billion for the year ended December 31,
Table of Contents
452018. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to (i) sales of our
Reign Total Body FuelTM high performance energy drinks, introduced in the first quarter of 2019, (ii) the
price increases described above, and (iii) increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange
rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately
$59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $274.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, a decrease of approximately $10.9 million, or 3.8% lower than net sales of $285.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable
impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $9.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.
Net sales for the Other segment were $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a
decrease of approximately $1.1 million, or 4.6% lower than net sales of $22.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.
Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 448.8 million cases for the year ended December
31, 2019, an increase of approximately 37.9 million cases or 9.2% higher than case sales of 410.9 million
cases for the year ended December 31, 2018. The overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales
of AFF Third-Party Products of $21.9 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) increased to $9.31 for the year
ended December 31, 2019, which was 1.1% higher than the average net sales per case of $9.21 for the
year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase in the average net sales per case was primarily attributable
to a price increase effective from November 1, 2018 in the United States and effective from February 1,
2019 in Canada, on certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
approximately $223.2 million, or 9.7% higher than the gross profit of $2.30 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $405.6 million
increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 60.0% for the year ended December 31,
2019 from 60.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease for the year ended December 31,
2019 was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset
by the sales price increases discussed above.
Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.12 billion for the year ended December
31, 2019, an increase of approximately $103.9 million, or 10.3% higher than total operating expenses of
$1.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in operating expenses was primarily
due to increased payroll expenses of $36.0 million (of which $6.2 million was related to an increase in
stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $25.1 million for professional service fees,
including legal and accounting costs, increased expenditures of $13.4 million for sponsorships and
endorsements, and increased expenditures of $19.1 million in other marketing expenses. The increase in
operating expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $15.4 million related to the costs
associated with distributor terminations. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019
included a $15.5 million provision in connection with an intellectual property claim brought by the
descendants of Hubert Hansen in relation to the Company’s use of the Hubert Hansen name prior to the
transaction with TCCC, that closed in 2015.
Operating Income. Operating income was $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019,
an increase of approximately $119.3 million, or 9.3% higher than operating income of $1.28 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 33.4% and 33.7%
for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Operating income was
$229.2 million and $180.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in
connection with our operations in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia Pacific and South
America.

Operating income* for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was $1.57 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $195.0 million, or 14.2% higher than operating
income of $1.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in operating income for the

tax rate decreased to 21.8% from 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in equity compensation
deductions.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by increased income taxes in
certain foreign jurisdictions.
Net Income. Net income was $1.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of
$114.8 million, or 11.6% higher than net income of $993.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2018. The increase in net income was primarily due to the $223.2 million increase in gross profit. The
increase in net income was partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of $103.9 million and an
increase in the provision for income taxes of $7.9 million.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended

billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the
year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted by approximately $17.4 million as a result of
the adoption of ASC 606. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net
sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $14.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to
increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased domestic
and international consumer demand.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $285.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, a decrease of approximately $14.0 million, or 4.7% lower than net sales of $299.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2017. Net

sales for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 were negatively impacted
by approximately $24.9 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. Net changes in foreign currency
exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales for the Strategic Brands segment of approximately
$0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Net sales for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an
increase of approximately $1.3 million, or 6.1% higher than net sales of $21.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017.
Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 410.9 million cases for the year ended December
31, 2018, an increase of approximately 50.9 million cases or 14.1% higher than case sales of 360.0
million cases for the year ended December 31, 2017. The overall average net sales per case (excluding
net sales of AFF Third-Party Products of $22.9 million and $21.6 million for the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.21 for
the year ended December 31, 2018, which was 1.0% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.30
for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the adoption of ASC
606, the overall average net sales per case increased to $9.31 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as
compared to average net sales per case of $9.30 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of
approximately $157.7 million, or 7.4% higher than the gross profit of $2.14 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $450.8 million
increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks segment for the year ended December
31, 2018.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 60.3% for the year ended December 31,
2018 from 63.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales,
excluding the impact of ASC 606, was 60.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to (i) increases
in certain input costs, principally aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; (ii) domestic product
sales mix (iii) geographical sales mix, as a result of our international sales increasing as a percentage of
total net sales (our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins); (iv) the $42.2 million of
commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; and (v) increases
in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales.
Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $1.01 billion for the year ended December
31, 2018, an increase of approximately $72.9 million, or 7.8% higher than total operating expenses of
$938.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily
due to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $38.5 million, increased payroll expenses of
$28.6 million (of which $4.8 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased
expenditures of $14.8 million for sponsorships and endorsements, and increased expenditures of $12.1
million for other marketing expenses.  The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the $8.8
million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations. Commissions included in operating
expenses were $16.7 million, or 65.1% lower than commissions included in operating expenses of $47.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Without the adoption of ASC 606, an additional $42.2
million of commissions would have been included in operating expenses for the year ended December
31, 2018 (such commissions are included as a reduction to net sales).
Operating Income. Operating income was $1.28 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018,
an increase of approximately $84.8 million, or 7.1% higher than operating income of $1.20 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2017. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.7% for the
year ended December 31, 2018 from 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating income
was $180.8 million and $139.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in
connection with our operations in EMEA, Asia Pacific and South America.
Operating income* for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was $1.37 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $106.5 million, or 8.4% higher than operating
income of $1.26 billion for the year ended

Table of Contents
48December 31, 2017. The increase in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was
primarily the result of the $455.1 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Operating income* for the Strategic Brands segment was $176.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately $2.1 million, or 1.2% higher than operating income of
$174.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Operating income* for the Other segment was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million, or 4.0% lower than operating income of $5.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2017.
*Exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses.
Other Income, net.  Other non-operating income, net, was $9.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, as compared to other non-operating income, net, of $2.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017. Foreign currency transaction (losses)/gains were ($4.0) million and ($3.3) million
for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest income was $13.8 million and
$6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes was $300.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, a decrease of $80.7 million, or 21.2% lower than the provision for income taxes of
$380.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective combined federal, state and foreign
tax rate decreased to 23.2% from 31.7% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax
rate as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 (before considering the
potential impact of further clarification of certain matters related to the Tax Reform Act), and to a
reduction in certain foreign income that is subject to U.S. taxation.  The decrease in the provision for
income taxes was partially offset by the elimination of the domestic production deduction following the
Tax Reform Act as well as a decrease in the stock based compensation tax deduction.
Net Income. Net income was $993.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase
of $172.3 million, or 21.0% higher than net income of $820.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2017. The increase in net income was primarily due to the $157.7 million increase in gross profit and the
$80.7 million decrease in the provision for income taxes. The increase in net income was partially offset
by the increase in operating expenses of $72.9 million.

**Gross sales are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of
particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows
evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that
the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross sales is not a measure that is recognized
under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in
49
Table of Contents
50accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices.
In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from
payments received from certain customers.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross sales with the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales:

***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the
presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may
not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to
our bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price
promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend
with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to
bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting,
shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors
and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our
bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and
(viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an
evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and
other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs with our numerous
bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally
provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary
drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were (i) to increase sales volume and
trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail.
Sales
The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years.
Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.
Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement
equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means
the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted
into finished products, sold by us.
Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of
increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend
to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our
energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional
beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new
products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more

products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. (See “Part I, Item 1 –

brand in international markets) and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also use
cash to purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible
businesses.
Cash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $628.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.32 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2018. The cash flows used in financing activities for both the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock. The cash
flows provided by financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018 was
primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock.
Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of
property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold
improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance
of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock
are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2019,
we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $533.1 million in short-term investments and $12.9
million in long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. treasuries, U.S.
government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature),
certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting
certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of
speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term
ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our
investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and
investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to
general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment
portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Of our $798.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2019, $416.9 million
was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign
subsidiaries at December 31, 2019.
We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving
line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw
materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and
development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets,
equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital
expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are currently estimated to be approximately
$150.0 million through December 31, 2020.  However, future business opportunities may cause a change
in this estimate.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.  GAAP requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial
statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and
practices:
Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business
Combinations”.  FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the
acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure
goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at
their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.
Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer
than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-
acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure
certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a
business combination.
Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the
year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured
limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to
incur any losses in the future.
Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-
maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are
those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading
securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell
Table of Contents
in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified
as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair
market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to
earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded
within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs,
where available. Under FASB ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily
impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized
cost basis (the difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less
than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security
before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the
charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the
security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost
basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other
comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of
its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by
management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market
and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable,
information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its
cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any
specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the
investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.
Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable
based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is
estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company
believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts,
bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of
past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its
consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional
allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and
related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis.
Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net
realizable value).
Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture
and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on
their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms
of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance
costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are
capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any
resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.
Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition
exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects.
Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value,
the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step
requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A
potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting
55
Table of Contents
56unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential
impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net
assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized
for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments recorded.
Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised of trademarks that represent the Company’s
exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Unleash the Beast!®,
Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Monster Hydro®, Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Espresso
Monster®, Caffé Monster®, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®, Muscle Monster®,
Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Reign Total Body FuelTM, Reign InfernoTM, M3(stylized)®, BU®,
Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized),
Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai®, Predator® and BPM® trademarks, all used in connection with the
manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of
other trademarks, flavors and formulas in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around
the world. In addition, in 2016 through our acquisition of AFF, we secured the intellectual property of our
most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity. In
accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are
measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The
Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their
estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The
Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments recorded.
Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived
assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate
of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is
estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is
inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected
future conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairment
indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are recognized in other income, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or
losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany
transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the
foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we entered into forward currency exchange
contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the
foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency
denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December
31, 2019 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts
for speculation or trading purposes.
Revenue Recognition – The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net
operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service
beverage distributors. In some cases, the

Table of Contents
Company sells directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass
merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value retailers, e-commerce
retailers and the military.
The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
to other bottlers and full service distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club
stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores and the military. To a
lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-
drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors.
The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance
obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the
Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying
contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate
function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products
passes to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or
transferred the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms
are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment
terms. The Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31,
2019 and December 31, 2018.
The Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are
imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers.
Distribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing
expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.
Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales,
primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including,
but not limited to the following:
●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers;
●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their
promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees
for both new and existing products;
●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers
for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;
●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly
to retailers;
●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or
exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;
●discounted or free products;
●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by
the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories;
and
●commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries and/or the TCCC
Related Parties.
The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are
executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally
provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from
one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various
programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for
its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s
historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to
estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences
between such
57
Table of Contents
58estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been
insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.
Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with
certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are
accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements,
generally 20 years.
The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-
party sales of non-beverage products bearing our trademarks including, but not limited to, clothing, hats,
t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and
spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience.
Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases,
the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-
bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the
manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition, the
Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and payroll costs that
relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials
account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers,
flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.
Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses
to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for
advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale
materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses.
Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees
(including legal fees), termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors,
depreciation and other general and administrative costs.
Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set
forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax
rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation
allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future
taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines
that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance
would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to
examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available
at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax
benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially
be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will
be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk
Factors,” for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and
uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the
important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those
expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could
harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described
or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts
and projections, and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not
rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions
only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-
looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report,
in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events
except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
ITEM 7A.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks.
The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices)
to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our
raw materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the
price of aluminum for cans, as well as sugar and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein,
coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel
prices, and limited availability of certain raw materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or
alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw
materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs
because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate.
We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest
rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.
Our gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 33% and 31% of
consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our growth
strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year
Table of Contents
63ended December 31, 2019, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial
institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk
exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets
and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of December 31, 2019 have
terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation
or trading purposes.
We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under
FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized
in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in
the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting
from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31,
2019 to be significant.
As of December 31, 2019, we had $798.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $546.0
million in short-term and long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S.
government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, variable rate demand notes and municipal securities
(which may have an auction reset feature). Certain of these investments are subject to general credit,
liquidity, market and interest rate risks.

ITEM 9A.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures – Under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
(1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of
the SEC and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting – Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2019, based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
management’s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2019.
Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation
report, which is included herein.

65REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Monster Beverage Corporation
Corona, California
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Monster Beverage Corporation
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal
Control —Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established
in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated
February 28, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

72REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Monster Beverage Corporation
Corona, California
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Monster Beverage
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows, for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 28, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of
the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee
and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit
matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Accrued Promotional Allowances — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Table of Contents
73The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with
its bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its
anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed-upon terms as well as the Company’s historical
experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating
consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Promotional and other
allowances primarily include consideration given to bottlers/distributors or retail customers, including,
but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end
consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their
promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees for both new
and existing products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers
for advertising, in-store marketing, and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting, shelf space
allowances, and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given
to bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi)
discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to bottlers/distributors related to sales made by
the Company directly to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and
(viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to bottlers/distributors. The length of promotional
programs can vary from as little as one day, for one-time events, to as long as one year based on the
agreed-upon terms. The nature of such programs is determined on a per retail customer basis, and in
certain instances, the same program is set for multiple retail customers. The promotional expenditures are
recorded as a reduction to net sales in the period the underlying sale occurs. Total promotional
expenditures included as a reduction to net sales were $666.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, and accrued promotional allowances were $166.8 million as of December 31, 2019.
We identified accrued promotional allowances as a critical audit matter because of the extent and
subjective nature of management judgment required with respect to estimating consumer participation
and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels and future promotional claims.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures over accrued promotional allowances, with respect to management’s
judgment regarding levels of consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance
levels and future promotional claims, included the following, among others:
●We tested the effectiveness of controls over accrued promotional allowances, including those
controls pertaining to management’s estimation of future promotional claims.
●We selected a sample of accrued promotional allowances recorded for specific distributors
and retail customers and sent confirmation requests of the accrual recorded and key terms of
the agreement directly to the distributor or retail customer. We compared the confirmation
response to the accrued amount recorded by the Company. In instances of nonreplies to our
confirmation request from the distributor or retail customer, we performed alternative
procedures as follows: (1) developing an expectation of the accrual using current-year claim
and payment data, and/or (2) vouching known claim submissions, unpaid as of period-end, to
underlying supporting documentation.
●We tested the promotional expenditure amount recorded as a reduction to net sales and
assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimate by developing an expectation of the
amount, based on historical promotional expenditure amounts recorded as a percentage of
sales, and compared our expectation to the recorded promotional expenditure amount.
●We performed inquiries with the Company’s sales and marketing personnel to corroborate
our understanding of new and existing promotional programs that may alter the relationship
between gross sales and promotional allowances, as such programs are considered by
management when estimating future promotional claims.

actual promotional allowances subsequently paid to the original estimates of management.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
1.          ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization – Monster Beverage Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of
Delaware. The Company is a holding company and has no operating business except through its
consolidated subsidiaries.
Nature of Operations – The Company develops, markets, sells and distributes energy drink
beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names:
Monster Energy®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Rehab®, Monster MAXX®, Java Monster®,
Muscle Monster®, Espresso Monster®, Caffé Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster
Hydro®, Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Predator®, Reign Total Body FuelTM, Reign InfernoTM
Thermogenic Fuel, Monster Dragon Tea®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra
Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, BPM®, BU®, Gladiator®, Samurai® and
Live+®.
Basis of Presentation – The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Principles of Consolidation – The Company consolidates all entities that it controls by ownership
of a majority voting interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business
Combinations”.  FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the
acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure
goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at
their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.
Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer
than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-
acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure
certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a
business combination.
Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the
year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured
limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to
incur any losses in the future.
Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-
maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are
those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading
securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not
included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive
loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
81participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (See Note 5).

MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
Under FASB ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the
present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the
difference being defined as the “Credit Loss”) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s
amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of
the security’s amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings
is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be
required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining
difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of
applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-
than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes
market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the
industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on the
guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the
length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the
financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events
which may influence the operations of the issuer and the Company’s intent and ability to retain the
investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.
Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable
based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is
estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company
believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts,
bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of
past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.  In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its
consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional
allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and
related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis.
Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net
realizable value).
Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation of furniture
and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on
their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms
of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance
costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are
capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any
resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.
Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition
exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects.
Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value,
the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step
requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A
potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The
second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the
difference between the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value
82

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
83of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill
over its implied fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no
impairments recorded.
Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the
Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Dragon
Tea®, Unleash the Beast!®, Monster Rehab®, Monster MAXX®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®,
Espresso Monster®, Caffé Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Hydro®, Monster
HydroSport Super Fuel®, Caffé Monster®, Reign Total Body FuelTM, Reign InfernoTM, Predator®,
NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized),
Relentless®, BPM®, BU®, Gladiator® and Samurai® trademarks, all used in connection with the
manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns a number of other trademarks,
flavors and formulas in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In
accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are
measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The
Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their
estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The
Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments recorded.
Leases – See Note 3.
Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived
assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable.  If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate
of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is
estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
management’s estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is
inherently subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected
future conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairment
indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains
or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany
transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the
foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company entered into forward currency
exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a
portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-
functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts
outstanding as of December 31, 2019 have terms of three months or less. The Company does not enter
into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.

The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions
under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency exchange
contracts are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely
offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. For the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, aggregate foreign currency transaction losses, including the gains or
losses on forward currency exchange contracts, amounted to $4.1 million, $4.0 million and $3.3 million,
respectively, and have been recorded in other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income.
Revenue Recognition – See Note 2.
Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases,
the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-
bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the
manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition, the
Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and payroll costs that
relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials
account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers,
flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.
Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses
to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for
advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale
materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses.
 Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees
including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors,
depreciation and other general and administrative costs.
Freight-Out Costs – For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, freight-out costs
amounted to $122.5 million, $128.5 million and $91.9 million, respectively, and have been recorded in
operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Advertising and Promotional Expenses – The Company accounts for advertising production costs
by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. A significant amount
of the Company’s promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement and sponsorship
contracts. Accounting for endorsement and sponsorship payments is based upon specific contract
provisions. Generally, endorsement and sponsorship payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over
the term of the contract after giving recognition to the periodic performance compliance provisions of the
contracts. Advertising and promotional expenses, including, but not limited to, production costs
amounted to $391.6 million, $353.9 million and $324.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. Advertising and promotional expenses are included in operating expenses in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set
forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax
rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation
allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future
taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines
that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance
would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.

85The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to
examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available
at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax
benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially
be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will
be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the
provisions of FASB ASC 718.  The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options
based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options
based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for
performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-
employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-
based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the
closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the
Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a
liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. See Note 15.
Net Income Per Common Share – In accordance with FASB ASC 260, net income per common
share, on a basic and diluted basis, is presented for all periods.  Basic net income per share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of common
equivalent shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury share
repurchases at average market prices, as applicable.
Concentration of Risk – Certain of the Company’s products utilize components (raw materials
and/or co-packing services) from a limited number of sources. A disruption in the supply of such
components could significantly affect the Company’s revenues from those products, as alternative
sources of such components may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or within a reasonably
short time period. The Company continues to endeavor to secure the availability of alternative sources for
such components and minimize the risk of any disruption in production.
The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”), through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “TCCC
Subsidiaries”), accounted for approximately 2%, 3% and 18% of the Company’s net sales for the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As part of TCCC’s North America Refranchising
initiative (the “North America Refranchising”), the territories of certain TCCC Subsidiaries have been
transitioned to certain independent/non wholly-owned TCCC bottlers/distributors. Accordingly, the
Company’s percentage of net sales classified as sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries decreased for the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 13% of the Company’s net sales for
the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 6% of the
Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Coca-Cola European Partners accounted for approximately 10%, 10% and 9% of the Company’s
net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Credit Risk – The Company sells its products nationally and internationally, primarily to bottlers
and full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass
merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce
retailers and the military. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, and
historically, such losses have been within management’s expectations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying value of the Company’s financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments.
Use of Estimates – The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12,
“Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”, as part of its simplification initiative to reduce the cost
and complexity in accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions related to the
approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period
and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019-12 also amends
other aspects of the guidance to help simplify and promote consistent application of GAAP. The guidance
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2019-12 on its financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles–Goodwill and Other–Internal–
Use Software (Topic 350): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud
Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.” ASU No. 2018-15 aligns the requirements for
capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract, with the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
ASU No. 2018-15 was effective for the Company on a prospective or retrospective basis beginning on
January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation–Retirement Benefits–
Defined Benefit Plans–General (Topic 715): Disclosure Framework–Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” ASU No. 2018-14 removes certain disclosures that are not
considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and requires certain additional
disclosures. ASU No. 2018-14 was effective for the Company on a retrospective basis beginning in the
year ending December 31, 2020. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-14 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):
Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” ASU No.
2018-13 removes certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifies existing
disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty and adds new disclosure requirements. ASU
No. 2018-13 disclosure requirements include disclosing the
86
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for
recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and
weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.
ASU No. 2018-13 was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020. Certain disclosures in
the new guidance will need to be applied on a retrospective basis and others on a prospective basis. The
adoption of ASU No. 2018-13 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles and Other (Topic 350):
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the
implied fair value of goodwill, but rather requires an entity to record an impairment charge based on the
excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or
interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of
ASU No. 2017-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations and liquidity.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. The accounting standard changes the
methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing when such losses are
recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02 (ASU No. 2018-02), “Income Statement -
Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)”, which amended the previous guidance to allow for
certain tax effects “stranded” in accumulated other comprehensive income, which are impacted by the
Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, to be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income into retained earnings. This amendment pertains only to those items impacted by
the new tax law and does not apply to any future tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive
income. This standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and allowed for
early adoption. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 did not have an impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. ASU No. 2016-02
requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as
operating leases under previous guidance. The accounting for finance leases (capital leases) was
substantially unchanged. The original guidance required application on a modified retrospective basis
with adjustments to the earliest comparative period presented. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-11, “Targeted Improvements to ASC 842,” which included an option to not restate comparative
periods in transition and elect to use the effective date of ASU No. 2016-02 as the date of initial
application, which the Company elected. As a result, the consolidated balance sheet prior to January 1,
2019 was not restated, and continues to be reported under previous guidance that did not require the
recognition of operating lease liabilities and corresponding lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
With the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded operating lease right-
of-use assets of $26.3 million and operating lease liabilities of $22.6 million. The adoption of ASU No.
2016-02 had an immaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of income and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company elected the
package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which
allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification, not reassess prior conclusions
related to expired or existing contracts that

are or that contain leases, and not reassess the accounting for initial direct costs. Additional information
and disclosures required by ASU No. 2016-02 are contained in Note 3.
2.          REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with
Consumers” for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017,
revenues were accounted for under prior accounting guidance, ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition.”
Commissions paid to TCCC based on sales to certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors who are (i)
TCCC Subsidiaries, (ii) accounted for under the equity method by TCCC (the “TCCC Related Parties”)
and (iii) those not included in (i) or (ii) (the “TCCC Independent Bottlers”) are accounted for as follows:

The Company has three operating and reportable segments; (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment
(“Monster Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks
and Reign Total Body FuelTM high performance energy drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic
Brands”), which is primarily comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC in 2015
as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, and (iii) Other segment (“Other”), which is
comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, to independent third-party customers.
The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling
ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In
some cases, the Company sells directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores,
mass merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce
retailers and the military.
The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
by such bottlers to other bottlers and full service distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains,
wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores,
value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the Strategic Brands segment
generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and
full service beverage distributors.
The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance
obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the
Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying
contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate
function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products
passes to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or
transferred the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms
are short-term
88

in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The
Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2019 and
December 31, 2018.
The Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are
imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers.
Distribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing
expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.
Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales,
primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including,
but not limited to the following:
●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by
retailers;
●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their
promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other
fees for both new and existing products;
●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to
retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;
●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given
directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers;
●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or
exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;
●discounted or free products;
●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made
directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’
sales territories; and
●commissions paid to TCCC based on the Company’s sales to the TCCC Subsidiaries
and/or to the TCCC Related Parties.
The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are
executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally
provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, typically
ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated
based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at
the time of initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on
agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require
management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail
customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for
promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings
in the period such differences are determined.
Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with
certain distributors relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are
accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements,
generally over 20 years.
The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-
party sales of non-beverage products bearing the Company’s trademarks including, but not limited to,
clothing, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.

913.          LEASES
The Company leases identified assets comprising real estate and equipment.  Real estate leases
consist primarily of office and warehouse space and equipment leases consist of vehicles and warehouse
equipment. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a
lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct
identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from
the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of
the asset. At inception of a lease, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease
and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease
payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.
Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC 842.
The Company’s operating leases are comprised of real estate and warehouse equipment, and the
Company’s finance leases are comprised of vehicles.
Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases generally do
not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate
of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date.
ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that
option.
Certain of the Company’s real estate leases contain variable lease payments, including payments
based on an index or rate. Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are initially measured using
the index or rate in effect at the lease commencement date. Additional payments based on the change in
an index or rate, or payments based on a change in the Company’s portion of real estate taxes and
insurance, are recorded as a period expense when incurred.
Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.
Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis
over the asset’s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement
of income. Interest expense on finance leases is calculated using the amortized cost basis and is included
in other income, net in the consolidated statement of income.
The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to 14 years, some of
which include options to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which include options to
terminate the leases within one year.  The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease
liabilities for short-term operating leases that have a term of 12 months or less.

During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, realized gains or losses recognized
on the sale of investments were not significant.
The Company’s investments at December 31, 2019 and 2018 in commercial paper, certificates of
deposit, municipal securities, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries and/or variable rate
demand notes (“VRDNs”) carried investment grade credit ratings. VRDNs are floating rate municipal
bonds with embedded put options that allow the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued
interest. All of the put options are secured by a pledged liquidity source.

5.          FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
FASB ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded
disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The three levels of inputs
required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value are summarized below.
●Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or
liabilities.
●Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
FASB ASC 820 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when
measuring fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever
possible.

All of the Company’s short-term and long-term investments are classified within Level 1 or
Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The Company’s valuation of its Level 1 investments, which
include money market funds, is based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical securities.
The Company’s valuation of its Level 2 investments, which include municipal securities, commercial
paper, U.S. treasuries, certificates of deposit, VRDNs and U.S. government agency securities, is based on
other observable inputs, specifically a market approach which utilizes valuation models, pricing

97systems, mathematical tools and other relevant information for the same or similar securities. The
Company’s valuation of its Level 2 foreign currency exchange contracts is based on quoted market prices
of the same or similar instruments, adjusted for counterparty risk. There were no transfers between Level
1 and Level 2 measurements during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and there were no
changes in the Company’s valuation techniques.
6.          DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks related primarily to its foreign
business operations. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company entered
into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to
specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated
subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange
contracts entered into by the Company that were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 have terms of
three months or less. The Company does not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for
speculation or trading purposes.
The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions
under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency exchange
contracts are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely
offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item.

10.          DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS
In accordance with FASB ASC No. 420 “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations”, the Company
expenses distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination
occurs.  As a result, the Company incurred termination costs of $11.3 million, $26.6 million and $35.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Such termination costs have
been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017.
In the normal course of business, amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution
agreements entered into with certain distributors,  relating to the costs associated with terminating
agreements with the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and are
recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally
20 years. Revenue recognized was $25.0 million, $21.9 million and $22.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
11.        DEBT
The Company entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a

$10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2020.
Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus 1.00% to
1.50%, or London Interbank Offered Rates plus an additional percentage of 1.25% to 1.75%, depending
upon certain financial ratios maintained by the Company. The Company had no outstanding borrowings
on this line of credit at December 31, 2019. Under this revolving line of credit, the Company may also
issue standby Letters of Credit with an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 million.  The fee on the standby
Letters of Credit ranges from 1.00% to 1.50% depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by the
Company.  The Company had no outstanding standby Letters of Credit at December 31, 2019.
In December 2016, the Company entered into a credit facility with HSBC Bank (China)
Company Limited, Shanghai Branch consisting of a non-collateralized working capital line of credit. In
February 2018, the working capital line limit was increased to $15.0 million. At December 31, 2019, the
interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit was 5.5%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company
had no amounts outstanding on this line of credit.
12.        COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
Contractual obligations – The Company has the following contractual obligations related
primarily to sponsorships and other commitments as of December 31, 2019:
Year Ending December 31:     
2020 $121,675
2021  43,575
2022  13,146
2023  3,500
2024  —
2025 and thereafter  —
$181,896
Purchase Commitments – The Company has purchase commitments aggregating approximately
$86.7 million at December 31, 2019, which represent commitments made by the Company and its
subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the production of its products. These obligations
vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year.
The Company purchases various raw material items, including, but not limited to, flavors,
ingredients, supplement ingredients, containers, milk, glucose, sucralose, cream and protein, from a
limited number of suppliers.  An interruption in supply from any of such resources could result in the
Company’s inability to produce certain products for limited or possibly extended periods of time. The
aggregate value of purchases from suppliers of such limited resources described above for the years
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $335.3 million, $289.6 million and $273.6 million,
respectively.
Guarantees – The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that
contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third-party claims. These contracts
primarily relate to: (i) certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees under
which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their
employment relationship, (ii) certain distribution or purchase agreements under which the Company may
have to indemnify the Company’s customers from any claim, liability or loss arising out of any actual or
alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the consumption or purchase of the Company’s
products or the use of Company trademarks, and (iii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company
may be required to indemnify property owners for liabilities and other claims arising from the Company’s
use of the applicable premises. The terms of such obligations vary and typically, a maximum obligation is
not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate to cover
any resulting liabilities or claims.
Litigation – The Company is currently a defendant in a number of personal injury lawsuits,
claiming that the death or other serious injury of the plaintiffs was caused by consumption of Monster
Energy® brand energy drinks. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege strict product liability, negligence,
fraudulent concealment, breach of implied warranties and wrongful death. The Company believes that
each complaint is without merit and plans a vigorous defense. The Company also believes that any
damages, if awarded, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.
Furthermore, from time to time in the normal course of business, the Company is named in other
litigation, including consumer class actions, intellectual property litigation and claims from prior
distributors. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation, based on the
facts known to the Company, management believes that such litigation in aggregate will likely not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

On November 6, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase
program for the purchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the
“November 2019 Repurchase Plan”). No shares were purchased during the year ended December 31,
2019 under the November 2019 Repurchase Plan. As of February 28, 2020, $500.0 million remained
available for repurchase under the November 2019 Repurchase Plan.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, 1.4 million shares of common stock were purchased
from employees in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding taxes due for a total
amount of $84.5 million. While such purchases are considered common stock repurchases, they are not
counted as purchases against the Company's authorized share repurchase programs. Such shares are
included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2019.
15.        STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has two stock-based compensation plans under which shares were available for
grant at December 31, 2019: the Monster Beverage Corporation 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan”), including
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
the Monster Beverage Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”) as a sub plan
thereunder, and the Monster Beverage Corporation 2017 Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors (the “2017 Directors Plan”), including the Monster Beverage Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors as a sub plan thereunder.
The 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan permits the granting of options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards and other stock-based awards up to an
aggregate of 43,500,000 shares of the common stock of the Company to employees or consultants of the
Company and its subsidiaries. Shares authorized under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan are reduced by
2.16 shares for each share granted or issued with respect to a Full Value Award (as defined in the 2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan). A Full Value Award is an award other than an incentive stock option, a non-
qualified stock option, or a stock appreciation right, which is settled by the issuance of shares. Options
granted under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan may be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or non-qualified stock options. The Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has sole and exclusive authority to grant stock
awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new hires who are subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors
(the “Executive Committee”) each independently has the authority to grant stock awards to new hires
who are not Section 16 employees. Awards granted by the Executive Committee are not subject to
approval or ratification by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. Options granted
under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest over a five-year period from the grant date and are
generally exercisable up to 10 years after the grant date. As of December 31, 2019, 24,555,792 shares of
the Company’s common stock have been granted, net of cancellations, and 14,169,367 shares (as adjusted
for Full Value Awards) of the Company’s common stock remain available for grant under the 2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan.
In 2016, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan (as a sub plan to the 2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan), pursuant to which eligible employees may elect to defer cash and/or equity
based compensation and to receive the deferred amounts, together with an investment return (positive or
negative), either at a pre-determined time in the future or upon termination of their employment with the
Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates that are participating employers under the Deferred
Compensation Plan, as provided under the Deferred Compensation Plan and in relevant deferral
elections. Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan are unfunded and unsecured. As of December
31, 2019, deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan are solely comprised of cash compensation
and equity compensation and are not material in the aggregate.
In 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Directors Plan, a successor plan to the 2009 Monster
Beverage Corporation Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2017 Directors Plan
permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares or restricted stock units,
deferred awards, dividend equivalents, and other share based-awards up to an aggregate of 1,250,000
shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee directors of the Company.
Each calendar year, a non-employee director will receive an annual retainer and annual equity
award, as provided for in the 2017 Directors Plan, which may be modified from time to time.  Currently,
with respect to equity awards, each non-employee director receives an award of restricted stock units at
each annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders or promptly thereafter. A non-employee director’s
annual award of restricted stock units will generally vest on the earliest to occur of: (a) the last business
day immediately preceding the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders in the calendar year
following the calendar year in which the grant date occurs, (b) a Change of Control (as defined in the
2017 Directors Plan), (c) the non-employee director’s death, or (d) the date of the non-employee
director’s separation from service due to disability, so long as the non-employee director remains a non-
employee director through such date. The Board of Directors may in its discretion award non-employee
directors stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other share-
104

MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
based awards in lieu of or in addition to restricted stock units.  The Board of Directors may amend or
terminate the 2017 Directors Plan at any time, subject to certain limitations set forth in the 2017 Directors
Plan. As of December 31, 2019, 68,774 shares of the Company’s common stock had been granted under
the 2017 Directors Plan, and 1,181,226 shares of the Company’s common stock remain available for
grant.
In 2017, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (as
a sub plan to the 2017 Directors Plan), pursuant to which the Board of Directors may permit non-
employee directors to elect, at such times and in accordance with rules and procedures (or sub-plan)
adopted by the Board of Directors (which are intended to comply with Code Section 409A, as
applicable), to receive all or any portion of such non-employee director’s compensation, whether payable
in cash or in equity, on a deferred basis. Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-
Employee Directors are unfunded and unsecured. As of December 31, 2019, deferrals under the Deferred
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors are solely comprised of cash compensation and equity
compensation and are not material in the aggregate. The 2017 Directors Plan was adopted to effectuate
any such deferrals.  The 2017 Directors Plan is administered by the Board of Directors.  Each award
granted under the 2017 Directors Plan will be evidenced by a written agreement and will contain the
terms and conditions that the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
Under the 2017 Directors Plan, the Board of Directors requires each non-employee director to
satisfy the share ownership guidelines set forth below, as may be amended by the Board of Directors
from time to time. The current share ownership guidelines provide that non-employee directors of the
Company must:
●Hold at least 9,000 shares of Company common stock. For this purpose, deferred shares or
deferred restricted stock units will be deemed held, to the extent vested.
●The minimum stock ownership level must be achieved by each non-employee director by the
third (3rd) anniversary of such non-employee director’s initial appointment to the Board of
Directors.
●Once achieved, ownership of the guideline amount should be maintained for so long as the
non-employee director retains his or her seat on the Board of Directors.
●There may be rare instances where these guidelines would place a hardship on a non-
employee director. In these cases or in similar circumstances, the Board of Directors will
make the final decision as to developing an alternative stock ownership guideline for a non-
employee director that reflects the intention of these guidelines and his or her personal
circumstances.
The Company recorded $63.4 million, $57.1 million and $52.3 million of compensation expense
relating to stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units during the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The tax benefit for tax deductions from non-qualified stock option exercises, disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options and vesting of restricted stock units for the years ended December
31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $25.9 million, $8.5 million and $96.7 million, respectively.
Stock Options
Under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans, all stock options granted through
December 31, 2019 were granted at prices based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on
the date of grant. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the
estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company records
105
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
106compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as
of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the
stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The
Company uses historical data to determine the exercise behavior, volatility and forfeiture rate of the
options.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options
granted during:
    2019    2018    2017 
Dividend yield 0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  
Expected volatility 30.2%  34.7%  36.5%  
Risk-free interest rate 2.37%  2.81%  2.11%  
Expected term 6.0 Years 6.0 Years 6.1 Years
Expected Volatility: The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of
the expected volatility. Historical volatility is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a
period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option.
Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero coupon yield
curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.
Expected Term: The Company’s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the
Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on expected time to
post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses historical exercise patterns of
previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise
patterns.

At December 31, 2019, there was $80.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense
related to non-vested options granted to employees under the Company’s share-based payment plans.
That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.
Restricted Stock Units
Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the
option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued
at each balance sheet date.

10916.        INCOME TAXES
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Reform Act.
The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax
rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax
rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant
does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in
reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. A
company may select between one of three scenarios to determine a reasonable estimate for certain
income tax effects arising from the Tax Reform Act. Those scenarios are (i) a final estimate which
effectively closes the measurement window; (ii) a reasonable estimate leaving the measurement window
open for future revisions; and (iii) no estimate as the law is still being analyzed. The Company was able
to provide a reasonable estimate for the revaluation of deferred taxes and the effects of the toll charge on
undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits (“E&P”). As a result of the reduction in the U.S.
corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its net
deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017, resulting in a provisional $39.8 million charge included in the
provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Reform Act also provided for
a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 E&P through the year ended December 31, 2017.
As a result, the Company recognized a provisional $2.1 million charge in the provision for income taxes
for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to such deemed mandatory repatriation. The Company
completed its analysis of the Tax Reform Act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimate to
the final amounts in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. The measurement window
begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained,
prepared and analyzed the information needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under
ASC 740. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made an adjustment to the provisional
amount and recognized an additional $1.8 million provision for income tax related to the deemed
mandatory repatriation.
The Company has not made additional measurement window adjustments to these items during
the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Company evaluated the various provisions of the Tax Reform Act, including, the global
intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and the foreign derived intangible income provisions. The
Company will treat any U.S. tax on foreign earnings under GILTI as a current period expense when
incurred.
The Company currently considers the earnings of its foreign entities (excluding Japan) to be
permanently reinvested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation
will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been
recorded for the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries excluding Japan. Deferred
income taxes have not been recorded for Japan, as any federal, state, or foreign withholding taxes
associated with the repatriation of those earnings would be immaterial.

During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company established full
valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, resulting from cumulative net operating losses
incurred by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company. The effect of the valuation allowances and the
subsequent related impact on the Company’s overall tax rate was to increase the Company’s provision for
income taxes by $3.7 million, $4.0 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $112.4 million. Of this amount, $77.5 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The
remaining $34.8 million of net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
the provision for income taxes in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31,
2019, the Company had accrued approximately $0.4 million in interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions it would not have
a significant impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.
It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefit change within the next 12 months will
not be significant.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax in multiple state and
foreign jurisdictions.

19.        SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has three operating and reportable segments; (i) Monster Energy® Drinks
segment, which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks and Reign Total Body
FuelTM high performance energy drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment, which is comprised primarily of
the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC in 2015 as well as the Company’s affordable energy
brands, and (iii) Other segment, which is comprised of the AFF Third-Party Products.  
The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by
selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In
some cases, the Company sells directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores,
mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and
the military.
The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
by such bottlers to other bottlers, full service distributors or retailers, including, retail grocery and
specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice
customers, drug stores, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the
Company’s Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink
packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors.
