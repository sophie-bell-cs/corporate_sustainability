Industry Overview
The “alternative” beverage category combines non-carbonated, ready-to-drink iced teas,
lemonades, juice cocktails, single-serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks,
energy drinks, sports drinks and single-serve still waters (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new
age” beverages, including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling
beverages. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2021 for the
“alternative” beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $67.0 billion, representing an
increase of approximately 11.4% over estimated domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2020 of approximately
$60.1 billion.
Reportable Segments
We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment (“Monster
Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel®
high performance energy drinks and True North® Pure Energy Seltzers, (ii) Strategic Brands segment
(“Strategic Brands”), which is comprised primarily of the various energy drink brands acquired from The
Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”) in 2015 as well as our affordable energy brands, and (iii) Other segment
(“Other”), which is comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors LLC (“AFF”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party
Products”).
Table of Contents
4Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some
cases, we sell directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers,
convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the
military.
Our Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates”
and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the
concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink
packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers, full
service distributors or retailers, including, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores,
mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-commerce
retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues
by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors.
Generally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues,
but lower per case gross profit margin percentages than the Strategic Brands segment.
For certain risks with respect to our energy drinks see “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” below.
Corporate History
In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices in
Los Angeles, California. In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a
demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc. (“HFI”).
HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural Soda® brand sodas. In 1990,
California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain assets of
HFI, including the right to market the Hansen’s® brand name. In 1992, Hansen Natural Corporation
acquired the Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our ownership, the
Hansen’s® beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages within the
growing “alternative” beverage category including, in particular, energy drinks. In 2012, we changed our
name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015, we acquired various
energy brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business. In 2016, we completed our
acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner AFF.
CANarchy Acquisition
On February 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC
(“CANarchy”), a craft beer and hard seltzer company, for $330.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments.
The transaction allows us to enter the alcohol beverage sector and brings the Cigar City family of brands
including Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA, the Oskar Blues family of brands including Dale’s Pale Ale
and Wild Basin Hard Seltzers, the Deep Ellum family of brands including Dallas Blonde and Deep Ellum
IPA, the Perrin Brewing family of brands including Black Ale, the Squatters family of brands including
Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA and the Wasatch family of brands including Apricot Hefeweizen to
our beverage portfolio. The transaction does not include CANarchy’s stand-alone restaurants. Our
organizational structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged. CANarchy will
function independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team.
2021 Product Introductions
During 2021, we continued to expand our existing energy drink portfolio by adding additional
products to our portfolio in a number of countries and further developed our distribution markets. During
2021, we sold the following new products to our customers:

8Other Products
We continue to evaluate and, where considered appropriate, introduce additional products, flavors
and types of beverages to complement our existing product lines. We may also evaluate, and where
considered appropriate, introduce additional types of consumer products we consider to be complementary
to our existing products and/or to which our brand names are able to add value.
The Company also sells and/or enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated
with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing the Company’s trademarks including, but not
limited to, clothing, backpacks, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.
Products – Packaging
Our products are packaged in a variety of different package types and sizes including, but not
limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends
as well as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles.
Manufacture and Distribution
AFF develops and manufactures the primary flavors for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment.
We do not operate our own manufacturing facilities for finished goods, but instead outsource the
manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and contract packers.
We purchase flavor ingredients, flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, supplement ingredients,
cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our beverage products from ingredient
suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain
common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the
product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including
supplement ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved
containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/packer may
also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
For our Strategic Brands segment, we primarily purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases from
ingredient suppliers, which are then sold to certain of our various third-party bottlers/distributors. The
third-party bottlers/distributors are responsible for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products,
including the procurement of all other required ingredients and packaging materials. For certain limited
products in the Strategic Brands segment, we may purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices,
supplement ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our Strategic
Brand products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers.
In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-
packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other
ingredients (including supplement ingredients), for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products
into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the
bottler/co-packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
Co-Packing Arrangements
All of our finished goods are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers situated
throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our co-packaging
arrangements vary in terms and do not generally obligate us to procure minimum quantities of products
within specified periods.
Table of Contents
9In some instances, subject to agreement, certain equipment may be purchased exclusively by us
and/or jointly with our co-packers, and installed at their facilities to enable them to produce certain of our
products. In certain cases, such equipment remains our property and is required to be returned to us upon
termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers, unless we are reimbursed by the co-packer
at the then book value or via a per-case credit over a pre-determined number of cases that are produced at
the facilities concerned.
For our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, we are generally responsible for arranging for the
purchase and delivery to our third-party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage
products are packaged.
Our products are packaged in a number of locations, both domestically and internationally. As
distribution volumes increase in both our domestic and international markets, we will continue to source
additional packing arrangements.
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and
may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially
underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials
including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans
with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, caps, labels, flavor ingredients, flavors, juice concentrates,
coffee, tea, supplement ingredients, other ingredients and certain sweeteners, and/or procure adequate
packing arrangements and/or obtain adequate or timely shipment of our products, we might not be able to
satisfy demand on a short-term basis. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).
For most of our products there are limited co-packing facilities in our domestic and international
markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment to package our products. We believe a short
disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenues; however, as alternative co-
packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate long-term capacity may not be
available for such products, either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period, if at all, a lengthy disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly
affect our revenues.
We continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities around the world
(including in Africa, Asia, Australia, Central and South America, China, Europe, India, Mexico, the Middle
East and the United States) with adequate capacity and capability for the production of our various
products to minimize transportation costs and transportation-related damages as well as to mitigate the risk
of a disruption in production and/or importation.
Distribution Agreements
During 2021, we continued to expand distribution of our products in both our domestic and
international markets.
Distribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Net sales outside the United States
were $2.04 billion, $1.51 billion and $1.33 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.
Table of Contents
10Monster Energy® Distribution Agreements
We have entered into agreements with various bottlers/distributors providing for the distribution of
our products during initial terms of up to twenty years, which may be renewed thereafter for additional
terms ranging from one to five years, subject to certain terms and conditions which may vary depending on
the form of the agreement. Such agreements remain in effect for their then-current term as long as our
products are being distributed, but are subject to specified termination rights held by each party, which may
include by way of example, and depending on the form of agreement, termination upon: mutual agreement;
material breach of the agreement by, or an insolvency of, either party; deadlock; change of control; changes
in legal or regulatory conditions and termination of certain related agreements. Additionally, we are entitled
to terminate certain distribution agreements at any time without cause upon payment of a termination fee,
including a limited number of distribution agreements with TCCC network bottlers that were entered into
prior to 2015.
Certain of our material distribution arrangements for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, as
amended from time to time, are described below:
(a)Amended and Restated Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we
have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in
Canada and the United States in which bottlers from TCCC’s network of wholly or partially-owned
and independent bottlers (the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and sell, or
continue to distribute and sell, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.
(b)Amended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant
to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries, or territories within
countries, in which we wish to appoint TCCC network bottlers to distribute and sell our Monster
Energy® brand energy drinks, subject to TCCC’s approval. In February 2020, the Amended and
Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC was renewed for an
additional five-year term.
(c)Additionally, we have entered into distribution agreements for certain of our Monster Energy®
products with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally.
All distribution territories in the United States, and substantially all distribution territories
internationally have been transitioned to TCCC network bottlers/distributors.
Strategic Brands Distribution Agreements
We have entered into distribution coordination agreements with TCCC pursuant to which we have
designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in which TCCC
network bottlers will distribute our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
We have entered into agreements with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States
and internationally, providing for the distribution and sale of our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum cans,
aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, caps,
as well as flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, coffee, tea,
supplement ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations. As a
consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and
package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in food service on-
premise consumption. This shift has resulted in increased industry demand for aluminum cans, leading to
aluminum cans being in short supply.
Table of Contents
11AFF is the primary flavor supplier for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. We also
purchase flavors from other suppliers as well as juices, supplement ingredients, glucose, sugar, sucralose,
other sweeteners and other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.
For our Strategic Brands energy drinks, we purchase flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases
from flavor suppliers including TCCC in the United States and abroad, and may purchase certain other
ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.
With regard to our Java Monster®, Espresso Monster® and Muscle Monster® product lines, the
dairy, protein and retort co-packing industries are subject to shortages and increased demand from time to
time, which may result in production disruption and/or higher prices.
For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our
Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor
suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the
list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of
our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from
alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers generally do not make such flavors
and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers.
We have identified alternative suppliers for many of the ingredients contained in many of our
beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavor ingredients,flavors, fruits and fruit juices,
coffee, tea, dairy-based products, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to
time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our
products.
We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavor ingredients,
flavors and concentrates purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as to negotiate arrangements with
our existing suppliers, which would enable us to obtain access to certain of such concentrates or flavor
formulas under certain circumstances. We have been partially successful in these endeavors. Additionally,
in a limited number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and
licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers, manufacturers and/or
distributors.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation, unanticipated increases in demand, labor
shortages and supply chain disruptions, we experienced shortages of certain raw materials, such as
aluminum cans and ingredients, and increased import and operating costs in 2021 and will likely continue
to experience such costs in fiscal year 2022. See “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Distribution and Supply Chain” for more information
on such shortages and how we have, and will continue to, remediate such challenges in our supply chain.
Competition
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing,
packaging, development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies. Our
products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies, many
of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.
Table of Contents
12Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include brand and product image,
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and
unique cutting edge products, ingredients, attractive and different packaging, brand exposure and marketing
as well as pricing. We also rely on our bottlers and full service beverage distributors to allocate more
attention to our products than those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and secure
adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the “alternative”, energy, coffee and
“functional” beverage categories could cause our products to maintain or to lose market share or we could
experience price erosion, which could materially impact our business and results of operations.
We have experienced and continue to experience competition from new entrants in the energy
drink and energy shot categories. A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, coffees,
juice cocktails, enhanced waters and sports drinks in various larger volume packages in glass and plastic
bottles (including BODYARMOR, Vitamin Water, CORE, Arizona, Ocean Spray, Powerade, Gatorade Bolt
24 and Starbucks) and 12- and 16-ounce cans (such as Mountain Dew Kickstart and Game Fuel), have
added supplement ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as “functional” or
energy beverages or as having “functional” benefits. We believe that many of those products contain lower
levels of supplement ingredients, principally deliver refreshment and are positioned differently from our
energy or “functional” drinks.
We are also subject to increasing levels of regulatory issues including in relation to the registration
and/or taxation of our products in certain new international markets, which may put us at a competitive
disadvantage. (See “Government Regulation” below for additional information).
We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum marketing, sales efforts and
attention from our multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors, many of which have a principal
affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in
many cases with products of much larger and in some cases better financed competitors, including the
products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc.
(“PepsiCo”), Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (“KDP”) and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete with companies that
are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private-label brands such as
those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.
Domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, MTN Dew Amp, MTN
Dew Kickstart, MTN Dew GameFuel and MTN Dew Energy, G Fuel, Venom, VPX Redline, 5-Hour
Energy Shots, MiO Energy, VPX Bang, V8 + Energy, Uptime, hi*ball, CELSIUS, C4, Alani Nu, 3D
Energy, ZOA Energy, Rowdy Energy, GHOST Energy, Starbucks BAYA energy and many other brands.
In 2020, PepsiCo acquired Rockstar and entered into an agreement with VPX to distribute VPX
Bang products in the United States. PepsiCo also markets and/or distributes additional products in that
market segment such as Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew, MTN Dew Energy, MTN Dew Kickstart and MTN
Dew Game Fuel.
Internationally, our energy drinks compete with Red Bull (including non-carbonated Red Bull in
China and Asia), Rockstar, V-Energy, Lucozade, and numerous local and private-label brands that usually
differ from country to country, such as HELL, Amper, Shock, Tiger, Fearless, Boost, TNT, Shark, Dragon,
Score, Sting, Hot 6, Suntory ZONE, Battery, Bullit, Flash Up, Black, Non-Stop, Bomba, Semtex, Vive 100,
Dark Dog, Speed, Guarana, M-150, Lipovitan, Bacchus, Volt, Bolt, Mr. Big, Boom, Raptor, Amp, Fusion,
Hi-Tiger, Eastroc Super Drink, Carabao, Power Horse, XL, Crazy Tiger, Effect, Missile, Nocco, Adrenaline
Rush, Real Gold, War Horse, BLU, and a host of other international brands.
Our Reign Total Body Fuel® and Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel high performance energy
drinks compete with VPX Bang, Adrenaline Shoc, C4, CELSIUS, NOCCO, Rockstar XDURANCE in the
performance energy category.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand
awareness through image-enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and
other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize
“push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers
and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to
encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions,
price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, sports personality
endorsements, sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes, teams, series, bands, esports, causes and
events. In-store posters, outdoor posters, social media, concerts, print, radio and television advertising
(directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our
brands.
We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our
brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We
review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them
different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned and refreshed from
time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which
we continue to reevaluate from time to time.
Where appropriate, we partner with our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers to assist our marketing
efforts.
We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 21.0% in the
twelve-months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to increased expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements as well as social
and digital marketing. During the comparative twelve-months ended December 31, 2020, we decreased
expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements and decreased expenditures for travel and entertainment,
each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was
less pronounced on our sales and marketing programs in the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021. We
increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 9.2% in the twelve-months
ended December 31, 2021 compared to the twelve-months ended December 31, 2019 (pre COVID-19).

Seasonality
Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar
quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. We believe that the volume of sales in the beverage
industry is affected by weather conditions. However, the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal
than traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the
introduction of new products, the opening of new markets, particularly internationally, where temperature
fluctuations may be more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of
the sales of our finished products and increased or decreased advertising and promotional expenses.

We protect our trademarks by applying for registrations and registering our trademarks with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office and with government agencies in other countries around the
world, particularly where our products are distributed and sold. We assert copyright ownership of the
statements, graphics and content appearing on the packaging of our products and in our marketing

of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.
We also enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or disparaging our
trademarks by opposing registration of conflicting trademarks and initiating litigation as necessary.
Government Regulation
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to
various U.S. federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and
regulations governing workplace health and safety; various environmental statutes; the Safe Drinking
Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“California Proposition 65”); various state and federal laws and
regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages; data privacy and personal data
protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by
the California Privacy Rights Act) and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations
applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of
such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are
also subject to numerous statutes and regulations.
Table of Contents
16We also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations
or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors – Changes in government
regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations” and “Significant changes to or failure to comply with various
environmental laws may expose us to liability and/or cause certain of our facilities to close, relocate or
operate at reduced production levels, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations” below for additional information.
Furthermore, legislation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal,
state, municipal and supranational level in respect of each of the subject areas discussed below. Public
health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated
with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption
of sweetened beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages and we
are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy drinks.
Product Formulation, Labeling and Advertising. Globally, we are subject to a number of
regulations applicable to the formulation, labeling and advertising (including promotional campaigns) of
our products. In California, we are subject to California Proposition 65, a law which requires that a
specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that contains in excess
of threshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or
reproductive toxicity. California Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product
can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a
listed substance that is below that threshold amount, which is determined either by scientific criteria set
forth in applicable regulations or via a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established by the state, or the
substance is naturally occurring, or is subject to another applicable exception. If we are required to add
warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold, it
will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an adverse impact on
sales of our products in those locations or elsewhere.
In addition, in May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) revised regulations
with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products, including a
new requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. These changes went into effect
on January 1, 2020. Further, in December 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture promulgated
regulations requiring that, by January 1, 2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods include a
disclosure that the food is bioengineered. Additionally, these new regulations may impact, reduce and/or
otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by consumers.
Other countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, the member states
of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Mexico, and the People’s Republic of China, are also considering, or
have enacted, new labeling requirements, which may require us to amend our labels and warning
statements. The United Kingdom Government has also suggested that it may review food labeling laws
following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (“Brexit”).
Table of Contents
17Age and Other Restrictions on Energy Drink Products. Proposals to limit or restrict the sale and/or
advertising of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age, and/or restrict the venues in
which energy drinks can be sold, and/or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised and/or enacted in certain U.S.
states, counties, municipalities and/or in certain foreign countries. For example, in the United States, bills
seeking to impose an age restriction on the sale of energy drinks have been introduced in the Connecticut,
Massachusetts, and South Carolina legislatures. Outside of the United States, for example, Latvia,
Lithuania and Turkey prohibit the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18; Canada prohibits
the promotion of energy drinks to children 12 years and under; Latvia and Scotland prohibit the sale of
energy drinks in educational establishments; and Turkey prohibits the sale or advertising of energy drinks
in “collective consumption areas,” such as sports complexes, schools or hospitals. In Mexico, the States of
Tabasco and Oaxaca prohibit the sale of energy drinks to minors and the consumption in schools; Colima
prohibits the sale of energy drinks in private and public schools. Other Latin American countries such as
Chile, Colombia and Brazil have been considering age and other sales restrictions on energy drinks, as are
other countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Romania and Bulgaria.
Excise Taxes on Energy Drinks. Legislation that would impose an excise tax on sweetened
beverages has been proposed in the U.S. Congress, in some state legislatures and by some local
governments, with excise taxes generally ranging between $0.01 and $0.02 per ounce of sweetened
beverage. Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction to pass such a measure, and a general tax of
$0.01 per ounce on certain sweetened drinks, including energy drinks, became effective on January 1,
2015. Other U.S. jurisdictions (including Albany, Oakland and San Francisco, California; Boulder,
Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Seattle, Washington) have passed similar measures, some of
which have been challenged in litigation. The imposition of such taxes on our products would increase the
cost of certain of our products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make certain of our products
less affordable. Excise taxes on sweetened beverages already are in effect in certain foreign countries
where we do business, such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa and Mexico. Poland
recently established a tax on drinks with added sugars, specifically targeting beverages containing caffeine
and taurine. Other countries, including the Dominican Republic, are considering similar measures. In
addition, legislation has been proposed in certain jurisdictions that would specifically impose excise taxes
on energy drinks. For example, Kuwait is considering a proposal that would impose an excise tax on
energy drinks. Such targeted legislation has been passed in other countries. For instance, on January 1,
2020, a reform to a Mexican excise tax went into effect that expanded the definition of an “energy drink”
subject to this tax to include products with any amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a
threshold of 20 milligrams of caffeine per 100 millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and “taurine or
glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other substance that produces similar stimulating effects.”
Hungary has instituted an excise tax to which our products are subject. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates began applying a selective tax of 100% on energy drinks in 2017, Qatar and Oman
began applying the tax in 2019, and there are indications that a similar measure may be enacted in Kuwait.
Limits on Caffeine Content. Legislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that may
be contained in beverages, including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have
prescribed limited caffeine content for beverages. For example, in Canada, the maximum amount of
caffeine cannot exceed 180 mg per single-serving container or per serving (500 ml) in the case of a multi-
serving container. We adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy® products that are sold
in Canada to address these regulations, although the majority of our products were unaffected. In Europe,
examples of caffeine restrictions include the Netherlands where there is a limit of 35mg/100ml, and
Norway introduced, as of January 1, 2020 (subject to transition periods), a limit of 32mg/100ml. Caffeine
limit restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients or in particular product
sectors (such as performance beverages/sport drinks) have also been implemented or proposed in other
jurisdictions, including Turkey, India, Pakistan’s Punjab region, Egypt, Spain and the member states of the
Gulf Cooperation Council. Such restrictions could require reformulations of certain of our products.
However, we may not be able to satisfactorily reformulate our products in all jurisdictions that adopt
similar legislation.
Table of Contents
18Limitations on Container Size. We package our products in a variety of different package types and
sizes including, for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, aluminum cans larger than 16
fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, the Dominican Republic, and
Spain, are considering container size limitations on energy drinks and other beverages which may require
us to change the size of our products sold in these countries. Other countries, like England, have considered
and rejected proposed can size limitations although it is open to such markets to revisit these and other
similar proposals.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
Our facilities and those of our co-packers in the United States are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, the use of water resources
and recycling. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar federal, state, local and supranational
laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Changes in environmental compliance
mandates, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our
financial performance and future growth. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect
such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or
competitive position.
Container Deposits. Various municipalities, states and foreign countries require that a deposit be
charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these
measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been, and
may in the future be, introduced in certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and in certain foreign
countries.
In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such
redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon
the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other
states and countries where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our
customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and
bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
Human Capital Resources

American and other Indigenous tribes and approximately 39% of our U.S. employees are female.
In 2020, we established our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Leadership Advisory Group,
comprised of leaders from across the Company, designed to provide insight on our diversity and inclusion
efforts and to assist in the integration of the EDI program with our overall strategy and business objectives.
We provide training for our employees covering harassment, discrimination and unconscious bias.
Table of Contents
19We support our employees through a variety of training and development programs. We have a
mid-level manager development program, in which participants learn leadership skills, network with peers
and senior executives, and tackle critical initiatives. We also have a leadership development platform in
partnership with a third party, for senior leaders to receive university grade certificates in business strategy
and innovation and complete Food and Beverage Executive courses as well as an electronic learning
platform that focuses on business acumen, professional development and technical capabilities.
We provide compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent while maintaining
alignment with market compensation surveys. We have multiple short-term incentive programs focused on
incentivizing and retaining talent throughout the organization and provide long-term incentive programs to
employees through equity and/or performance cash awards. We currently cover the cost of insurance
premiums including medical, dental, vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment, short and long term
disability, and an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) covering full-time employees and share in the cost
of insurance premiums covering eligible dependents including medical, dental and vision coverage. We
also offer several voluntary benefits to full-time employees, including supplemental life insurance, whole
life insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, flexible spending accounts, travel insurance,
pre-paid legal, healthy rewards programs, identity theft assistance, and retirement savings account(s).
COVID-19 Employee Health Measures and Support. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we
have implemented measures to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and have adapted
such measures based on our close monitoring of the rapidly evolving situation. We have implemented
work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. Where possible, we provide
employees with equipment to facilitate home-based work. For those employees unable to work remotely,
we implemented safety precautions, such as on-site COVID-19 testing, which were developed and adopted
in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. We have also provided
our employees with the following: year-end bonuses for essential, hourly employees; increased employee
communications, including on topics such as mental health and family welfare; weekly and bi-weekly
communication from executive leadership; wellness hotlines and enhanced employee assistance programs;
employee surveys to evaluate employee morale; and resilience training programs to provide employees
with the tools and resources to be resilient in the current climate, to stay healthy, and to engage in self-care.

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial
statements and related notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. If any of the following risks
actually occur or continue to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results
could be materially adversely affected. The risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial
may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.
Risk Factors Summary
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. You should read this summary together
with the more detailed description of each risk contained below.
Operational and Industry Risks
●The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and we expect will continue to impact our business and
operations.
●The Company and TCCC have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the
Company’s future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with
TCCC.
●Provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders or TCCC may prevent changes
in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.
●We rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to
maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to
manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.
●We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors,
our business could suffer.
●We derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy
drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results.
●Criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks
generally, could adversely affect us.
●Increased competition in the beverage industry and changing retail landscape could hurt our
business.
●Our inability to implement our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and
new sectors, such as the alcohol beverage sector, or successfully integrate acquired businesses or
assets could adversely affect our business and financial results.

Operational and Industry Risks
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and we expect will continue to impact our business and operations.
The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health
and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business
operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences
of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by
governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers and
other service providers) and the public at large to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, have and will directly and
indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following:
●The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business. The duration
and severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain
and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information regarding the COVID-19
pandemic, as well as the emergence of new variants, the action taken to limit its spread
and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. As
countries continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and as governments and/or local
authorities impose regulations regarding COVID-19 testing, vaccine mandates and related
workplace restrictions, there remains a risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our
business and supply chain, including our ability to recruit and/or retain our employees as
well as impact our co-packers, bottlers/distributors and/or suppliers.
●Deteriorating economic conditions and continued financial uncertainties in many of our
major markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as inflation, increased and prolonged
unemployment, decreases in per capita income and the level of disposable income,
declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could affect
consumer purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby
reducing demand for our products. In addition, public concern among consumers
regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 may also reduce demand for our products.
Table of Contents
●The closures of, and continued restrictions on, on-premise retailers and other
establishments that sell our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have
adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our sales and results of
operations.
●Our product sampling programs, which are part of our strategy to develop brand
awareness, have been, and will continue to be, disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If
we are unable to successfully adapt to the changing landscape of advertising, marketing,
promotional, sponsorship and endorsement opportunities created by the COVID-19
pandemic, our sales, market share, volume growth and overall financial results could be
negatively affected.
●Our innovation activities, including our ability to introduce new products in certain
markets, have been delayed and/or adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If
such innovation activities are disrupted and we continue to delay the launch of new
products and/or we are unable to secure sufficient distribution levels for such new
products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
●Some of our suppliers, bottlers/distributors and co-packers have experienced, and likely
will continue to experience, plant closures, production slowdowns and disruptions in
operations as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could result in
material disruptions to our operations.
●We have experienced and may continue to experience delays in receiving certain raw
materials as a result of shipping delays due to, among other things, additional safety
requirements imposed by port authorities, closures of, or congestion at ports, reduced
availability of commercial transportation, freight inefficiencies, shortages of shipping
containers, border restrictions and capacity constraints.
●Due to increased demand in at home beverage consumption, aluminum cans remain in
tight supply, which could adversely impact or limit our sales and/or results of operations.
We may also need to commit to minimum purchase volumes in order to secure sufficient
quantities of certain raw materials including aluminum cans, as well as minimum co-
packing volumes, which may lead to claims, costs, or losses if we over-estimate future
demand for our products and do not use such volumes in full.  
●We rely on relationships with third parties for cloud data storage and other information
technology services for certain functions or for services in support of our operations.
These third parties are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19
pandemic, which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their respective commitments
and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon
terms.
●As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental measures,
restrictions, directives and guidance, most of our office-based employees continue to work
remotely. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business
routines while our remote work policy remains in place. If our employees working
remotely do not maintain appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our
technology and operations from information technology-related disruptions, we may face
cybersecurity threats. Employees of our third-party service providers who are working
remotely, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar cybersecurity risks.
●Governmental authorities at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level and in certain
foreign jurisdictions may increase or impose new income taxes, indirect taxes or other
taxes or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations as a means of financing
the costs of stimulus or may take other measures to protect populations and economies
from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in direct and indirect
23
Table of Contents
24tax rates could affect our net income, and increases in consumer taxes could affect our
products’ affordability and reduce our sales.
●We may be required to record significant impairment charges with respect to goodwill or
intangible assets, whose fair values may be negatively affected by the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
●The continued financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause one or more of the
financial institutions we do business with to fail or default in their obligations to us or to
become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, which could cause us to incur significant losses
and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
●Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a
consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in negative publicity and the
Company becoming a party to litigation claims and/or legal proceedings, which could
consume significant financial and managerial resources, result in decreased demand for
our products and injury to our reputation.
●The resumption of normal business operations after the disruptions caused by the COVID-
19 pandemic may be delayed or constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic’s lingering
effects on our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers, contractors, business partners
and/or other service providers.
Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or
in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating
results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others,
could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our
business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition.
The Company and TCCC have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the Company’s future
performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with TCCC.
We have transitioned all third parties’ rights to distribute the Company’s products in the U.S. to
members of TCCC’s distribution network, which largely consists of independent bottlers/distributors. In
addition, except for a handful of countries, TCCC is our preferred distribution partner globally, with
members of TCCC’s network distributing our products internationally, including in Africa, Asia, Canada,
Central and South America, Europe, Mexico and the Middle East. As we progress our international
expansion, we expect TCCC’s distribution network to continue as our preferred distribution partner
globally. As a result, we have reduced our distributor diversification and are now dependent on TCCC’s
domestic and international distribution platforms.
TCCC has a substantial equity investment in the Company. The Company, TCCC and certain
affiliates are parties to various agreements in which TCCC and certain affiliates have agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category in certain territories prior to the termination
of the applicable distribution coordination agreement with TCCC. The Company’s distribution agreements
with TCCC distributors also provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the applicable distributor will not
distribute competitive energy drink products.
While we believe that these agreements incentivize TCCC to take steps to ensure that our products
receive the appropriate attention in the TCCC distribution system, disagreements as to the interpretation of
the provisions in such agreements have arisen and may arise in the future. In addition, TCCC does not
control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their
own business decisions that may not always align with TCCC’s interests.
Table of Contents
25Provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders or TCCC may prevent changes in
control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.
Our organizational documents may limit changes in control. Furthermore, as of February 16, 2022,
Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control
over approximately 10% of our outstanding common stock. As of February 16, 2022, TCCC owned
approximately 19% of our common stock. TCCC has also nominated one director to the Company’s board
of directors. Consequently, Mr. Sacks, Mr. Schlosberg and TCCC could exercise significant control over
matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational
documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such
actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.
In particular, TCCC’s ownership could have an effect on the Company’s ability to engage in a
change in control transaction. TCCC is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of
the Company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common
shares not owned by TCCC with respect to a proposal for a change of control. However, if TCCC were to
oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of
62.5% of the Company’s common shares not owned by TCCC (assuming that TCCC increased its
ownership to 20% of the Company’s common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the Company’s
outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. In addition, TCCC would have a bidding advantage
if the Company’s board of directors were to seek to sell the Company in the future because TCCC would
not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. TCCC and the Company would also
be permitted to terminate TCCC’s distribution coordination agreements with the Company after a change in
control of the Company. In such event, TCCC would receive a termination fee if TCCC terminated the
distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the Company involving certain
TCCC competitors, or if the Company terminated following a change in control of the Company involving
any third-party.
The interests of TCCC may be different from or conflict with the interests of the Company’s other
stockholders and, as a result, TCCC’s influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or
transactions. Moreover, TCCC’s ownership of a significant amount of the Company’s outstanding common
shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the Company’s common shares if TCCC
were to sell a large portion of its shares or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur.
We rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain
good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products
becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.
Our acquisition of AFF in 2016 brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of
our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. However, we also procure flavors from other independent
flavor suppliers. We do not operate our own manufacturing facilities for finished goods, but instead
outsource manufacturing of our finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. As a result, in the
event of a disruption and/or delay, and/or demand exceeding forecasted demand, we may be unable to
procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short
time period. In addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international
markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products. For example, in 2021,
sales of many of our product lines were adversely impacted by production capacity constraints as a result
of above forecast demand. A lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of our products could
significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products, because alternative co-packing facilities in
the United States and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products
either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all.
In addition, recently there has been a consolidation of co-packers. If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our largest co-packers, or if our costs of co-packing increase, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Table of Contents
26We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our
business could suffer.
Many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other
carbonated, non-carbonated and other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly
with our products.
Unilateral decisions by bottlers/distributors, buying groups, convenience chains, grocery chains,
mass merchandisers, specialty chain stores, club stores, e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites and
other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, restrict
the range of our products they carry, impose restrictions or limitations on the sale of our products and/or
devote less resources to the sale of our products could cause our business to suffer. In addition, possible
trading disputes between our bottler/distributors and their customers or buying groups may result in the
delisting of certain of the Company’s products, temporarily or otherwise. Bottler/distributor consolidation
may also have an impact on our business.
The TCCC North American Bottlers, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-
Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola (China), COFCO Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Beverages
Africa and Coca-Cola İçecek are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. As a
result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with these bottlers/distributors, or they do not
effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our products
could be adversely affected.
A decision by our primary domestic and international bottlers/distributors or any other large
customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
The marketing efforts of our bottlers/distributors are important for our success. If our brands prove
to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers and
distributors, and/or our bottlers/distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Disruption in distribution channels and/or a decline in sales due to the termination and/or
insolvency of existing or new bottlers/distributors may adversely affect our business and operating results.
We derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink
category could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes
impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the
trading price of our common stock.
Virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including our Monster Energy® brand
energy drinks, our Reign Total Body Fuel® energy drinks and our Strategic Brands energy drinks
(including our affordable brand energy drinks, principally Predator®). Any decrease in the sales of our
Monster Energy® brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues
and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy
drink category as well as from the energy shot category. For a discussion of such competition, see “Part I,
Item 1 – Business – Competition.”
Table of Contents
27The increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space in retail stores,
including in beverage coolers, may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the
marketplace. In addition, certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading
claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as competitors selling
misbranded products, could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the energy drink category could
impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally
could adversely affect us.
An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, other ingredients in energy drinks or energy
drinks generally, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other
ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, including product safety concerns, could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Articles critical of the caffeine
content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy
drinks have been published in recent years. We believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the
U.S. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to
appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients
(including caffeine), and/or the levels thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. In
early 2018, certain retailers in the United Kingdom announced the introduction of voluntary retailer
measures to prevent the sale of energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. If reports, studies or
articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, or
additional voluntary measures are taken, they could adversely affect the demand for our products. If we are
unable to satisfy all criteria set forth in any model energy drink guidelines, including, without limitation,
those adopted by the American Beverage Association, of which we are a member, and/or any international
beverage associations, it could negatively affect our overall reputation, which in turn could have a negative
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Increased competition in the beverage industry and changing retail landscape could hurt our business.
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing,
packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing
strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of
manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources
than we do.
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the efficacy, taste and flavor
of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique
cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. The
success of our sports marketing, social media and other general marketing endeavors may impact our
business, financial condition and results of operation. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments
and in some cases with products of much larger competitors, including the products of numerous nationally
and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Red Bull GmbH and KDP. We also compete
with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. Our products also compete
with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club
stores.

28The rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce
applications and subscription services, and closures of physical retail operations, particularly during, and
potentially following, the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations
to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. As we build our e-commerce capabilities, we may
not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers
without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail
channels. If we are unable to profitably expand our own e-commerce capabilities and/or if e-commerce
retailers take significant market share away from traditional retailers our business may be adversely
affected. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology
puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. Sales in gas chains may also be affected by
increased gasoline prices, improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric
or alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a
corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. If we are unable to
successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall
financial results could be negatively affected.
Due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter
difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. If our
revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our inability to implement our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and new
sectors, such as the alcohol beverage sector, or successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets could
adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business
growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The
success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer
preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and
results of operation could be adversely affected.
On February 17, 2022, we acquired CANarchy, a craft beer and hard seltzer company and may
continue to make acquisitions that expand our business into new sectors in the beverage industry. Risks
associated with entering into a new sector include: (1) having no or limited experience in such sector; (2)
increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements; (3) difficulties
developing, manufacturing, and marketing the products of newly acquired companies in a way that
enhances the performance of our combined businesses and product lines; and (4) our lesser familiarity with
consumer preferences in the new sector. Entry into new sectors of the beverage industry will bring us into
competition with new competitors with a larger, more established market presence. We cannot ensure that
our entry into the alcohol beverage sector or any other new beverage sectors will be profitable and future
profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.
Overall, the effectiveness of these acquisitions can be less predictable than developing new lines of
energy drinks and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. Integrating the
operations of acquired businesses could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a
number of risks including, but not limited to, the integration of company cultures and management teams,
retaining key employees and customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and
compliance requirements, increased costs, and use of resources. Even if we successfully integrate acquired
businesses, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition over
the timeframe we expect, or at all, or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of
acquisitions. The costs of achieving these benefits could also be higher than we expected. Therefore, the
acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may
not achieve profit margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated
strategic financial benefits of such transactions.

29Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for our products.
The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer
preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness and
nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened
beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. Some consumer advocacy groups and
others have expressed concerns regarding certain ingredients in diet sodas, which are contained in certain
of our energy drinks. There are also changes in demand for different packages, sizes and configurations.
This may reduce demand for our beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our
results of operations.
Consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend, in part,
upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to
consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce
different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of efficacy, taste, quality and price,
although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will
continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products
and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change. The beverages we
currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such
beverages will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through
product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as
shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with customers embracing shopping by way
of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be
unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences or engage with our customers on
their preferred platforms. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected.
Our continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in
international markets.
We have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets. Our net
sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 37%, 33% and 32% of consolidated net
sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As our growth strategy includes
further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our
products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected. In many international
markets, we have limited operating experience and in some international markets we have no operating
experience. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote
our brands in international markets. Our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are
expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the United States. We
face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including:
economic and/or political instability in our international markets; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including
possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions.
These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in
international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Also, our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to
appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties
in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped
long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and
distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.

30If we are not able to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials, including aluminum cans and/or
ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing, such inability could harm our business and result in a
higher cost base. Shortages of raw materials including aluminum cans and/or ingredients and/or fuel
and/or costs of co-packing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap
cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, caps, flavors, juice concentrates, glucose,
sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, coffee, tea, cocoa, supplement ingredients and other packaging
materials, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. For certain flavors purchased from
third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or our
Strategic Brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of
their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in
the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to
obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor
suppliers generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party
customers. We have identified alternative suppliers for certain of the ingredients contained in many of our
beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavor ingredients, flavors, fruits and fruit juices,
coffee, tea, cocoa, dairy-based products, packaging materials (including aluminum cans) supplement
ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be, encountered, which
could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products. In addition, certain of our co-
packing arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their fees based on certain of their own cost
increases. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or
ingredients, many of which have recently risen significantly, will continue to rise or may rise in the future.
We are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. Although we
generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with
securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, from time to time, we, through our aluminum can
suppliers, enter into purchase agreements for the purchase of aluminum, as well as enter into purchase
agreements for portions of our annual anticipated requirements for certain of our other raw materials such
as glucose, sugar and sucralose. In recent years, the United States has imposed tariffs on steel and
aluminum as well as on goods imported from certain countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United
States on a broader range of imports, or further trade measures taken by other countries, could result in an
increase in supply chain costs.
Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products or maintain sufficient inventory levels could
adversely affect our business and financial results.
We may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability
to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less
precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand
for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to,
aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET
plastic bottles, caps, labels, sucralose, flavor ingredients, flavors, supplement ingredients, juice
concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, cocoa, protein and packaging materials or experience
difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might
not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice
concentrates, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future,
be experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. We generally do not use
hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with
and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial results.

31If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take
to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be
negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with
distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or
lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory
levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is
too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future
sales and adversely affect our operating results.
The costs of packaging supplies, ocean and domestic freight, and inflation generally may adversely affect
our results of operations.
Many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for
packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce
those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, PET plastic for bottles and pulp and paper for cartons
and/or trays. These changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined
times that vary by product and supplier. In some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging
supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. In other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the
costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these
packaging supplies. We do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. Recently, inflation has
affected, and continues to affect, our raw materials costs, commodities and other inputs globally. If the
costs of packaging supplies and other costs, as well as ocean and domestic freight rates, continue to
increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments
to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our
business.
Because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political
conditions, civil unrest, protests and demonstrations, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed
against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the
outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as
hurricanes, wildfires, tornados, earthquakes or floods, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such
as the COVID-19 pandemic). Such catastrophic events could impact our operations and our supply chain,
including the production and/or distribution of our products. Materials and/or personnel may need to
mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a large part of our operations are located in California, a
state at greater risk of earthquakes and wildfires. Some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes
of cans, are available from limited suppliers, and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers
could adversely impact our operations. In addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic
activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products,
thereby reducing demand for our products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our
business as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected.
Climate change and natural disasters may affect our business.
There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns
around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather
patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases
or other health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice
concentrates, supplements and other ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of
communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also
impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact demand for our products.
Table of Contents
32Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or
floods, and outbreaks of diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other health issues may affect our
operations and the operation of our supply chain, impact the operations of our bottlers/distributors and
unfavorably impact our consumers’ ability to purchase our products. The predicted effects of climate
change may also result in challenges regarding availability and quality of water, or less favorable pricing
for water, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, public
expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and
raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Changes
in applicable laws, regulations, standards or practices related to greenhouse gas emissions, packaging and
water scarcity, as well as initiatives by advocacy groups in favor of certain climate change-related laws,
regulations, standards or practices, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other
financial obligations, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sales
of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we
operate. We, our bottlers and our contract packers, use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of
our beverage products that are derived from agricultural commodities such as sugar, coffee, tea and cocoa.
Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world
as a result of changing weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of
such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world.
Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an
effect on our operations, either positively or negatively.
If we are not able to retain the services of our workforce, there may be an adverse effect on our operations
and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements.
Our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our workforce. We do not
maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. The loss of services of
either Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Hilton Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and
Co-Chief Executive Officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect
our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of personnel with
the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified
personnel on acceptable terms.

33Negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate reputation,
and may cause our business to suffer.
Our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products,
new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no assurance that
our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality,
human rights and environmental sustainability will have the desired impact on our products’ brand image
and on consumer preferences and demand. Claims regarding product safety, quality and/or ingredient
content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), our culture and our workforce, our
environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, or allegations of product contamination,
even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other
products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we, our employees,
bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are
perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including
with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of our customers, or the
use of customer data. Furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely
affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and
regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our
competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. Negative postings or comments on
social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands, even if inaccurate or
malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the
Company. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our
bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand
value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on consumer demand
for our products as well as our reputation and financial results. The impact of such incidents may be
exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media
(including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation.
In addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to
our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the subject
of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and
consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to
negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with
organizations we sponsor or support. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain,
with human and workplace rights, environmental or animal rights issues could adversely impact our
corporate image and reputation. We have made a number of commitments to respect human rights,
including the policies and initiatives described in our California Transparency in Supply Chains Act &
United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act statement. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting the
human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived
failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights
laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; adverse
publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, our environmental
impact and the sustainability of our operations, labor relations, our culture and our workforce or the like
could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a
negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers.

34Government Regulation and Litigation Risks
Changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level and
proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including,
prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental
programs), limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages, require certain product labeling
disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age restrictions for the sale
of energy drinks. For a discussion of certain of such legislation, see “Part I, Item 1 – Business –
Government Regulation.” Furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the United States and
other countries at the federal, state, local, municipal and supranational level in respect of each of the
foregoing subject areas. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public
health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative
change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been increased focus on caffeine
content in beverages, and we are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy drinks. To the extent
any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are
sold, individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for, or availability of, our
energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are also
currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the FD&C Act; the
Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; data privacy laws; California
Proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the
production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling, packaging and ingredients of such products.
Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also
subject to numerous statutes and regulations.
If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product, its label, or a production run is not in
compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or the products in question may have to be
recalled, removed from the market, reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Significant changes to or failure to comply with various environmental laws may expose us to liability
and/or cause certain of our facilities to close, relocate or operate at reduced production levels, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We, and our co-packers, are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state,
regional, local, and international environmental laws, including statutes and regulations, which aim to
regulate emissions and impacts to air, land, and water. Our operations may result in odors, noise, or other
pollutants being emitted from our facilities. Failure to comply with these environmental laws or any future
changes to them could result in alleged harm to our employees or others near our facilities, significant costs
to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of
penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts. In 2021, an AFF facility, which
manufactures the primary flavors for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, received notices of violation
for emitting odors and for failing to properly permit its equipment. Failure to comply with the notices and
remediate certain emissions at this facility, or other facilities, may result in penalties, liability for damages,
alterations to our facilities’ operations, or the closing or relocation of a facility. Such actions may result in
flavor shortages, which could in turn result in shortages for our finished products and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Table of Contents
35Increasing concern over environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, including climate
change, will likely result in new or revised laws and regulations aimed at reducing or mitigating the
potential effects of greenhouse gases, restricting or increasing the costs of commercial water use due to
local water scarcity concerns, or increasing mandatory reporting of certain ESG metrics, such as recycling.
If we fail to comply with applicable environmental compliance mandates or fail to meet sustainability
metrics, our business operations and our reputation could be adversely impacted.
We cannot predict the effect of possible inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other
government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing,
promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products.
We are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general
and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing,
promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks, and we are a party, from time to time, to
various government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings. Defending these proceedings can result in
significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management’s time and attention from the
operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations.
In addition, from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate
the safety of caffeine and other ingredients in energy drinks. If an inquiry by a state attorney general or
other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing,
promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or
regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the
usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion
practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
Litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant
liabilities and reduce demand for our products, thus negatively affecting our financial results.
We have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings,
including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising,
product liability, breach of contract claims, claims from prior distributors, labor and employment matters,
personal injury matters, consumer class actions, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions.
Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our
advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in
compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that our products are not safe. Putative class action
lawsuits have also been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their
advertisements amount to false advertising. We do not believe any statements made by us in our
promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local
law, or that our products are in any way unsafe, and we vigorously defend such lawsuits.
Any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention
arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and
managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against
us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. Our failure to
successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent
not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and
profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
Table of Contents
36If we encounter material product recalls, our business may suffer material losses and such recalls could
damage our brand image and corporate reputation, also resulting in material losses.
We may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers,
markets, retailers or batches or reformulate certain of our products if such products become contaminated,
damaged, mislabeled, defective or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory
requirements. A material product recall could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image and
corporate reputation. We do not maintain recall insurance.
Intellectual Property, Information Technology and Data Privacy Risks
Our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially
adversely affect our business.
We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. We also own the copyright
in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. We regard our trademarks, copyrights
and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property
through registration and enforcement actions. However, there can be no assurance that other parties will not
infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. We also have been,
and may in the future be, unable to use our trademarks, trade names or designs and/or trade dress in certain
countries, which may impact sales of the affected brands and require increased expenditures, which could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We must continually maintain, monitor, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems,
including protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats.
Information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain
financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not
appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper
technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of
customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security
breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving, may be
difficult to detect for periods of time, and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware,
ransomware and viruses), phishing and social engineering, attempts to gain unauthorized access to
networks, computer systems and data, malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of
information they are entitled to access), cyber extortion and other forms of electronic security breaches.
Such attacks could lead to disruptions in or loss of access to our data or business systems, an inability to
process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise
protected information, lost revenues or other costs due to office, plant, warehouse or other facility
disruption or shutdown, and corruption of data.
We rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, bottlers, contract
packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other
external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-
party service providers and partners, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar risks as we are
relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee
failures. While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party
service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or
governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal,
reputational and operational risk. These third parties may experience cybersecurity incidents that may
involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us, and the need to coordinate with such
third-parties, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information
concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise.
However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could
potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure.

37Moreover, if our data management systems, including our SAP enterprise resource planning
system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business
(whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or
human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with
applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could
materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness
with which we report our internal and external operating results.
If we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse
publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our
business and operating results.
We receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable
individuals (“personal data”), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business.
As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to
personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other
jurisdictions at any time. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
became effective in May 2018 for all member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for
companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the European Union different from those
that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect
on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches
and imposes operational requirements on companies that process personal data of California residents,
including making new disclosures to consumers about data collection, processing and sharing practices and
allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.
Changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as other changes to existing personal data
protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, subject the Company to, among
other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business practices and
security systems, policies, procedures and practices. There can be no assurances that our security controls
over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor management processes,
and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the improper processing or breaches
of personal data. Data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of personal data in violation of the
GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws and regulations, could harm our
reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including
fines), or result in private litigation against us, which may result in potential loss of revenue, increased
costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal prosecution, thereby negatively impacting
our business and operating results.
Financial Risks
Fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
Therefore, we are subject to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once.
We are in various stages of examination with certain states and certain foreign jurisdictions,
including the United Kingdom and Ireland. Our 2018 through 2020 U.S. federal income tax returns are
subject to examination by the IRS. Our state income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2017
through 2020 tax years.
At any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits
will be resolved and thus, there could be significant variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates,
because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions.
Table of Contents
Changes in U.S. tax laws as a result of any legislation proposed by the new U.S. Presidential
Administration or U.S. Congress, which may include efforts to change or repeal the 2017 Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act and the federal corporate income tax rate reduction, could adversely affect our provision for
income taxes, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition,
changes in the manner in which U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including
changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial condition
or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(“OECD”) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its
base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project. These changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax
uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of
operations and/or cash flow. In connection with the OECD’s BEPS project, companies are required to
disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater
audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax
revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or
regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any
related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on
our financial condition or results of operations.
We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible
assets become impaired.
Under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we are required to
review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the
carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated
growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and
slower growth rates in our industry.
We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in
which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. Any such charge would adversely
impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill totaled approximately $1.33
billion and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.07 billion.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits,
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We enter into forward currency
exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion
of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional
currency denominated assets and liabilities. We have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign
currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, our
reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable
impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely
to be unsustainable over time. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, aggregate foreign
currency transaction gains (losses), including the gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts,
amounted to $0.3 million, ($11.2) million and ($4.1) million, respectively.
Potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial
results.
We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on
our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported
earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. Equally, increases
in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or
indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products’ affordability
and reduce our sales.
38
Table of Contents
39If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the Company could be
materially and adversely affected.
We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over
financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in “Part II, Item 9A – Controls and
Procedures.” If we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed.
Uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions
in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and
results of operations.
Global economic uncertainties, including highly inflationary economies and foreign currency
exchange rates, affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately
forecast and plan our future business activities. There can be no assurance that economic improvements
will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to
us. In addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the
impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the United States has
increased our exposure to any developments or crises in African, Asian, European and other international
markets. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets
and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other
international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing
power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Included in the foregoing are long-term uncertainties
surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly
referred to as “Brexit”) and any resulting increases in tariffs, importation restrictions, out of stocks,
volatility in currency exchange rates, including the valuation of the euro and the British pound in particular,
changes in the laws and regulations applied in the United Kingdom or impacts on economic and market
conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states and elsewhere.
Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur
significant losses.
As part of any hedging activities that we may conduct, we may enter into transactions involving
derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option
contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. We also have significant amounts of cash,
cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions
both in the United States and abroad, exposing us to risk of default by or failure of such counterparty
financial institutions. This risk of counterparty default or failure is greater during periods of economic
downturn or uncertainty in financial markets. If one of our counterparties became insolvent or filed for
bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred due to the default or to retrieve assets deposited or held in
accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or applicable laws
governing insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings. Default by or failure of one or more of our
counterparties could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations and
financial condition.
Table of Contents
40Volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities.
Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial
results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market
conditions such as inflation, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments
by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control.
We do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues,
margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. We may be unable to achieve analysts’ net
revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and
sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as
well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will
achieve any such projected levels or mix of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or
net income. As a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able
to sell our stock at attractive prices. In addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could
result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. During the fiscal year ended December

Statements” and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the
following sections:
●The COVID-19 Pandemic – a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
business employees and operations;
●Our Business – a general description of our business, the value drivers of our business, and
opportunities and risks facing our Company, stock repurchases, acquisitions and divestitures;

Statements” and “Part II, Item 7A – Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market
Risks”).
The COVID – 19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business. The duration and
severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be
accurately predicted, including new information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the
emergence of new variants, the actions taken to limit its spread and the economic impact on local, regional,
national and international markets. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
We continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic with a global task force team working to mitigate
the potential impacts on our people and business.
We are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers and
bottlers/distributors around the world who are endeavoring to maintain the integrity of our supply chain.
Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved record annual net sales in 2021.
As countries continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and as governments and/or local
authorities impose regulations regarding COVID-19 testing, vaccine mandates and related workplace
restrictions, there remains a risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business and
supply chain, including our ability to recruit and/or retain our employees as well as impact our co-packers,
bottlers/distributors and/or suppliers.
Table of Contents
45A reduction in demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing and consumption
patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could
adversely affect the financial conditions of retailers and consumers, resulting in reduced or canceled orders
for our products, purchase returns and closings of retail or wholesale establishments or other locations in
which our products are sold.
Our Distribution and Supply Chain
In 2021, we experienced a number of global supply chain challenges as a result of unanticipated
increases in demand, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which adversely impacted both cost of sales
and operating costs, and in certain markets, affected the availability of our products on shelves at retailers.
In particular, we have experienced shortages in our aluminum can requirements, freight inefficiencies,
shortages of shipping containers, port of entry congestion, and delays in the receipt and/or availability of
certain ingredients. In the United States, we lacked sufficient co-packing capacity to meet increased
demand for certain of our products. We have also experienced increased aluminum can costs attributable to
higher aluminum commodity pricing as well as the costs of importing aluminum cans. In addition, we
experienced increased ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel,
co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, increased outbound freight costs and production
inefficiencies, which resulted in increased costs of sales and increased operating costs.
We have addressed and will continue to address the controllable challenges in our supply chain,
which remains largely intact. Additional can manufacturing capacity in the United States has been secured
for 2022, although the Company will continue to import aluminum cans to supplement its domestic can
supply. Can capacity in EMEA remains challenging and the Company expects to continue to import
aluminum cans into EMEA for at least 2022. While co-packing capacity in the United States and EMEA
also continues to be challenging, we have expanded our network in the United States and EMEA to
substantially address supply constraints. Our flavor facility in Athy, Ireland is operational, producing
certain flavors and blends for the EMEA region, is steadily increasing production, and is investigating the
feasibility of a juice plant to produce EMEA’s juice product requirements. We continue to implement
measures to mitigate our increased operating costs through pricing actions and reductions in promotions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of the date of this filing, we expect to maintain substantial liquidity as we manage through the
current environment as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.

The comparative results of operations for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 included a
non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $165.1 million due to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets
between certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a step-up of the tax-deductible
basis in the transferred assets in a foreign jurisdiction, and created a temporary difference between the tax
basis and the book basis for such intangible assets (the “Non-Recurring Tax Benefit”), as well as reduced
marketing, sponsorships and certain other operating expenses, largely as a consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic. These items should be taken into consideration when evaluating comparative performance for
the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the twelve-months ended December 31,
2020.
Our net sales of $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented record annual net
sales. The comparative net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2
million related to product returns from our customers as a result of a European formulation issue with a
limited number of products in Europe and a labeling issue concerning one product in Japan (the “Product
Returns”). Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of
approximately $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Net
sales of our Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $5.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net sales of our Strategic Brands segment were $294.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our
Monster Energy® Drinks segment represented 94.2% and 93.6% of our net sales for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our Strategic Brands segment represented 5.3% and 5.8% of
our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our Other segment
represented 0.5% and 0.6% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The comparative net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment for the year ended December 31, 2020
were negatively impacted by $15.2 million related to the Product Returns.
Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net sales of the
Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $57.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Net changes in foreign currency

Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Net sales to customers outside
the United States amounted to $2.04 billion, $1.51 billion and $1.33 billion for the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such sales were approximately 37%, 33% and 32% of net sales for
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The comparative net sales to customers
outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by $15.2 million
related to the Product Returns.
Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty

CANarchy Acquisition
On February 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC
(“CANarchy”), a craft beer and hard seltzer company, for $330.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments. The
transaction allows us to enter the alcohol beverage
Table of Contents
48sector and brings the Cigar City family of brands including Jai Alai IPA and Florida Man IPA, the Oskar Blues family
of brands including Dale’s Pale Ale and Wild Basin Hard Seltzers, the Deep Ellum family of brands including Dallas
Blonde and Deep Ellum IPA, the Perrin Brewing family of brands including Black Ale, the Squatters family of brands
including Hop Rising Double IPA and Juicy IPA and the Wasatch family of brands including Apricot Hefeweizen to
our beverage portfolio. The transaction does not include CANarchy’s stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational
structure for our existing energy beverage business will remain unchanged. CANarchy will function independently,
retaining its own organizational structure and team.
Value Drivers of our Business
We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:
●International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our
brands internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our
products are distributed in approximately 154 countries and territories worldwide.
●Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added beverage brands supported by
marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We
are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our Monster Energy® Drinks segment
and our Strategic Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and
distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these
strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.
●Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on mitigating
increases and/or reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis,
including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing
additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease
promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships,
sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.
●Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital
in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our
strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost
of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for
accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.
We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these
value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in:
(1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time
through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital.
The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.
Net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key
measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus
in 2022 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations – Results of Operations”).
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had working capital of $3.72 billion compared to $2.39
billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the $1.38
billion of net income earned during the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31,
2021, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.16 billion as compared to $1.36
billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Principal uses of cash flows in 2021, were purchases of
investments, development of our Monster Energy® brand internationally and
Table of Contents
49acquisitions of real property, property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be
and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7
– Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and
Capital Resources”).
Opportunities, Challenges and Risks
Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage
industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s
status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under
“Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or
municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy
drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain
governmental programs), limit caffeine content, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or
warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In
addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles
indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such
legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation
or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or
volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the
stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our
international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including
the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending
also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and
regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to
represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our
commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low
calorie beverages within our energy drink product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer
needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).
Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative
beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part,
upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer
preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our
market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be
competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property
protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us
if we misjudge such preferences.
In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results
include, but are not limited to:
●the continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic;
●the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;
●changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;
●economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;
●the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
●maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;
●increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including
obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and
consumer preferences in response to those concerns;
Table of Contents
50●profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See
“Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and
Marketing”);
●costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;
●the risks associated with entering into new sectors in the beverage industry, in particular the
alcohol beverage sector, and making acquisitions to implement our growth strategy;
●increases in costs of raw materials used by us;
●restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government
regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients
including flavors, flavor ingredients and supplement ingredients, due to port strikes and/or port
congestion, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, related labor issues or other importation
impediments;
●protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the
continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for
our expanding product lines;
●limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans;
●the increased costs resulting from importing aluminum cans and other raw materials and
ingredients;
●limitations on co-packing availability;
●increases in ocean and domestic freight rates;
●shortages of shipping containers and port congestion;
●the long-term impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom; and
●the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy
drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings,
imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions.
See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties
facing our Company.
We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:
●domestic and international growth potential of our products;
●growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally;
●growth potential of the affordable energy drink category;
●planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing
sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;
●the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;
●package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;
●effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;
●broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;
●launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and
international markets and channels;
●continued focus on reducing our cost base ; and
●our entry into the alcohol category and development of our alcoholic portfolio.

approximately $220.3 million, or 20.2% higher than total operating expenses of $1.09 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 23.7% for both the years

the year ended December 31, 2021, was partially offset by $16.9 million due to the reversal of amounts
previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim. During the comparative 2020 period,
the Company decreased expenditures for sponsorship and endorsements and decreased expenditures for
travel and entertainment, each largely as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic was less pronounced on our sales and marketing programs during the year ended

**Gr oss billings represent amounts invoiced to customers net of cash discounts and returns. Gross billing s are used internally by
management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products,
salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The
use of gross billings allow s evaluation of sales performance befor e the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain
performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating
performance. The use of gross billings is not a measur e that is recognized under GAAP  and should not be consider ed as an
alternative to net sales, which is determined in accor dance with GAAP , and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating
performance in place of net sales. Additionally , gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measur es used by other
companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be realized in
the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain
customers.
The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross billings with the most

***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation
thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be
comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to our
bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions
to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers,
including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to
bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting,
shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors
and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our
bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and
(viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an
evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other
allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs with our numerous bottlers/distributors
and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more
of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and
other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market
conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail.
Sales
The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past three years.
Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.
Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement
equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the
number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into
finished products, sold by us.
Table of Contents
56Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased
demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower
during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink
products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly
fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening
of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new
bottlers/distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or
increased advertising and promotional expenses. (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Seasonality”).

Inflation
Inflation had a negative impact on our results of operations, leading to increased cost of sales and
operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021. Inflation did not have a significant impact on
our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2021, we
had $1.33 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.75 billion in short-term investments and $99.4 million in
long-term investments, including certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency
securities, U.S. treasuries, and to a lesser extent, municipal securities. We maintain our investments for
cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize
credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our
investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks.
However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.
These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Of our $1.33 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2021, $608.6 million was
held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign
subsidiaries at December 31, 2021.
We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line
of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw
materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and
development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets,
equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital
expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are currently estimated to be approximately $150.0
million through December 31, 2022. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this
estimate.
Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property
and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances
for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of
accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our
principal recurring use of cash.

primarily attributable to a $156.9 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $120.1 million increase in
accounts receivable and a $21.5 million decrease in deferred revenue.
Cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $992.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $472.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020.
For both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash provided by investing activities was
primarily attributable to sales of available-for-sale investments. For both the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-
sale investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash used in investing activities
also included the acquisition of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other
equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and
fixtures, office and computer equipment, real property, computer software, equipment used for sales and
administrative activities, certain leasehold improvements, improvements to real property as well as the
acquisition, defense and maintenance of trademarks. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in
excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold
improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles,
coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of
production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our
brand in international markets) and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also use cash
to purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses.

59Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was
$34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to cash used in financing activities of
($526.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash flows provided by financing activities for
both the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our
common stock related to stock-based compensation. The cash flows used in financing activities for both the
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock
related to stock-based compensation.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of
our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as
a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have
had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different
conditions or using different assumptions. See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a summary of our
significant accounting policies.
Table of Contents
60The following summarizes our most significant critical accounting estimates:
Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds
the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not
amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the
Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than
the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Application of the goodwill impairment test
requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and
liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value
of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted
cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected
future revenues, projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates. The estimates used to
calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market
conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will recognize
an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the
years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments recorded and there are no
accumulated impairment balances.
Other Intangibles – In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are
not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an
impairment exists. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty
methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use
of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief)
indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair
value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. This analysis requires significant
assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues and terminal growth rates. A significant
change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived
intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values. The Company amortizes its
trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2019 no impairments were recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an impairment
charge of $8.7 million was recorded to intangibles.
Revenue Recognition – Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a
reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail
customers including, but not limited to the following:
●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers;
●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their
promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees
for both new and existing products;
●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to
retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;
●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given
directly to retailers;
●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or
exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;
●discounted or free products;
●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly
by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales
territories; and
●commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of
TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.
Table of Contents
61The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are
executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally
provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from
one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various
programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its
anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical
experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer
participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated
expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been
insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors,”
for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those
factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could
cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-
looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our
actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking
statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections, and may be better or
worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were
made. We expressly disclaim any duty
Table of Contents
66to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them,
after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence
of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
ITEM 7A.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The
principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to
which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw
materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of juice concentrates, increases in the price of
aluminum cans, as well as sugar, sucralose and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, milk, cream, protein,
coffee and tea, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel
prices, and limited availability of aluminum cans and certain other raw materials. We generally do not use
hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient
ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities
and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the
competitive environment in which we operate.
We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest
rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.
Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 37% and 33% of
consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our growth strategy
includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into forward currency
exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion
of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional
currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as
of December 31, 2021 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange
contracts for speculation or trading purposes.
We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under FASB
ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in other
income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair
value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential loss resulting from a
hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2021 to be
significant.
As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.33 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.75 billion in short-
term investments and $99.4 million in long-term investments including certificates of deposit, commercial
paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, and to a lesser extent, municipal securities.
Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.

67ITEM 9A.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures – Under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief
Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure

end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of the
SEC and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and
principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our

conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December

Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our management’s
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.
Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation
report, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting – There were no changes in the Company’s

affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

68REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Monster Beverage Corporation
Corona, California
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Monster Beverage Corporation and
subsidiaries (the ”Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2022,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

77REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Monster Beverage Corporation
Corona, California
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Monster Beverage Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item
15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28,
2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and
that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does
not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Table of Contents
78Accrued Promotional Allowances — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its
bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of the initial product sale
for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed-upon terms as well as the
Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect
to estimating consumer participation and/or bottler/distributor and retail customer performance levels.
Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to bottlers/distributors or retail
customers, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price
promotions to end consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to bottlers/distributors for agreed
portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees
for both new and existing products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to
retailers for advertising, in-store marketing, and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting, shelf
space allowances, and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives
given to bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;
(vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to bottlers/distributors related to sales made by
the Company directly to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and
(viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to bottlers/distributors. The promotional programs are of
varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year based on the agreed-upon terms. The nature
of such programs is determined on a per retail customer basis, and in certain instances, the same program is
set for multiple retail customers. The promotional expenditures are recorded as a reduction to net sales in
the period the underlying sale occurs. Total promotional expenditures included as a reduction to net sales
were $924.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and accrued promotional allowances were
$211.5 million as of December 31, 2021.
We identified accrued promotional allowances as a critical audit matter because of the extent and subjective
nature of management judgment required with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or
distributor and retail customer performance levels and future promotional claims.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures over accrued promotional allowances, with respect to management’s judgment
regarding levels of consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels and
future promotional claims, included the following, among others:
●We tested the effectiveness of controls over accrued promotional allowances, including those
controls pertaining to management’s estimation of future promotional claims.
●We selected a sample of accrued promotional allowances recorded for specific distributors and
retail customers and sent confirmation requests of the accrual recorded and key terms of the
agreement directly to the distributor or retail customer. We compared the confirmation
response to the accrued amount recorded by the Company. In instances of nonreplies to our
confirmation request from the distributor or retail customer, we performed alternative
procedures as follows: (1) developing an expectation of the accrual using current-year claim
and payment data, and/or (2) vouching known claim submissions, unpaid as of period-end, to
underlying supporting documentation.
●We tested the promotional expenditure amount recorded as a reduction to net sales and
assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimate by developing an expectation of the
amount, based on historical promotional expenditure amounts recorded as a percentage of
sales, and compared our expectation to the recorded promotional expenditure amount.
Table of Contents
79●We performed inquiries with the Company’s sales and marketing personnel to corroborate our
understanding of new and existing promotional programs that may alter the relationship
between gross billings and promotional allowances, as such programs are considered by
management when estimating future promotional claims.
●We evaluated management’s ability to estimate promotional allowances by comparing the
actual promotional allowances subsequently paid to the original estimates of management.

861.          ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization – Monster Beverage Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of
Delaware. The Company is a holding company and has no operating business except through its
consolidated subsidiaries.
Nature of Operations – The Company develops, markets, sells and distributes energy drink
beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names:
Monster Energy®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Rehab® Monster, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Espresso
Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Hydro® Energy Water, Monster Hydro® Super
Sport, Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Monster Super Fuel®, Monster Dragon Tea®, Reign Total Body
Fuel®, Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra
Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, BPM®, BU®, Gladiator®, Samurai®, Live+®,
Predator®, Fury® and True North®.
Basis of Presentation – The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and
include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Principles of Consolidation – The Company consolidates all entities that it controls by ownership
of a majority voting interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business
Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the
acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure
goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at
their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.
Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer
than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-
acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure
certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a
business combination.
Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year,
the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits.
The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any
losses in the future.

MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
87Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-
maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are
those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading
securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not
included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 326-30-35,
a security is considered to be impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis.
Where the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss, the Company
will record an impairment relating to credit losses through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is
limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Impairment that has not been
recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income (loss), net
of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments has resulted
from credit loss or other factors at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management,
and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic
trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and, if applicable, information on
the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether an impairment has resulted
from credit loss or other factors include the length of time and extent to which the investment’s fair value
has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and
guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and the
Company’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for
any anticipated recovery of fair value.
Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable
based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is
estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company
believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts,
bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of past
due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated
balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for
those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional
allowances are shown on a gross basis.
Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net
realizable value).
Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and
fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, real property and vehicles is based
on their estimated useful lives (three to thirty years) and is calculated using the straight-line method.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms
of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs
are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are
capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any
resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.

88Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds
the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not
amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the
Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than
the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company will recognize an impairment for
the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 there were no impairments recorded and there are no accumulated
impairment balances.
Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the
Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Dragon
Tea®, Unleash the Beast!®, Rehab® Monster, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Espresso Monster®,
Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Hydro®, Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Monster Super
Fuel®, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno®, Predator®, Fury®, True North®, NOS®, Full Throttle®,
Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, BPM®, BU®,
Gladiator®, and Samurai® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution
of beverages. The Company also owns a number of other trademarks, flavors and formulas in the United
States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible
assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or
when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the
carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the
estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful
lives over their respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019 no impairments
were recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an impairment charge of $8.7 million was recorded
to intangibles.
Leases – See Note 3.
Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived
assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset
may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of
future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated
using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s
estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective
and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the
years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-
lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

89Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or
losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany
transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the
foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’
equity. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company entered into forward
currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage
a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-
functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding
as of December 31, 2021 have terms of three months or less. The Company does not enter into forward
currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.
The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions
under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts
are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the
changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. For the years ended December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019, aggregate foreign currency transaction gains (losses), including the gains or losses on
forward currency exchange contracts, amounted to $0.3 million, ($11.2) million and ($4.1) million,
respectively, and have been recorded in other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.
Revenue Recognition – See Note 2.
Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates, supplement ingredients
and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing fees,
repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred
prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In addition,
the Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and payroll costs
that relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates. Raw materials
account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers,
flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.
Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to
transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for
advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale
materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses.
Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including
legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors, depreciation and
other general and administrative costs.
Freight-Out Costs – For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, freight-out costs
amounted to $213.9 million, $134.1 million and $122.5 million, respectively, and have been recorded in
operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
90Advertising and Promotional Expenses – The Company accounts for advertising production costs
by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. A significant amount
of the Company’s promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement and sponsorship
contracts. Accounting for endorsement and sponsorship payments is based upon specific contract
provisions. Generally, endorsement and sponsorship payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over
the term of the contract after giving recognition to the periodic performance compliance provisions of the
contracts. Advertising and promotional expenses, including, but not limited to, production costs amounted
to $417.6 million, $345.7 million and $391.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Advertising and promotional expenses are included in operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set
forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to
be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when
it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need
for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax
planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded
deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the
period in which such determination is made.
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to
examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at
the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit
will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be
realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will
be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the
provisions of FASB ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options
based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the
estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance
by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-employee’s
performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based
compensation cost for restricted stock units and performance share units is measured based on the closing
fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has
the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit or performance share unit in cash, the award is
classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. See Note 15.
Net Income Per Common Share – In accordance with FASB ASC 260, net income per common
share, on a basic and diluted basis, is presented for all periods. Basic net income per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of common equivalent shares
assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury share repurchases at average market
prices, as applicable.

91Concentration of Risk – Certain of the Company’s products utilize components (raw materials
and/or co-packing services) from a limited number of sources. A disruption in the supply of such
components could significantly affect the Company’s revenues from those products, as alternative sources
of such components may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or within a reasonably short
time period. The Company continues to endeavor to secure the availability of alternative sources for such
components and minimize the risk of any disruption in production.
The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”), through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “TCCC
Subsidiaries”), accounted for approximately 2%of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 12%, 12% and 13% of the Company’s
net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC accounted for approximately 10%, 11% and 11% of the
Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Coca-Cola Europacific Partners accounted for approximately 12%, 10% and 10% of the
Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Credit Risk – The Company sells its products nationally and internationally, primarily to bottlers
and full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass
merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers
and the military. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not
require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, and historically, such losses
have been within management’s expectations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments.
Use of Estimates – The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements – In October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08, “Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 805)”. ASU No. 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to
recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts
using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the
revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the
ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim
period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which
the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of ASU No. 2021-08 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

922.          REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with
Consumers”. The Company has three operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks
segment (“Monster Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy®
drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks and True North® Pure Energy Seltzers,
(ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic Brands”), which is primarily comprised of the various energy
drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”) in 2015 as well as the Company’s
affordable energy brands, and (iii) Other segment (“Other”), which is comprised of certain products sold by
American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to independent third-party
customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”).
The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling
ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage bottlers/distributors
(“bottlers/distributors”). In some cases, the Company sells ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks directly
to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains,
drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military.
The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club
stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-
commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the Strategic Brands segment generates net
operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.
The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance
obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the
Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying
contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate
function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products passes
to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or transferred
the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms are short-
term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The
Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020.
The Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are
imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers.
Distribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing
expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
income.
Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales,
primarily include consideration given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including,
but not limited to the following:
●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers;
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
93●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their
promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees
for both new and existing products;
●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to
retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;
●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given
directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers;
●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or
exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;
●discounted or free products;
●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly
by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales
territories; and
●commissions to TCCC based on the Company’s sales to wholly-owned subsidiaries of
TCCC (the “TCCC Subsidiaries”) and/or to TCCC bottlers/distributors accounted for
under the equity method by TCCC (the “TCCC Related Parties”).
The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are
executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally
provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, typically
ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based
on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time
of initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon
terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s
judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or bottler/distributor and retail customer
performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and
other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such
differences are determined.
Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with
certain bottlers/distributors relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior
distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated
life of the respective distribution agreements, generally over 20 years.
The Company also sells and/or enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated
with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing the Company’s trademarks including, but not
limited to, clothing, backpacks, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and
spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience.

which is included in current and long-term deferred revenue in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $41.5 million, $42.1 million and $46.3
million, respectively, of deferred revenue, was recognized in net sales. See Note 10.

953.          LEASES
The Company leases identified assets comprising real estate and equipment. Real estate leases
consist primarily of office and warehouse space and equipment leases consist of vehicles and warehouse
equipment. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a
lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct
identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from
the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the
asset. At inception of a lease, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and
non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments.
Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.
Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC 842,
“Leases”. The Company’s operating leases are comprised of real estate and warehouse equipment, and the
Company’s finance leases are comprised of vehicles.
Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases generally do not
provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of
interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date.
ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that
option.
Certain of the Company’s real estate leases contain variable lease payments, including payments
based on an index or rate. Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are initially measured using
the index or rate in effect at the lease commencement date. Additional payments based on the change in an
index or rate, or payments based on a change in the Company’s portion of real estate taxes and insurance,
are recorded as a period expense when incurred.
Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.
Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over
the asset’s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of
income. Interest expense on finance leases is calculated using the amortized cost basis and is included in
other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of income.
The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to 12 years, some of which
include options to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the
leases within one year. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for
short-term operating leases that have a term of 12 months or less.

5.          FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
FASB ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures
regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to
maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The three levels of inputs required by the standard
that the Company uses to measure fair value are summarized below.
●Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or
liabilities.
●Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
FASB ASC 820 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when
measuring fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever
possible.

101All of the Company’s short-term and long-term investments are classified within Level 1 or Level
2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s valuation of its Level 1 investments is based on quoted
market prices in active markets for identical securities. The Company’s valuation of its Level 2 investments
is based on other observable inputs, specifically a market approach which utilizes valuation models, pricing
systems, mathematical tools and other relevant information for the same or similar securities. The
Company’s valuation of its Level 2 foreign currency exchange contracts is based on quoted market prices
of the same or similar instruments, adjusted for counterparty risk. There were no transfers between Level 1
and Level 2 measurements during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and there were no
changes in the Company’s valuation techniques.
6.          DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks related primarily to its foreign
business operations. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company entered into
forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically
manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’
non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered
into by the Company that were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 have terms of three months or less.
The Company does not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.
The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions
under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts
are recognized in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the
changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item.

10.          DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS
In accordance with FASB ASC 420 “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations”, the Company expenses
distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs. As a
result, the Company incurred termination costs of $5.3 million, $0.2 million and $11.3 million for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full
and are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
In the normal course of business, amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution
agreements entered into with certain bottlers/distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating
agreements with the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and are
recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally
20 years. Revenue recognized was $21.5 million, $21.4 million and $25.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
11.        DEBT
The Company entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a
revolving line of credit, which was amended in April 2020, under which the Company may borrow up to
$10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2025.
Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus 1.00% to
1.50%, or London Interbank Offered Rates plus an additional percentage of 1.25% to 1.75%, depending
upon certain financial ratios maintained by the Company. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on
this line of credit at December 31, 2021. Under this revolving line of credit, the Company may also issue
standby Letters of Credit with an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 million. The fee on the standby Letters of
Credit ranges from 1.00% to 1.50% depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by the Company.
The Company had no outstanding standby Letters of Credit at December 31, 2021.
The Company has a credit facility with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch,
of $15.0 million. At December 31, 2021, the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit was 5.5%.
As of December 31, 2021, $5.8 million was outstanding on this line of credit.

12.        COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contractual Obligations – The Company had the following contractual obligations related
primarily to sponsorships, other marketing activities and AFF new production facility construction costs as
of December 31, 2021:
Year Ending December 31:      
2022  $ 236,698
2023 57,848
2024 10,497
2025 10
2026 —
2027 and thereafter —
 $ 305,053
Purchase Commitments – The Company had purchase commitments aggregating approximately
$273.4 million at December 31, 2021, which represent commitments made by the Company and its
subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the production of its products. These obligations vary
in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year.
The Company purchases various raw material items, including, but not limited to, flavors,
ingredients, supplement ingredients, containers, milk, glucose, sucralose, cream and protein, from a limited
number of suppliers. An interruption in supply from any of such resources could result in the Company’s
inability to produce certain products for limited or possibly extended periods of time. The aggregate value
of purchases from suppliers of such limited resources described above for the years ended December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019 was $698.0 million, $401.8 million and $335.3 million, respectively.
Guarantees – The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that
contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third-party claims. These contracts
primarily relate to: (i) certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees under
which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their
employment relationship, (ii) certain distribution or purchase agreements under which the Company may
have to indemnify the Company’s customers from any claim, liability or loss arising out of any actual or
alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the consumption or purchase of the Company’s
products or the use of Company trademarks, and (iii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company
may be required to indemnify property owners for liabilities and other claims arising from the Company’s
use of the applicable premises. The terms of such obligations vary and typically, a maximum obligation is
not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate to cover any
resulting liabilities or claims.
Litigation – From time to time in the normal course of business, the Company is named in
litigation, including labor and employment matters, personal injury matters, consumer class actions,
intellectual property matters and claims from prior distributors. Although it is not possible to predict the
ultimate outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to the Company, management believes that
such litigation in aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.
The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters
that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued, if any, and any related
insurance reimbursements. As of December 31, 2021, no loss contingencies were included in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

14.        TREASURY STOCK PURCHASE
On March 13, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program
for the purchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the “March 2020
Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, no shares were purchased under the March
2020 Repurchase Plan. As of February 28, 2022, $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under
the March 2020 Repurchase Plan.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, 0.2 million shares of common stock were purchased
from employees in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding taxes due for a total amount
of $13.8 million. While such purchases are considered common stock repurchases, they are not counted as
purchases against the Company’s authorized share repurchase programs. Such shares are included in
common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021.
15.        STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has two stock-based compensation plans under which shares were available for
grant at December 31, 2021: (i) the Monster Beverage Corporation 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the
“2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan”), which includes the Monster Beverage Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan as a sub plan thereunder, and (ii) the Monster Beverage Corporation 2017
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which includes the Monster Beverage Corporation
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors as a sub plan thereunder. The 2020 Omnibus
Incentive Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on April 14, 2020 and approved by the stockholders
of the Company at the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on June 3, 2020 (the “Effective
Date”). The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan replaced the Monster Beverage Corporation 2011 Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the “2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan”).
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
108The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other share-based awards up to an
aggregate of 46,169,367 shares of the Company’s common stock, comprised of 32,000,000 new shares of
common stock reserved under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which were authorized on the Effective
Date, and 14,169,367 shares of common stock that were available for grant under the 2011 Omnibus
Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2019 and prior to the Effective Date. Shares authorized under the 2020
Omnibus Incentive Plan are reduced by one (1) share for options or stock appreciation rights granted under
the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan and for any grants after December 31, 2019 under the 2011 Omnibus
Incentive Plan, and by 2.6 shares for each share granted or issued with respect to a Full Value Award under
either the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan or for any shares granted after December 31, 2019 under the 2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan. A “Full Value Award” is an award other than an incentive stock option, a non-
qualified stock option, or a stock appreciation right, which is settled by the issuance of shares. Options
granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan may be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), or non-qualified stock options.
Shares previously granted under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan after December 31, 2019 and
prior to the Effective Date of the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan reduced the number of shares available for
grant under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 2,755,257 shares of the
Company’s common stock have been granted, net of cancellations, and 42,513,457 shares (as adjusted for
Full Value Awards) of the Company’s common stock remain available for grant under the 2020 Omnibus
Incentive Plan.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has sole
and exclusive authority to grant stock awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new hires
who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (“Section 16”). Each of the Compensation Committee
and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Executive Committee”) independently has the
authority to grant stock awards to (i) new hires and (ii) employees receiving a promotion, in each case, who
are not Section 16 employees. Awards granted by the Executive Committee are not subject to approval or
ratification by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. Options granted under the 2020
Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest over a three- to five-year period from the grant date and are
generally exercisable up to 10 years after the grant date. Restricted stock units granted under the 2020
Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest over a three- or five-year period from the grant date. Performance
share units will generally vest based on the achievement of performance goals specified for the applicable
award.
In 2016, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan (as a sub plan to the 2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan), pursuant to which eligible employees may elect to defer cash and/or equity based
compensation and to receive the deferred amounts, together with an investment return (positive or
negative), either at a pre-determined time in the future or upon termination of their employment with the
Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates that are participating employers under the Deferred Compensation
Plan, as provided under the Deferred Compensation Plan and in relevant deferral elections. Deferrals under
the Deferred Compensation Plan are unfunded and unsecured. As of December 31, 2021 deferrals under the
Deferred Compensation Plan are solely comprised of cash compensation and equity compensation and are
not material in the aggregate.
In 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Directors Plan, a successor plan to the 2009 Monster
Beverage Corporation Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2017 Directors Plan permits
the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares or restricted stock units, deferred
awards, dividend equivalents, and other share based-awards up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of
common stock of the Company to non-employee directors of the Company.

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
109Each calendar year, a non-employee director will receive an annual retainer and annual equity
award, as provided for in the 2017 Directors Plan, which may be modified from time to time. Currently,
with respect to equity awards, each non-employee director receives an award of restricted stock units at
each annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders or promptly thereafter. A non-employee director’s
annual award of restricted stock units will generally vest on the earliest to occur of: (a) the last business
day immediately preceding the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders in the calendar year
following the calendar year in which the grant date occurs, (b) a Change of Control (as defined in the 2017
Directors Plan), (c) the non-employee director’s death, or (d) the date of the non-employee director’s
separation from service due to disability, so long as the non-employee director remains a non-employee
director through such date. The Board of Directors may in its discretion award non-employee directors
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other share-based awards in lieu of or in
addition to restricted stock units. The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2017 Directors Plan
at any time, subject to certain limitations set forth in the 2017 Directors Plan. As of December 31, 2021,
98,901 shares of the Company’s common stock had been granted under the 2017 Directors Plan, and
1,151,099 shares of the Company’s common stock remain available for grant.
In 2017, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (as a
sub plan to the 2017 Directors Plan), pursuant to which the Board of Directors may permit non-employee
directors to elect, at such times and in accordance with rules and procedures (or sub-plan) adopted by the
Board of Directors (which are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, as applicable), to receive
all or any portion of such non-employee director’s compensation, whether payable in cash or in equity, on a
deferred basis. Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors are unfunded
and unsecured. As of December 31, 2021, deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-
Employee Directors are solely comprised of cash compensation and equity compensation and are not
material in the aggregate. The 2017 Directors Plan was adopted to effectuate any such deferrals. The 2017
Directors Plan is administered by the Board of Directors. Each award granted under the 2017 Directors
Plan will be evidenced by a written agreement and will contain the terms and conditions that the Board of
Directors deems appropriate.
In February 2022, the Board of Directors amended and restated the 2017 Directors Plan to require
each non-employee director to satisfy the share ownership guidelines set forth below, as may be modified
by the Board of Directors from time to time. The current share ownership guidelines provide that non-
employee directors of the Company must:
●Hold shares of Company common stock having a total value of five times the annual retainer
payable to a non-employee director (excluding any portion of the annual retainer attributable to a
non-employee director’s service as a member of a subcommittee, as a chair of a subcommittee or
as the lead independent director, as applicable). For this purpose, deferred shares or deferred
restricted stock units will be deemed held, to the extent vested.
●The minimum stock ownership level must be achieved by each non-employee director by the fifth
anniversary of such non-employee director’s initial appointment to the Board of Directors.
●Once achieved, ownership of the guideline amount should be maintained for so long as the non-
employee director retains his or her seat on the Board of Directors.
●There may be rare instances where these guidelines would place a hardship on a non-employee
director. In these cases or in similar circumstances, the Board of Directors will make the final
decision as to developing an alternative stock ownership guideline for a non-employee director
that reflects the intention of these guidelines and his or her personal circumstances.
The Company recorded $70.5 million, $70.3 million and $63.4 million of compensation expense
relating to outstanding options, restricted stock units, performance share units and other share-based
awards during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

110The tax benefit for tax deductions from non-qualified stock option exercises, disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance share units for
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $6.8 million, $10.5 million and $25.9 million,
respectively.
Stock Options
Under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans, all stock options granted through
December 31, 2021 were granted at prices based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the
date of grant. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the
estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company records compensation expense for
non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date
at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the
date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses historical data to determine
the exercise behavior, volatility and forfeiture rate of the options.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options
granted during:
        2021    2020    2019 
Dividend yield 0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  
Expected volatility 28.9%  30.4%  30.2%  
Risk-free interest rate 0.85%  0.70%  2.37%  
Expected term 5.8 Years 5.8 Years 6.0 Years
Expected Volatility: The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of
the expected volatility. Historical volatility is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a
period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option.
Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero coupon yield
curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.
Expected Term: The Company’s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the
Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on expected time to
post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses historical exercise patterns of previously
granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise patterns.

112At December 31, 2021, there was $51.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense
related to non-vested options granted to employees under the Company’s share-based payment plans. That
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units
The cost of stock-based compensation for restricted stock units and performance share units is
measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In
the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit or performance share
unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date.
The following table summarizes the Company’s activities with respect to non-vested restricted
stock units and performance share units as follows:

performance share units. The actual number of performance share units earned could range from 0% to 200% of target dependent
on the pr e-established performance goals.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted stock units and/or performance share units
granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $89.12, $62.97 and $59.79 per
share, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 0.8 million of restricted stock units and performance share
units are expected to vest.
At December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation expense relating to non-vested restricted
stock units and performance share units was $34.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.9 years.
Other Share-Based Awards
The Company has granted other share-based awards to certain employees that are payable in cash.
These awards are classified as liabilities and are valued based on the fair value of the award at the grant
date and are remeasured at each reporting date until settlement with compensation expense being
recognized in proportion to the completed requisite service period up until date of settlement. At December
31, 2021, other share-based awards outstanding included grants that vest over three years payable in the
first quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024.

16.        INCOME TAXES
The Company evaluated the various provisions of the Tax Reform Act, including, the global
intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and the foreign derived intangible income provisions. The
Company will treat any U.S. tax on foreign earnings under GILTI as a current period expense when
incurred.
The Company currently considers the earnings of its foreign entities (excluding Japan) to be
permanently reinvested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation
will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been
recorded for the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries excluding Japan. Deferred
income taxes have not been recorded for Japan, as any federal, state, or foreign withholding taxes
associated with the repatriation of those earnings would be immaterial.
The domestic and foreign components of the Company’s income before provision for income taxes
are as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 
    2021     2020     2019

During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company established full
valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, resulting from cumulative net operating losses
incurred by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company. The effect of the valuation allowances and the
subsequent related impact on the Company’s overall tax rate was to decrease the Company’s provision for
income taxes by $8.1 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, and increase the Company’s provision for income taxes $3.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $60.5 million. Of this amount, $35.2 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The
remaining $25.3 million of net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022.

116In October 2020, the Company completed an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets between
certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries to better align its international structure with its expanding
operations. The transfer resulted in a step-up of the tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets in a
foreign jurisdiction, and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and book basis for such
intangible assets. The Company recognized deferred tax assets of approximately $165.1 million, with a
corresponding reduction to the provision for income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2020 in its
consolidated financial statements. The tax deductions for the amortization of the deferred tax assets will be
recognized in the future and any amortization not deducted for tax purposes will be carried forward
indefinitely. The tax impact on the foreign subsidiary transferor was not material.
The following is a roll-forward of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits, not
including interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:

18.        EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
Employees of the Company may participate in the Monster Beverage Corporation 401(k) Plan, a
defined contribution plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating
employees may contribute into a traditional plan with pretax salary or into a Roth plan with after tax salary
up to statutory limits. The Company contributes 50% of the employee contribution, up to 8% of each

years of service = 100%). Matching contributions were $5.5 million, $4.7 million and $3.4 million for the
years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
19.        SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has three operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment,
which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high
performance energy drinks and True North® Pure Energy Seltzers, (ii) Strategic Brands segment, which is
primarily comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC in 2015 as well as the
Company’s affordable energy brands, and (iii) Other segment, which is comprised of the AFF Third-Party
Products.
The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by
selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers/distributors. In some cases, the Company sells
ready-to-drink packaged drinks directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores,
mass merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce
retailers and the military.
The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club
stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-
commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the Strategic Brands segment generates net
operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.
