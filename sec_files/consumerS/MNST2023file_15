●     BU®
●     Gladiator®

We also develop, market, sell and distribute craft beers, hard seltzers and flavored malt beverages
(“FMBs”) under a number of brands, including Jai Alai® IPA, Florida ManTM IPA, Dale’s Pale Ale®,
Wild BasinTM Hard Seltzers, Dallas Blonde®, Deep EllumTM IPA, Perrin Brewing CompanyTM Black
Ale, Hop Rising® Double IPA, Wasatch® Apricot Hefeweizen, The Beast UnleashedTM and a host of
other brands.
We also develop, market, sell and distribute still and sparkling waters under the Monster® Tour

Industry Overview
The “alternative” beverage category combines non-carbonated, ready-to-drink iced teas,
lemonades, juice cocktails, single-serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks,
energy drinks, sports drinks and single-serve still waters (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new
age” beverages, including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling
beverages. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2022 for the
“alternative” beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $72.9 billion, representing
an increase of approximately 10.4% over estimated domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2021 of
approximately $66.1 billion.
Table of Contents
Reportable Segments
We have four operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment (“Monster
Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body
Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Monster® Tour WaterTM and True North® Pure Energy Seltzers,
(ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic Brands”), which is primarily comprised of the various energy
drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”) in 2015 as well as our affordable energy
brands, (iii) Alcohol Brands segment (“Alcohol Brands”), which is primarily comprised of the various
craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of our acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective
LLC (“CANarchy”) on February 17, 2022 as well as The Beast UnleashedTM FMBs and (iv) Other
segment (“Other”), which is comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors LLC
(“AFF”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to independent third-party customers (the “AFF
Third-Party Products”).
Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some
cases, we sell directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers,
convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the
military.
Our Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
to other bottlers, full service distributors or retailers, including, retail grocery and specialty chains,
wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores,
value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment
generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and
full service beverage distributors.
Generally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating
revenues, but lower per case gross profit margin percentages than the Strategic Brands segment.
The Company’s Alcohol Brands segment primarily generates operating revenues by selling
kegged and ready-to-drink canned beers, hard seltzers and FMBs, primarily to beer distributors in the
United States.
Generally, the Alcohol Brands segment will have lower gross profit margin percentages than the
Monster Energy® Drinks segment.
For certain risks with respect to our energy drinks see “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” below.
Corporate History
In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices in
Los Angeles, California. In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a
demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc.
(“HFI”). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural Soda® brand sodas. In
1990, California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain
assets of HFI, including the right to market the Hansen’s® brand name. In 1992, Hansen Natural
Corporation acquired the Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our
ownership, the Hansen’s® beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages
within the growing “alternative” beverage category including, in particular, energy drinks. In 2012, we
changed our name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015, we
acquired various energy brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business. In 2016, we
completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner AFF.

5CANarchy Acquisition
On February 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of CANarchy, a craft beer and hard seltzer
company, for $329.5 million in cash (net of cash acquired), after certain working capital adjustments (the
“CANarchy Transaction”). The transaction facilitates our entry into the alcohol beverage sector and brings
the Cigar CityTM family of brands including Jai Alai® IPA and Florida ManTM IPA, the Oskar BluesTM
family of brands including Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild BasinTM Hard Seltzers, the Deep EllumTM family of
brands including Dallas Blonde® and Deep EllumTM IPA, the Perrin Brewing CompanyTM family of
brands including Black Ale, the Squatters® family of brands including Hop Rising® Double IPA and the
Wasatch® family of brands including Apricot Hefeweizen to our beverage portfolio. The transaction did
not include CANarchy’s stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational structure for our existing energy
beverage business remains unchanged. CANarchy is functioning independently, retaining its own
organizational structure and team.

Table of Contents
Manufacture and Distribution
AFF develops and manufactures the primary flavors for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment.
In 2022, we continued to outsource the manufacturing process for our finished goods energy drink
products to third-party bottlers and contract packers.
We purchase flavor ingredients, flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, supplement ingredients,
cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our non-alcohol products from ingredient
suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain
common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the
product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including
supplement ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved
containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/packer
may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
For our Strategic Brands segment, we primarily purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases
from ingredient suppliers, which are then sold to certain of our various third-party bottlers/distributors.
The third-party bottlers/distributors are responsible for the manufacture and packaging of the finished
products, including the procurement of all other required ingredients and packaging materials. For certain
limited products in the Strategic Brands segment, we may purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners,
juices, supplement ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our
Strategic Brand products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and
co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers
and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or
other ingredients (including supplement ingredients), for the manufacture and packaging of the finished
products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the
beverage, the bottler/co-packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
For our Alcohol Brands segment, we purchase cans, cartons, hops, malt, yeast, sugar, ethanol and
other additives and flavorings and packaging materials from ingredient and raw material suppliers to be
used in the brewing, fermentation, and packaging of alcohol beers and FMB products. We are granted a
right-of-use for any kegs used in production from a third-party supplier at a contracted rate per fill. Most
of our alcohol finished goods are manufactured at one of our seven owned or leased manufacturing
facilities, but we have started and will increase production and packaging at co-packers as we require
additional capacity.
Co-Packing Arrangements
All of our non-alcohol and certain alcohol finished goods are manufactured by various third-party
bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements
with each party. Our co-packaging arrangements vary in terms and do not generally obligate us to procure
minimum quantities of products within specified periods. However, from time to time, we may enter into
manufacturing contracts with agreed upon minimum quantities to ensure continuity of supply of certain
products in certain territories.
In some instances, subject to agreement, certain equipment may be purchased exclusively by us
and/or jointly with our co-packers, and installed at their facilities to enable them to produce certain of our
products. In certain cases, such equipment remains our property and is required to be returned to us upon
termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers, unless we are reimbursed by the co-packer
at the then book value or via a per-case credit over a pre-determined number of cases that are produced at
the facilities concerned.
For our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, we are generally responsible for arranging for the
purchase and delivery to our third-party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage
products are packaged.

Table of Contents
Our products are packaged in a number of locations, both domestically and internationally. As
distribution volumes increase in both our domestic and international markets, we will continue to source
additional packing arrangements.
Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and
may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially
underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials
including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans
with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, caps, labels, flavor ingredients, flavors, juice concentrates,
coffee, tea, supplement ingredients, ethanol, other ingredients and certain sweeteners, and/or procure
adequate packing arrangements and/or obtain adequate or timely shipment of our products, we might not
be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).
For most of our products there are limited co-packing facilities in our domestic and international
markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment to package our products. We believe a short
disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenues; however, as alternative co-
packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate long-term capacity may not be
available for such products, either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time
period, if at all, a lengthy disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly
affect our revenues.
We continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities around the world
(including in Africa, Asia, Australia, Central and South America, China, Europe, India, Mexico, the
Middle East and the United States) with adequate capacity and capability for the production of our various
products to minimize transportation costs and transportation-related damages as well as to mitigate the
risk of a disruption in production and/or importation.
Distribution Agreements
During 2022, we continued to expand distribution of our products in both our domestic and
international markets.
Distribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Net sales outside the United States
were $2.36 billion, $2.04 billion and $1.51 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively.
Monster Energy® Distribution Agreements
We have entered into agreements with various bottlers/distributors providing for the distribution
of our Monster Energy® energy drinks during initial terms of up to twenty years, which may be renewed
thereafter for additional terms ranging from one to five years, subject to certain terms and conditions,
which may vary depending on the form of the agreement. Such agreements remain in effect for their then-
current term as long as our products are being distributed, but are subject to specified termination rights
held by each party, which may include by way of example, and depending on the form of agreement,
termination upon: mutual agreement; material breach of the agreement by, or an insolvency of, either
party; deadlock; change of control; changes in legal or regulatory conditions and termination of certain
related agreements. Additionally, we are entitled to terminate certain distribution agreements at any time
without cause upon payment of a termination fee, including a limited number of distribution agreements
with TCCC network bottlers that were entered into prior to 2015.
Certain of our material distribution arrangements for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks,
as amended from time to time, are described below:
(a)Amended and Restated Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we
have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in
Canada and the United States in which bottlers from TCCC’s network of wholly or partially-
owned and independent bottlers (the “TCCC North American Bottlers”) will distribute and sell,
or continue to distribute and sell, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.

(b)Amended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant
to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries, or territories within
countries, in which we wish to appoint TCCC network bottlers to distribute and sell our Monster
Energy® brand energy drinks, subject to TCCC’s approval. In February 2020, the Amended and
Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC was renewed for an
additional five-year term.
(c)Additionally, we have entered into distribution agreements for certain of our Monster Energy®
products with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally.
All distribution territories in the United States, and substantially all distribution territories
internationally have been transitioned to TCCC network bottlers/distributors.
Strategic Brands Distribution Agreements
We have entered into distribution coordination agreements with TCCC pursuant to which we have
designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCC’s approval, territories in which TCCC
network bottlers will distribute our Strategic Brands energy drinks. We have entered into agreements with
various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally, providing for the
distribution and sale of our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
Alcohol Brands Distribution Agreements
CANarchy has entered into agreements with various beer distributors, both in the United States
and internationally, providing for the distribution of our alcohol products. Such agreements have varying
terms and durations. CANarchy, along with Monster Brewing LLC, has also entered into distribution
agreements with licensed beer distributors for the exclusive distribution of certain beverages in agreed
upon territories.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum cans,
aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, caps,
kegs, cartons as well as flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, coffee, tea,
hops, malt, yeast, ethanol, supplement ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs of which are
subject to fluctuations.
AFF is the primary flavor supplier for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. We also
purchase flavors from other suppliers as well as juices, supplement ingredients, glucose, sugar, sucralose,
other sweeteners and other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and
abroad.
For our Strategic Brands energy drinks, we purchase flavors, concentrates and/or beverage bases
from flavor suppliers including TCCC in the United States and abroad, and may purchase certain other
ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.
With regard to our Java Monster® product line, the dairy and retort co-packing industries are
subject to shortages and increased demand from time to time, which may result in production disruption
and/or higher prices.
For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in certain of our Monster
Energy® brand energy drinks, Strategic Brands energy drinks and/or our alcohol drinks, these third-party
flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession
of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and
certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates
from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers generally do not make such
flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers.
11
Table of Contents
We have entered into purchase agreements with key packaging and ingredient suppliers to
maintain an adequate supply of such packaging and ingredients for the next one to four years based on
current anticipated volume needs. Changes to those volume needs could result in shortages or excess
supply of these contracted varieties. Many outside factors such as crop yield, weather, agricultural
legislation, and the geopolitical climate could impact supply and price; however, we do source certain
ingredients from different regions and suppliers to mitigate some of this risk.
We have identified alternative suppliers for many of the ingredients contained in many of our
beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavor ingredients, flavors, fruits and fruit juices,
coffee, tea, dairy-based products, supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time
to time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our
products.
We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavor
ingredients, flavors and concentrates purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as to negotiate
arrangements with our existing suppliers, which would enable us to obtain access to certain of such
concentrates or flavor formulas under certain circumstances. We have been partially successful in these
endeavors. Additionally, in a limited number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to
obtain regulatory approvals and licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative
suppliers, manufacturers and/or distributors.
Competition
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing,
packaging, development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies. Our
products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies, many
of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include brand and product image,
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and
unique cutting-edge products, ingredients, production processes, attractive and different packaging, brand
exposure and marketing as well as pricing. We depend on our bottlers and full service beverage
distributors to prioritize our products, provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf
space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the “alternative,” energy, coffee, “functional,” and
“beyond beer” (hard seltzers, FMBs, canned cocktails and other ready-to-drink beverages) beverage
categories could cause our products to maintain or to lose market share, or we could experience price
erosion, which could materially impact our business and results of operations.
We have experienced and continue to experience competition from new entrants in the energy
drink, energy shot, beer and beyond beer categories. For instance, a number of companies which market
and distribute iced teas, coffees, juice cocktails, enhanced waters and sports drinks in various larger
volume packages in glass and plastic bottles (including BODYARMOR, Vitamin Water, CORE, Arizona,
Ocean Spray, Powerade, Prime, Gatorade Bolt 24 and Starbucks) and 12- and 16-ounce cans (such as
Mountain Dew Kickstart and Game Fuel), have added supplement ingredients to their products with a
view to marketing their products as “functional” or energy beverages or as having “functional” benefits.
We believe that many of those products contain lower levels of supplement ingredients, principally deliver
refreshment and are positioned differently from our energy or “functional” drinks.
We are also subject to increasing levels of regulatory issues including in relation to the
registration and/or taxation of our products in certain new international markets, which may put us at a
competitive disadvantage. (See “Government Regulation” below for additional information).
We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum marketing, sales efforts and
attention from our multi-brand licensed bottlers and distributors, many of which have a principal
affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and
in many cases with products of much larger and in some cases better financed competitors, including the
products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such
12

as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”), Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (“KDP”) and Red Bull GmbH. From time to
time, such larger competitors may enter into distribution agreements with certain other competitors. We
also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete
with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club
stores.
Domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, MTN Dew Amp,
MTN Dew Kickstart, MTN Dew GameFuel and MTN Dew Energy, G Fuel, Venom, VPX Redline, 5-
Hour Energy Shots, MiO Energy, VPX Bang, V8 + Energy, Uptime, hi*ball, CELSIUS, C4, Alani Nu, 3D
Energy, ZOA Energy, Rowdy Energy, GHOST Energy, Gatorade Fast Twitch, Prime Energy, Starbucks
BAYA Energy, Guayaki Yerba Mate, Optimum Nutrition, Adrenaline Shoc and many other brands.
Internationally, our energy drinks compete with Red Bull (including non-carbonated Red Bull in
China and Asia), Rockstar, V-Energy, Lucozade, and numerous local and private-label brands that usually
differ from country to country, such as HELL, Amper, Shock, Tiger, Fearless, Boost, TNT, Shark, Dragon,
Score, Sting, Hot 6, Suntory ZONE, Battery, Bullit, Flash Up, Black, Non-Stop, Bomba, Semtex, Vive
100, Dark Dog, Speed, Guarana, M-150, Lipovitan, Bacchus, Volt, Bolt, Mr. Big, Boom, Raptor, Amp,
Fusion, Hi-Tiger, Eastroc Super Drink, Carabao, Power Horse, XL, Crazy Tiger, Effect, Missile, Nocco,
Adrenaline Rush, Real Gold, War Horse, BLU, CELSIUS, Eneryeti, GURU Organic Energy and a host of
other international brands.
Our Reign Total Body Fuel® and Reign Inferno® Thermogenic Fuel high performance energy
drinks compete with VPX Bang, Adrenaline Shoc, C4, CELSIUS HEAT, NOCCO, Rockstar
XDURANCE, Ghost Energy, G Fuel, VPX Redline, Bucked Up Energy, and 3D in the performance
energy category.
Our Java Monster® product line competes directly with Starbucks Frappuccino, Starbucks
Doubleshot, Starbucks Tripleshot and other Starbucks coffee drinks, Costa Coffee, Dunkin Donuts, Stok,
High Brew, Douwe Egberts Coffee, Emmi CAFFÈ, Bang Keto Coffee, Nescafe, Black Rifle, International
Delight, Rise Brewing Co. and Black Stag.
Our Monster Hydro® Energy Water and Monster Hydro® Super Sport product lines compete
directly with BODYARMOR, Vitamin Water, Sparkling Ice, Bai, Propel, Vita Coco, Lucozade, Powerade,
Gatorade, Gatorade Fast Twitch, Gatorade Bolt24 and Prime Hydration.
Our True North® Pure Energy Seltzer product line competes directly with Celsius and Alani Nu.
Our CANarchy family of products and The Beast UnleashedTM product line competes within the
FMB, hard seltzer, and craft beer categories of the alcohol beverage industry. Competition includes
microbreweries, regional brewers, national craft brewers, and large international and domestic producers
of beers, FMBs, and hard seltzers such as Molson Coors, Constellation Brands, AB InBev, The Boston
Beer Company and The Mark Anthony Group among many others.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy for all our non-alcohol beverages is to focus our efforts on
developing brand awareness through image-enhancing programs and product sampling. We support our
non-alcohol brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected
public and sports figures, sports personality endorsements, sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes,
teams, series, bands, esports, causes and events. We utilize “push-pull” methods to enhance shelf and
display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store
promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for
our products. In-store posters, outdoor posters, social media, concerts, print, radio and television
advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to
promote our brands. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer
samples of our products to consumers. These strategies and activities may apply to the CANarchy family
of products or The Beast UnleashedTM where permitted by applicable laws.

14We also manage taprooms and brewpubs adjacent to some of our manufacturing locations where
we sell our alcohol products, merchandise, and food to consumers in a branded environment.
We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our
brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers.
We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them
different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned and refreshed from
time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which
we continue to reevaluate from time to time.
Where appropriate, we partner with our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers to assist our
marketing efforts.
We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 11.4% in the
twelve-months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021.
Customers
Our non-alcohol customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery
and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice
customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. Our alcohol customers are primarily beer
distributors who in turn sell to retailers within the alcohol distribution system. Percentages of our gross
billings to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are
reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned,
which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service
beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed
below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service
bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors’ sales to their own customers.

Seasonality
Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar
quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage industry is affected
by weather conditions. However, the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal than traditional
beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new
products, the opening of new markets, particularly internationally, where temperature fluctuations may be
more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our
finished products and increased or decreased advertising and promotional expenses.

We presently have more than 17,500 registered trademarks and pending applications in various
countries worldwide, and we apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis. We regard our trademarks,
service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and other intellectual property as very important to
our business. We consider Monster®, Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Dragon

of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.
We also enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or disparaging
our trademarks by opposing registration of conflicting trademarks and initiating litigation as necessary.
Table of Contents
Government Regulation
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to
various U.S. federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and
regulations governing workplace health and safety; various environmental statutes; the Safe Drinking
Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“California Proposition 65”); various state and federal laws
and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of alcohol beverages; data privacy and personal data
protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by
the California Privacy Rights Act) and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations
applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging, and
ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of
our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations.
We also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations
or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors – Changes in
government regulation, or a failure to comply with existing regulations related to energy drinks, could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,” “Regulations concerning our
alcohol beverages may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and
inhibit the sales of such products,” and “Significant changes to or failure to comply with various
environmental laws may expose us to liability and/or cause certain of our facilities and/or those of our co-
packers to close, relocate or operate at reduced production levels, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations” below for additional information.
Furthermore, legislation and regulation may be introduced in the United States and other
countries at the federal, state, municipal and supranational level in respect of each of the subject areas
discussed below. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health
consequences associated with obesity and alcohol consumption, especially as they may affect children,
and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened and alcohol beverages. There
also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages and we are seeing some attention to
other ingredients in energy drinks. In some territories, such as the European Union, food additives
including sweeteners such as sucralose are subject to a safety re-evaluation which could potentially lead to
changes in the specification for such additives or removal from the approved list of additives.
Product Formulation, Labeling, Packaging, and Advertising. Globally, we are subject to a number
of regulations applicable to the formulation, labeling, packaging, and advertising (including promotional
campaigns) of our products. In California, we are subject to California Proposition 65, a law which
requires that a specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that
contains in excess of threshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause
cancer or reproductive toxicity. California Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer
of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average
daily quantity of a listed substance that is below that threshold amount, which is determined either by
scientific criteria set forth in applicable regulations or via a “safe harbor” threshold that may be
established by the state, or the substance is naturally occurring, or is subject to another applicable
exception. If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain
locations where our products are sold, it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a
warning would have an adverse impact on sales of our products in those locations or elsewhere. In
addition, there has been increasing regulatory activity globally regarding constituents in packaging
materials, including perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”). Regardless of whether
perceived health consequences of these constituents are justified, such regulatory activity could result in
additional government regulations that impact the packaging of our beverages.
In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has regulations with respect to
serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products, including a requirement to
disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. Further, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
promulgated regulations requiring that, by January 1,
16
Table of Contents
2022, the labels of certain bioengineered foods include a disclosure that the food is bioengineered. These
regulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by
consumers.
Other countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the member states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, Mexico, the People’s Republic of China, Peru and Uruguay are also considering, or have
enacted, new labeling requirements, which may require us to amend our labels and warning statements.
The United Kingdom Government has also suggested that it may review food labeling laws following the
United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (“Brexit”).
More generally, some markets, such as Tanzania, have specific energy drink standards that do not
always allow for inclusion of certain ingredients, such as L-carnitine and ginseng, in our products. Peru
also recently challenged the use of L-carnitine in energy drinks. Other markets may also restrict or
prohibit the use of ginseng and certain other botanicals in food. We may incur costs to address such
country-specific requirements for or face restrictions on our products.
Age and Other Restrictions on Energy Drink Products. Proposals to limit or restrict the sale
and/or advertising of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age, and/or restrict the
venues in which energy drinks can be sold, and/or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised and/or enacted in
certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and/or in certain foreign countries. For example, in the United
States, bills seeking to impose an age restriction on the sale of energy drinks have been introduced in the
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and South Carolina legislatures. Outside of the United States, for example,
Latvia, Lithuania, Turkey, and Bahrain prohibit the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18;
Canada prohibits the promotion of energy drinks to children 12 years and under; Latvia and Scotland
prohibit the sale of energy drinks in educational establishments; and Turkey prohibits the sale or
advertising of energy drinks in “collective consumption areas,” such as sports complexes, schools or
hospitals. In Mexico, the States of Tabasco and Oaxaca prohibit the sale of energy drinks to minors and
the consumption in schools; Colima prohibits the sale of energy drinks in private and public schools.
Other Latin American countries such as Chile and Brazil have been considering age and other sales
restrictions on energy drinks, as are other countries such as the United Kingdom (other than Scotland) and
Spain. Poland has introduced a far-reaching bill that would, among other measures, ban the sale of energy
drinks to persons under 18, ban advertising of energy drinks on television and radio between 6 am and 8
pm with very limited exceptions, ban online and billboard advertising for energy drinks, and effectively
ban the sale or distribution of non-energy drink products carrying energy drink branding. Similar rules
would not apply to coffee products that contain similar or higher levels of caffeine.
Excise Taxes on Energy Drinks. Legislation that would impose an excise tax on sweetened
beverages has been proposed in the U.S. Congress, in some state legislatures and by some local
governments, with excise taxes generally ranging between $0.01 and $0.02 per ounce of sweetened
beverage. Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction to pass such a measure, and a general tax of
$0.01 per ounce on certain sweetened drinks, including energy drinks, became effective on January 1,
2015. Other U.S. jurisdictions (including Albany, Oakland and San Francisco, California; Boulder,
Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Seattle, Washington, and Washington, DC) have passed similar
measures, some of which have been challenged in litigation. The imposition of such taxes on our products
would increase the cost of certain of our products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make
certain of our products less affordable. Excise taxes on sweetened beverages already are in effect in
certain foreign countries where we do business, such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South
Africa, Mexico and Colombia. Poland recently established a tax on drinks with added sugars, specifically
targeting beverages containing caffeine and taurine. Other countries are considering similar measures. In
addition, legislation has been proposed in certain jurisdictions that would specifically impose excise taxes
on energy drinks. For example, Kuwait is considering a proposal that would impose an excise tax on
energy drinks. Such targeted legislation has been passed in other countries. For instance, on January 1,
2020, a reform to a Mexican excise tax went into effect that expanded the definition of an “energy drink”
subject to this tax to include products with any amount of caffeine (the prior version of the tax required a
threshold of 20 milligrams of caffeine per 100 millimeters for the tax to be applicable) and “taurine or
glucuronolactone or thiamine and/or any other substance that produces similar stimulating effects.”
17Hungary has instituted an excise tax to which our products are subject. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates began
Table of Contents
applying a selective tax of 100% on energy drinks in 2017, Qatar and Oman began applying the tax in
2019, and there are indications that a similar measure may be enacted in Kuwait.
Limits on Caffeine Content. Legislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that
may be contained in beverages, including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have
prescribed limited caffeine content for beverages. For example, in Canada, the maximum amount of
caffeine cannot exceed 180 mg per single-serving container or per serving (500 ml) in the case of a multi-
serving container. We adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy® products that are
sold in Canada to address these regulations, although the majority of our products were unaffected. In
Europe, examples of caffeine restrictions include the Netherlands where there is a limit of 35mg/100ml,
and Norway introduced, as of January 1, 2020 (subject to transition periods), a limit of 32mg/100ml.
Caffeine limit restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients or in particular
product sectors (such as performance beverages/sport drinks) have also been implemented or proposed in
other jurisdictions, including Turkey, India, Pakistan’s Punjab region, Egypt, Spain, Colombia, Iraq, and
the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Such restrictions could require reformulations of
certain of our products. However, we may not be able to satisfactorily reformulate our products in all
jurisdictions that adopt similar legislation.
Limitations on Container Size. We package our products in a variety of different package types
and sizes including, for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, aluminum cans larger than
16 fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, the Dominican Republic, and
Spain, have considered container size limitations on energy drinks and other beverages. If adopted, such
limitations may require us to change the container size of our products sold in certain countries. Other
countries, like England, have considered and rejected proposed can size limitations although it is open to
such markets to revisit these and other similar proposals.
Compliance with Alcohol-Related Regulation and Laws. Our Alcohol Brands segment is regulated
by federal, state and local governments in both the U.S. and abroad whose laws and regulations govern
the production, distribution and sale of alcohol beverages, including licensing, permitting, advertising and
marketing. To operate our breweries, manufacturing facilities and other alcohol-related facilities, as well
as to sell our alcohol products, we must obtain and maintain numerous approvals, licenses and permits
from governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Alcohol
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the FDA, state alcohol
regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. Our breweries, in particular, are subject
to audits and inspections by TTB and applicable state alcohol regulatory agencies at any time.
Our alcohol beverages are also subject to various taxes, license fees, and the like levied by
governmental entities as well as bonds that such entities may deem necessary to ensure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. One such tax that we must comply with is the federal excise taxes.
Beginning in January 2018, the federal excise taxes imposed on domestic brewers that produce less than 2
million barrels annually were reduced from $7.00 to $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped
annually. State and local excise taxes, on the other hand, vary based on the alcohol content and type of
beverage. Federal, state, or local governments may increase such excise taxes in the future.
Compliance with Environmental Laws. Our facilities and those of our co-packers in the United
States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating
to air emissions, water discharges, the use of water resources, waste disposal, and recycling. Our
operations in other countries are subject to similar federal, state, local and supranational laws and
regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Changes in environmental compliance mandates, and
any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial
performance and future growth. In addition, continuing concern over environmental matters, including
climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in
and outside of the United States), including to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases,
to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, or to
expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Compliance with
these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon
our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Container Deposits. Various municipalities, states and foreign countries require that a deposit be
charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these
measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship proposals
have been, and may in the future be, introduced and enacted at the federal, state, and local levels, and in
foreign countries.
In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such
redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based
upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain
other states and countries where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our
customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and
bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we have employees in 72 countries, with a total of 5,296 employees
working worldwide. This employee population includes 3,611 employees in North America, 367
employees in Latin America, 275 employees in Asia Pacific and 1,043 employees in Europe, Mideast and
Africa (“EMEA”). Most of our employees are full-time (4,607 employees) and the remaining 689
employees hold part-time positions. Of our 5,296 employees, we employ 1,923 in corporate and
operational capacities (including administration, human resources, legal, information technology,
operations, facilities, warehouse, product development, regulatory and accounting) and 3,373 persons in
sales and marketing capacities.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 43% of our U.S. employees are from one or more
underrepresented groups, including, but not limited to, Black, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native
American and other Indigenous tribes and approximately 36% of our U.S. employees are female.
In 2020, we established our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Leadership Advisory Group,
comprised of leaders from across the Company, designed to provide insight on our diversity and inclusion
efforts and to assist in the integration of the EDI program within our overall strategy and business
objectives. In 2021, we established three regional EDI Working Councils across the Americas, EMEA,
and APAC regions. We provide training for our employees covering harassment, discrimination and
unconscious bias.
We support our employees through a variety of training, mentorship and development programs.
We have a mid-level manager development program, in which participants learn leadership skills, network
with peers and senior executives, and tackle critical initiatives. We also have a leadership development
platform in partnership with a third party, for senior leaders to receive university grade certificates in
business strategy and innovation and complete Food and Beverage Executive courses, as well as an
electronic learning platform that focuses on business acumen, professional development and technical
capabilities. In addition, we provide employees with access to an e-learning platform that offers courses
focused on job and career training, business acumen, professional development and technical capabilities.
We provide compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent while maintaining
alignment with market compensation surveys. We have multiple short-term incentive programs focused
on incentivizing and retaining talent throughout the organization and provide long-term incentive
programs to employees through equity and/or performance cash awards.
We currently cover the cost of insurance premiums including medical (including virtual visits),
dental, vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment and short and long term disability, covering full-
time employees and share in the cost of insurance premiums covering eligible dependents including
medical, dental and vision coverage. We also offer several voluntary benefits to full-time employees,
including supplemental life insurance, whole life insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance,

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the
consolidated financial statements and related notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. If
any of the following risks actually occur or continue to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition
and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. The risk factors summarized below are not
the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition
and/or operating results.
Risk Factors Summary
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. You should read this summary together
with the more detailed description of each risk contained below.
Operational and Industry Risks
●The Company and TCCC have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the
Company’s future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with
TCCC.
●Provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders or TCCC may prevent
changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.
●We rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to
maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to
manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.
●We rely on our breweries for production of certain of our alcohol beverages, and developments
negatively affecting production at such facilities could materially impact the financial results of
our Alcohol Brands segment.
Table of Contents
21●We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and
distributors, our business could suffer.
●We currently derive most of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the
energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results.
●Criticism of our beverages and/or criticism or a negative perception of our products generally
could adversely affect us.
●Increased competition in the beverage industry and changing retail landscape could hurt our
business.
●Our inability to implement our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and
new sectors, such as the alcohol beverage sector, or successfully integrate acquired businesses or
assets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
●Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for our products.
●Our continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and
other risks in international markets.
●If we are not able to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials, including aluminum cans,
ingredients, fuel and/or costs of co-packing or if we experience shortages of such raw materials,
our business and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected and result in a
higher cost base.
●Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products or maintain sufficient inventory levels
could adversely affect our business and financial results.
●Our business is subject to seasonality, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results.
●The costs of packaging supplies, ocean and domestic freight, and inflation generally may
adversely affect our results of operations.
●Global or regional catastrophic events, such as the military conflict in Ukraine, could impact our
operations and affect our ability to grow our business.
●The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business and operations.
●Failure to meet sustainability expectations or standards could expose us to increased costs,
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences.
●Climate change and natural disasters may negatively affect our business.
●If we are not able to retain the services of our workforce, there may be an adverse effect on our
operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements.
●Negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate
reputation, and may cause our business to suffer.
Government Regulation and Litigation Risks
●Changes in government regulation, or a failure to comply with existing regulations, related to
energy drinks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
●Regulations concerning our alcohol beverages may adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations and inhibit the sales of such products.
●Significant changes to or failure to comply with various environmental laws may expose us to
liability and/or cause certain of our facilities and/or those of our co-packers to close, relocate or
operate at reduced production levels, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
●We cannot predict the effect of possible inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other
government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising,
marketing, promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our products.
Table of Contents
22●Litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to
significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products, thus negatively affecting our financial
results.
●If we encounter material product recalls, our business may suffer material losses and such recalls
could damage our brand image and corporate reputation, also resulting in material losses.
Intellectual Property, Information Technology and Data Privacy Risks
●Our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could
materially adversely affect our business.
●We must continually maintain, monitor, protect and/or upgrade our information technology
systems, including protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats.
Financial Risks
●Fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
●We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or
intangible assets become impaired.
●Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.
●Uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political
conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our
industry, business and results of operations.
●Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to
incur significant losses.
●Our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these
investments.
Operational and Industry Risks
The Company and TCCC have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the Company’s future
performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with TCCC.
We have transitioned all third parties’ rights to distribute the Company’s energy drink products in
the U.S. to members of TCCC’s distribution network, which largely consists of independent
bottlers/distributors. In addition, except for a handful of countries, TCCC is our preferred distribution
partner globally, with members of TCCC’s network distributing our products internationally, including in
Africa, Asia, Canada, Central and South America, Europe, Mexico and the Middle East. We expect
TCCC’s distribution network to continue as our preferred distribution partner globally. As a result, we
have reduced our distributor diversification and are now dependent on TCCC’s domestic and international
distribution platforms.
TCCC has a substantial equity investment in the Company. The Company, TCCC and certain
affiliates are parties to various agreements in which TCCC and certain affiliates have agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category in certain territories prior to the
termination of the applicable distribution coordination agreement with TCCC. The Company’s
distribution agreements with TCCC distributors also provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the
applicable distributor will not distribute competitive energy drink products.
Table of Contents
While we believe that these agreements incentivize TCCC to take steps to ensure that our
products receive the appropriate attention in the TCCC distribution system, disagreements as to the
interpretation of the provisions in such agreements have arisen and may arise in the future. In addition,
TCCC does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies
that make their own business decisions that may not always align with TCCC’s interests.
Provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders or TCCC may prevent changes in
control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.
Our organizational documents may limit changes in control. Furthermore, as of February 16,
2023, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting
control over approximately 9.3% of our outstanding common stock. As of February 16, 2023, TCCC
owned approximately 19.5% of our common stock. TCCC has also nominated one director to the
Company’s board of directors. Consequently, Mr. Sacks, Mr. Schlosberg and/or TCCC could exercise
significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors,
amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover
attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.
In particular, TCCC’s ownership could have an effect on the Company’s ability to engage in a
change in control transaction. TCCC is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of
the Company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common
shares not owned by TCCC with respect to a proposal for a change of control. However, if TCCC were to
oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders
of at least 62.5% of the Company’s common shares not owned by TCCC (assuming that TCCC increased
its ownership to 20% of the Company’s common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the Company’s
outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. In addition, TCCC would have a bidding
advantage if the Company’s board of directors were to seek to sell the Company in the future because
TCCC would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. TCCC and the
Company would also be permitted to terminate TCCC’s distribution coordination agreements with the
Company after a change in control of the Company. In such event, TCCC would receive a termination fee
if TCCC terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the
Company involving certain TCCC competitors, or if the Company terminated following a change in
control of the Company involving any third-party.
The interests of TCCC may be different from or conflict with the interests of the Company’s other
stockholders and, as a result, TCCC’s influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions
or transactions. Moreover, TCCC’s ownership of a significant amount of the Company’s outstanding
common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the Company’s common shares
if TCCC were to sell a large portion of its shares or as a result of the perception that such a sale might
occur.
We rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain
good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products
becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.
Our acquisition of AFF in 2016 brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of
our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. However, we also procure flavors from other independent
flavor suppliers. In 2022, we continued to outsource manufacturing of our non-alcohol finished goods to
bottlers and other contract packers. As a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay, and/or demand
exceeding forecasted demand, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially
reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. In addition, there are limited alternative
packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable
equipment for many of our products. For example, in 2022, sales of many of our product lines continued
to be adversely impacted by production capacity constraints as a result of above forecast demand. A
lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of our products could significantly adversely affect,
and has adversely affected, our revenues from and/or costs of such products, because alternative co-
packing facilities in the United States and abroad with adequate long-
23
Table of Contents
term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs
and/or within a reasonably short time period and/or within a geographically cost effective distance, if at
all. In addition, in recent years, there has been a consolidation of co-packers, leading us to increasingly
rely on fewer co-packing groups, certain of which account for a large percentage of our co-packing
capacity for our Monster Energy® drinks. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our largest
co-packers, or if our costs of co-packing increase, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.
We rely on our breweries for production of our alcohol beverages, and developments negatively affecting
production at such facilities could materially impact the financial results of our Alcohol Brands segment.
We are currently dependent on CANarchy’s portfolio of craft breweries, which includes Oskar
Blues Brewery, Cigar City Brewing, Squatters Craft Beers, Wasatch Brewery, Deep Ellum Brewing
Company, and Perrin Brewing Company, to manufacture our alcohol products. Adverse changes or
developments affecting our currently limited number of breweries could hinder our ability to produce
alcohol products to take to market on a timely basis or require us to entirely suspend our Alcohol Brands
segment operations. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be readily
available or may take significant time or money to run at the same capacity as our current breweries. Such
significant disruption may, in turn, have an adverse effect on gross margins, operating cash flows, and
overall financial performance of our Alcohol Brands segment.
We rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. If we are unable to maintain good
relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our
business could suffer.
Many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other
carbonated, non-carbonated, non-alcohol, alcohol and other beverage products. In many cases, such
products compete directly with our products.
Unilateral decisions by bottlers/distributors, buying groups, convenience chains, grocery chains,
mass merchandisers, specialty chain stores, club stores, e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites and
other customers, including retailer disagreements with our bottlers/distributors, to discontinue carrying all
or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, restrict the range of our products they carry,
impose restrictions or limitations on the sale of our products and/or the sizes of containers of our products
and/or devote less resources to the sale of our products could cause our business to suffer. Moreover,
competitors’ or others’ attempts to persuade regulators, retailers, and/or customers in certain countries to
reduce the permitted or maximum container sizes for our products from those currently being sold and
marketed by us could negatively impact our business. In addition, possible trading disputes between our
bottler/distributors and their customers or buying groups may result in the delisting of certain of the
Company’s products, temporarily or otherwise. Bottler/distributor consolidation may also have an impact
on our business.
The TCCC North American Bottlers, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-
Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola (China), COFCO Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Beverages
Africa and Coca-Cola İçecek are our primary domestic and international distributors of our non-alcohol
products. We also sell our alcohol beverages to certain beer distributors through generally separate
distribution networks for distribution to retailers. As a result, if we are unable to maintain good
relationships with these bottlers/distributors, if changes in control or ownership occur within the current
distribution network, or if they do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing
our products, sales of our products could be adversely affected.
A decision by any large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying
our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of
operations.
The marketing efforts of our bottlers/distributors are important for our success. If our brands
prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers
and distributors, and/or our
24
Table of Contents
bottlers/distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Disruption in distribution channels and/or a decline in sales due to the termination and/or
insolvency of existing or new bottlers/distributors may adversely affect our business and operating results.
No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our current distribution network or
secure additional distributors on terms not less favorable to us than our current arrangements.
We currently derive most of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink
category could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes
impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the
trading price of our common stock.
Most of our sales are currently derived from our energy drinks, including our Monster Energy®
brand energy drinks, our Reign Total Body Fuel® energy drinks and our Strategic Brands energy drinks
(including our affordable brand energy drinks, principally Predator®). Any decrease in the sales of our
Monster Energy® brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues
and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the
energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. For a discussion of such competition, see
“Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition.”
The increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space in retail stores,
including in beverage coolers, may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in
the marketplace. In addition, certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or
misleading claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as
competitors selling misbranded products, could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the energy
drink category could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Criticism of our beverages and/or criticism or a negative perception of our products generally could
adversely affect us.
An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, other ingredients in energy drinks or
energy drinks generally, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other
ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, including product safety concerns, could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Articles critical of the
caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of
energy drinks have been published in recent years. We believe the overall growth of the energy drink
market in the U.S. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments
that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on
their ingredients (including caffeine), and/or the levels thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions
for consumers. In early 2018, certain retailers in the United Kingdom announced the introduction of
voluntary retailer measures to prevent the sale of energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. If
reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are
published in the future, or additional voluntary measures are taken, they could adversely affect the
demand for our products. If we are unable to satisfy all criteria set forth in any model energy drink
guidelines, including, without limitation, those adopted by the American Beverage Association, of which
we are a member, and/or any international beverage associations, it could negatively affect our overall
reputation, which in turn could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
The alcohol beverage industry has also been the subject of considerable societal and political
attention for many years due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related health and social issues,
including driving under the influence, underage drinking, and the negative health impacts of the misuse or
25abuse of alcohol. Moreover, anti-alcohol groups have successfully advocated, and increasingly continue to
advocate, for more stringent labeling requirements, higher taxes, and
Table of Contents
26other regulations designed to curtail alcohol consumption. In response to these concerns and advocacy,
advertising by alcohol producers could be further restricted, additional, cautionary labeling or packaging
requirements might be imposed, further restrictions on the sale of alcohol might be imposed, or there may
be renewed efforts to impose increased excise or other taxes on alcohol sold in the United States or
abroad. In addition, the increase of such criticism and negative perception of the relative healthfulness or
safety of alcohol beverages could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol, including the demand for
our alcohol products. Any such developments may have a negative impact on the operating results of our
Alcohol Brands segment.
Increased competition in the beverage industry and changing retail landscape could hurt our business.
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing,
packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning, quality as well as promotion and
marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks, both non-alcohol and alcohol,
produced by a relatively large number of domestic and international manufacturers, some of which have
substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the efficacy, taste and
flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and
unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing.
The success of our sports marketing, social media and other general marketing endeavors may impact our
business, financial condition and results of operation. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments
and in some cases with products of much larger competitors, including the products of numerous
nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Red Bull GmbH, KDP, Molson
Coors, Constellation Brands, AB InBev, The Boston Beer Company and The Mark Anthony Group. We
also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations, such as
CELSIUS, PRIME, C4, Alani Nu, Bang, GHOST, and others as well as local craft breweries in our
Alcohol Brands segment. Our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by
grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.
We anticipate competition will remain robust as some competitors are consolidating (as evidenced
by business combinations of substantial value carried out by significant competitors in recent years),
building more capacity, expanding geographically, and/or adding more SKUs and styles. For example,
PepsiCo entered into a long-term strategic distribution arrangement with Celsius Holdings, Inc., a
competitor in the energy drink space, in August 2022. Additionally, the number of competitors, especially
craft brewers and craft distilleries, within the alcohol space and the sales of hard seltzers, FMBs, craft-
brewed domestic beers, imported beers, CBD and other cannabis beverages, and ready-to-drink spirits are
expected to increase, particularly following the U.S. Treasury Report, “Competition in the Market for
Beer, Wine and Spirits” (the “Treasury Report”) which promises to evaluate the impact of consolidation
on marketplace competition. As a result of such increased competition for our products, we may face
competitive pricing pressures and the demand for and market share of our products may fluctuate and
possibly decline.
Table of Contents
The rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce
applications and subscription services, and closures of physical retail operations, particularly during and
following the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital
channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. As we build our e-commerce capabilities, we may not be
able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without
experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If
we are unable to profitably expand our own e-commerce capabilities and/or if e-commerce retailers take
significant market share away from traditional retailers our business may be adversely affected. Further,
the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional
pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. Sales in gas chains may also be affected by increased
gasoline prices, improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric or
alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a
corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. If we are unable to
successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall
financial results could be negatively affected.
Due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter
difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. If our
revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our inability to implement our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and new
sectors, such as the alcohol beverage sector, or to successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets
could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business
growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The
success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to
consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial
condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.
On February 17, 2022, we acquired CANarchy, a craft beer and hard seltzer company and may
continue to make acquisitions that expand our business into new sectors in the beverage industry. Risks
associated with entering into a new sector include: (1) having no or limited experience in such sector; (2)
increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements; (3) difficulties
developing, manufacturing, and marketing the products of newly acquired companies; and (4) our lesser
familiarity with consumer preferences in the new sector. Entry into new sectors of the beverage industry
may bring us into competition with new competitors that have potentially a larger, more established
market presence. We cannot ensure that our entry into the alcohol beverage sector or any other new
beverage sectors will be profitable and future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially
adversely affected.
Overall, the effectiveness of these acquisitions can be less predictable than developing new lines
of energy drinks and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. Integrating the
operations of acquired businesses could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a
number of risks including, but not limited to, the integration of company cultures and management teams,
retaining key employees and customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and
compliance requirements, increased costs, and use of resources. To the extent we integrate acquired
businesses, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition
over the timeframe we expect, or at all, or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a
result of acquisitions. The costs of achieving these benefits could also be higher than we expected.
Therefore, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as
expected, we may not achieve profit margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the
other anticipated strategic financial benefits of such transactions.
Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for our products.
The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer
preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness
27and nutrition considerations, including
Table of Contents
28concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened beverages, the perceived undesirability
of artificial ingredients, and the potential adverse consequences from excess consumption of alcohol
beverages. Some consumer advocacy groups and others have expressed concerns regarding certain
ingredients in diet sodas, which are contained in certain of our energy drinks, or have called for the
curtailment of alcohol dissemination and consumption. There are also changes in demand for different
packages, sizes and configurations. Such developments could reduce our revenues and adversely affect
our results of operations.
Consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. For example, with regard to our Alcohol
Brands, the broader alcohol industry is experiencing a shift in drinking preferences and behaviors, moving
away from traditionally popular beer brands and segments and towards above premium beers, hard
seltzers, FMBs, ready-to-drink malt-based, sugar-based, and spirits-based beverages, CBD and other
cannabis beverages, and other similar beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our
continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers.
In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce
different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of efficacy, taste, quality and price,
although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will
continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products
and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change. The beverages we
currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such
beverages will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through
product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as
shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with customers embracing shopping by way
of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be
unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences or engage with our customers
on their preferred platforms. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.
Our continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks
in international markets.
We have continued expanding our energy drink operations internationally into a variety of new
markets. Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 37%, 37% and 33%
of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As our
growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to
expand distribution of our products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected.
In many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some international markets
we have no operating experience. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations
and develop and promote our brands in international markets. Our percentage gross profit margins in
many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins
obtained in the United States. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having
foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets;
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of
foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any
repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our
ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, our operations outside
of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher
product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of
fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax
consequences.

If we are not able to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials, including aluminum cans,
ingredients, fuel and/or costs of co-packing, or if we experience shortages of such raw materials, our
business and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected and result in a higher cost base.
The principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap
cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, aluminum or steel kegs, cartons, PET plastic bottles, caps,
flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, coffee, tea, cocoa, malted barley, hops,
water, yeast, ethanol, supplement ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs and availability of
which are subject to fluctuations. For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a
limited number of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks,
these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not
have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our
products and certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or
concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers generally do not
make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third-party customers. We have
identified alternative suppliers for certain of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages.
However, industry-wide shortages of certain flavor ingredients, flavors, fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea,
cocoa, dairy-based products, packaging materials (including aluminum cans) supplement ingredients and
sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere
with and/or delay production of certain of our products. In addition, certain of our co-packing
arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their fees based on certain of their own cost increases. We
are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, many of
which have recently risen significantly, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. We are unsure
whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. Although we generally do not
use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient
ingredients or raw materials, from time to time, we, through our aluminum can suppliers, enter into
purchase agreements for the purchase of aluminum, as well as enter into purchase agreements for portions
of our annual anticipated requirements for certain of our other raw materials such as glucose, sugar and
sucralose. In recent years, the United States has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on
goods imported from certain countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range
of imports, or further trade measures taken by other countries, could result in an increase in supply chain
costs.
Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products or maintain sufficient inventory levels could
adversely affect our business and financial results.
We may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability
to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be
less precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially underestimate
demand for our products, and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients, raw materials and/or
packaging materials, or experience production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy
demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates,
supplement ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be
experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. We generally do not use
hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with
and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial results.
If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will
take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be
negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with
distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed
or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate
inventory levels of the requisite products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or
retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact
our future sales and adversely affect our operating results.

Table of Contents
Our business is subject to seasonality, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results.
Our business is subject to seasonality, which may cause the sale of our products to fluctuate from
period to period due to the inherent demands and timing of our customers and consumer needs as well as
seasonal factors, such as poor weather conditions. Given such variation by season, our results for any
particular quarter may not be indicative of the results to be achieved for the entire fiscal year.
The costs of packaging supplies, ocean and domestic freight, and inflation generally may adversely affect
our results of operations.
Many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for
packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce
those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, PET plastic for bottles and pulp and paper for
cartons and/or trays. These changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain
predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. In some cases, we are able to fix the prices of
certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. In other cases, we bear the risk of
increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that
comprise these packaging supplies. We do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. Recently,
inflation has affected, and continues to affect certain of our raw material and packaging costs,
commodities and other inputs globally. If the costs of packaging supplies and other costs, such as shipping
container costs and ocean and domestic freight rates, increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along
to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.
Global or regional catastrophic events, such as the military conflict in Ukraine, could impact our
operations and affect our ability to grow our business.
Because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political
conditions, civil unrest, protests and demonstrations, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed
against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the
outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities (such as the military conflict in Ukraine), major natural
disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornados, earthquakes or floods,
or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Such catastrophic
events could impact our operations and our supply chain, including the production and/or distribution of
our products. Materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a
large part of our operations are located in California, a state at greater risk for earthquakes and wildfires.
Some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers,
and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations. In
addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer
purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our
products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors,
our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business and operations.
The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented and may continue to present a substantial public
health and economic challenge in certain countries and has affected, and may continue to affect, our
employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets.
The human and economic consequences, and consequences in general, of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including new variants, as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments,
businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers and other service
providers) and the public at large to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, have and will directly and indirectly
impact our business and results of operations. In China, in particular, COVID-19 policies, including
certain lockdowns in 2022, adversely affected sales in the region and may continue to have an impact on
our financial results in such country.

Table of Contents
The negative impacts and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse
effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition and could exacerbate many
of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation,
operating results and/or financial condition.
Failure to meet sustainability expectations or standards could expose us to increased costs, reputational
harm, or other adverse consequences.
Regulators and stakeholders are increasingly focusing on sustainability matters, including, but not
limited to,  greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related risks, sustainable packaging, water
stewardship, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and corporate governance and oversight. While we are
actively addressing these issues and have publicly committed to setting certain sustainability -related
targets, these initiatives are our current plans and aspirations, may be refined in the future, and are not
guarantees that we will be able to achieve them, especially given the difficulties and expenses of
implementation as well as the ever-changing regulatory and technological landscape. For example,
disclosures about our sustainability -related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be
based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that
continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Furthermore, the rules,
regulations, and standards set forth by various governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including
the SEC, the European Commission, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, continue to evolve in
scope and complexity, which, in turn, makes compliance more uncertain and difficult. These changing
rules and regulations, along with constantly evolving stockholder expectations, have resulted in, and may
continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and
attention spent complying with or meeting such expectations and rules.
Our failure or perceived failure to progress or achieve our sustainability goals, maintain
sustainability practices, or comply with emerging sustainability regulations that meet developing
regulatory or stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation, harm our ability to maintain or attract
customers and talent, and expose us to increased scrutiny from enforcement authorities and stakeholders.
Our reputation may also be harmed by the perceptions that our stakeholders have about our action or
inaction on sustainability-related issues as well as the nature or scope of, or revisions to, our sustainability
initiatives and goals. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our
products and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional
resources to rebuild our reputation and could also reduce our stock price.
Climate change and natural disasters may affect our business.
There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns
around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather
patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases
or other health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients,
juice concentrates, supplements and other ingredients used in our products and could impact the food
security of communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions
could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact demand for our
products.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or
floods, and outbreaks of diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other health issues may affect our
operations and the operation of our supply chain, impact the operations of our bottlers/distributors and
unfavorably impact our consumers’ ability to purchase our products.
The predicted effects of climate change may also result in challenges regarding availability and
quality of water, or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our business and results
of operations. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in
increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional
investments in facilities and equipment. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, standards or practices
related to greenhouse gas emissions, packaging and water scarcity, as well as initiatives
31
Table of Contents
32by advocacy groups in favor of certain climate change-related laws, regulations, standards or practices,
may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations, which
could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, last year, the SEC
and, subsequently, the European Commission published proposed rules that, if adopted, would require
companies to significantly increase their disclosures related to climate change and mitigation efforts,
which may require us to incur additional costs to comply and impose more oversight obligations on our
Board of Directors and management. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by
weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. We, our bottlers and our contract packers, use a
number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our beverage products that are derived from agricultural
commodities, such as sugar, ethanol, coffee, tea cocoa, barley and hops. Increased demand for food
products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing
weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural
commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Weather conditions
may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an effect on our
operations, either positively or negatively.
If we are not able to retain the services of our workforce, there may be an adverse effect on our operations
and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements.
Our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our workforce. We do not
maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. The loss of services of
either Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Hilton Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and
Co-Chief Executive Officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect
our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of personnel with
the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified
personnel on acceptable terms.
Negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate reputation,
and may cause our business to suffer.
Our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing
products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no
assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product
safety and quality, human rights and environmental sustainability will have the desired impact on our
products’ brand image and on consumer preferences and demand. Claims regarding product safety, quality
and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), our culture and our
workforce, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, or allegations of product
contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause
consumers to choose other products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if
we, our employees, bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our
products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially
irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and
treatment of our customers, or the use of customer data. Furthermore, our brand image or perceived
product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or
elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether
involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting the
beverage industry, whether related to alcohol or non-alcohol beverages. Negative postings or comments
on social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands, even if inaccurate
or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the
Company. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our
bottlers/distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce
brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on consumer
demand for our products as well as our reputation and financial results. The impact of such incidents may
be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media
(including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation.
Table of Contents
33In addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to
our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the
subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse
media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could
subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities
associated with organizations we sponsor or support. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or
our supply chain, with human and workplace rights, environmental or animal rights issues could adversely
impact our corporate image and reputation. We have made a number of commitments to respect human
rights, including the policies and initiatives described in our California Transparency in Supply Chains
Act & United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act statement. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not
respecting the human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual
or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and
workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant
workers; adverse publicity surrounding obesity, alcohol consumption, including alcoholism and drunk
driving, and other such health concerns related to our products, water usage, our environmental impact
and the sustainability of our operations, labor relations, our culture and our workforce or the like could
negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative
impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers.
Government Regulation and Litigation Risks
Changes in government regulation, or a failure to comply with existing regulations related to energy
drinks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level and
proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including,
prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental
programs), limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages, require certain product
labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age restrictions for
the sale of energy drinks. For a discussion of certain of such legislation, see “Part I, Item 1 – Business –
Government Regulation.” Furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the United States and
other countries at the federal, state, local, municipal and supranational level in respect of each of the
foregoing subject areas. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public
health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative
change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been increased focus on
caffeine content in beverages, and we are seeing some attention to other ingredients in energy drinks. To
the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our
products are sold, individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for, or
availability of, our energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are also
currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the FD&C Act; the
Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; data privacy laws; California
Proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the
production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling, packaging and ingredients of such products.
Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also
subject to numerous statutes and regulations.
If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product, its label, or a production run is not
in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or the products in question may have to be
recalled, removed from the market, reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Table of Contents
Regulations concerning our alcohol beverages may adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations and inhibit the sales of such products.
Governmental agencies heavily regulate the alcohol beverage industry. In particular, they monitor
and regulate licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling,
including warning labels, signage, advertising, relations with wholesalers and retailers, and, in control
states, product listings. Increased regulatory trade practice enforcement may increase in response to the
Treasury Report. There may also be a focus on companies with established non-alcohol beverages lines of
business that have expanded into the alcohol beverage industry, since marketing practices that are
acceptable in the non-alcohol space may have regulatory challenges in the alcohol space. In addition,
other countries in which we may sell alcohol beverages could impose duties, excise taxes and/or other
related taxes. If, in the future, we are unable to comply with certain regulations, sales of our products
could decrease significantly. Additionally, if such agencies or jurisdictions, foreign or domestic, choose to
implement new or revised laws, regulations, fees, taxes, or other such requirements, our business could be
adversely affected. If such governmental bodies require increased additional product labeling, warning
requirements, or limitations on the marketing or sale of our alcohol products due to their contents or
allegations concerning their potential to cause adverse health effects, our sales of alcohol beverages may
be adversely affected.
Significant changes to or failure to comply with various environmental laws may expose us to liability
and/or cause certain of our facilities and/or those of our co-packers to close, relocate or operate at
reduced production levels, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
We, and our co-packers, are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state,
regional, local, and international environmental laws, including statutes and regulations, which aim to
regulate emissions and impacts to air, land, and water. Our operations and those of our co-packers may
result in odors, noise, or other pollutants being emitted. Failure to comply with any environmental laws or
any future changes to them could result in alleged harm to employees or others near our facilities or those
of our co-packers. Significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory
requirements, or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or
courts may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Increasing concern over sustainability matters, including climate change, will likely result in new
or revised laws and regulations aimed at reducing or mitigating the potential effects of greenhouse gases,
restricting or increasing the costs of commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, or
increasing mandatory reporting of certain sustainability metrics, such as recycling. If we fail to comply
with applicable environmental compliance mandates or fail to meet sustainability metrics, our business
operations and our reputation could be adversely impacted.
We cannot predict the effect of possible inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other
government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing,
promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our products.
We are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general
and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing,
promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our products, and we are a party, from time to time, to various
government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings. Defending these proceedings can result in
significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management’s time and attention from the
operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations.
In addition, from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate
the safety of caffeine and other ingredients in energy drinks as well as the safety and potential adverse
effects of alcohol beverages. If an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-
government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients,
usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may
become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or
34
Table of Contents
sale of our products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant
liabilities and reduce demand for our products, thus negatively affecting our financial results.
We have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal
proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false
advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, claims from prior distributors, labor and
employment matters, personal injury matters, consumer class actions, securities actions and shareholder
derivative actions.
Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our
advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in
compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that our products are not safe. Putative class
action lawsuits have also been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their
advertisements amount to false advertising. We do not believe any statements made by us in our
promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local
law, or that our products are in any way unsafe, and we vigorously defend such lawsuits.
Our acquisition of CANarchy also exposes us to class action or other private or governmental
litigation and claims relating to alcohol marketing, advertising, or distribution practices, alcohol abuse
problems or other health consequences arising from excessive consumption of or other misuse of alcohol,
including death. For example, in a number of states, plaintiffs have alleged that alcohol beverage
manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted underage consumers in their advertising in
violation of the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes of certain states.
Any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention
arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and
managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards
against us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. Our failure to
successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent
not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and
profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
If we encounter material product recalls, our business may suffer material losses and such recalls could
damage our brand image and corporate reputation, also resulting in material losses.
We may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers,
markets, retailers or batches or reformulate certain of our products if such products become contaminated,
damaged, mislabeled, defective or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory
requirements. A material product recall could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image and
corporate reputation. We do not maintain recall insurance.
Intellectual Property, Information Technology and Data Privacy Risks
Our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially
adversely affect our business.
We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. We also own the copyright
in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. We regard our trademarks, copyrights
and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property
through registration and enforcement actions. However, there can be no assurance that other parties will
not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. We also have
been, and may in the future be, unable to use our trademarks, trade names or designs and/or trade dress in
certain countries, which may impact sales of the affected brands and require increased expenditures,
which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We must continually maintain, monitor, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems,
including protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats.
Information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain
financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not
appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper
technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of
customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security
breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving, may be
difficult to detect for periods of time, and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware,
ransomware and viruses), phishing and social engineering, attempts to gain unauthorized access to
networks, computer systems and data, malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of
information they are entitled to access), cyber extortion, electronic or wire fraud, and other forms of
electronic security breaches. Such attacks could lead to disruptions in or loss of access to our data or
business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized
release of confidential or otherwise protected information, lost revenues or other costs due to office, plant,
warehouse or other facility disruption or shutdown, and corruption of data.
We rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, bottlers, contract
packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other
external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-
party service providers and partners, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar risks as we are
relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee
failures. While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party
service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or
governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal,
reputational and operational risk. These third parties may experience cybersecurity incidents that may
involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us, and the need to coordinate with such
third-parties, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information
concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise.
However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could
potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure.
Moreover, if our data management systems, including our SAP enterprise resource planning
system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business
(whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or
human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with
applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could
materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness
with which we report our internal and external operating results.
If we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse
publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our
business and operating results.
We receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable
individuals (“personal data”), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business.
As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to
personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other
jurisdictions at any time. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
became effective in May 2018 for all member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for
companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the European Union different from those
that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into
effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data
breaches and imposes operational requirements on companies that process personal data of California
36residents, including making new disclosures to consumers about data collection, processing and sharing
practices and allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.
Table of Contents
Changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as other changes to existing personal
data protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, subject the Company to,
among other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business
practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. There can be no assurances that our
security controls over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor
management processes, and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the
improper processing or breaches of personal data. Data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of
personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws
and regulations, could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government
enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which may result in
potential loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal
prosecution, thereby negatively impacting our business and operating results.
Financial Risks
Fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions.
Therefore, we are subject to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once.
We are in various stages of examination with certain states and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our
2019 through 2021 U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS. Our state
income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2018 through 2021 tax years.
At any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits
will be resolved and thus, there could be significant variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates,
because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions.
Changes in U.S. tax laws as a result of any legislation proposed by the new U.S. Presidential
Administration or U.S. Congress, which may include efforts to change or repeal the 2017 Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act and the federal corporate income tax rate reduction, could adversely affect our provision for
income taxes, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In
addition, changes in the manner in which U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings,
including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our
financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (“OECD”) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax
principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project. These changes, to the extent
adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision
for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. In connection with the OECD’s BEPS project,
companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world,
which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political
pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or
reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final
resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals,
resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible
assets become impaired.
Under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we are required to
review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that
the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than
anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market
capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry.

Table of Contents
We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in
which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. Any such charge would adversely
impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill totaled approximately $1.42
billion and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.22 billion.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits,
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We enter into forward currency
exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a
portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-
functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. We have not used instruments to hedge against all
foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. As a result,
our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any
favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. The current relative strength of the U.S. dollar has impacted
our results of operations.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, aggregate foreign currency transaction
gains (losses), including the gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts, amounted to ($37.9)
million, $0.3 million and ($11.2) million, respectively.
Potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial
results.
We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have
on our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect
our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income.
Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage
containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our
products’ affordability and reduce our sales.
If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the Company could be
materially and adversely affected.
We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control
over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in “Part II, Item 9A – Controls and
Procedures.” If we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed.
Uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political
conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry,
business and results of operations.
Global economic uncertainties, including highly inflationary economies and foreign currency
exchange rates and rising interest rates, affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it
difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. There can be no assurance that
economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance
conditions in markets relevant to us. In addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of
disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our
expansion outside of the United States has increased our exposure to any developments or crises in
African, Asian, European and other international markets. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial
uncertainties in our major international markets, including economic slowdowns and recessions, and
unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other
international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing
power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Included in the foregoing are long-term uncertainties
38surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly
referred to as
Table of Contents
“Brexit”) and any resulting increases in tariffs, importation restrictions, out of stocks, volatility in
currency exchange rates, including the valuation of the euro and the British pound in particular, changes
in the laws and regulations applied in the United Kingdom or impacts on economic and market conditions
in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states and elsewhere. The foregoing also
includes the military conflict in Ukraine and any increased economic uncertainty and volatility in
commodity prices that it poses.
Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur
significant losses.
As part of any hedging activities that we may conduct, we may enter into transactions involving
derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option
contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. We also have significant amounts of cash,
cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions
both in the United States and abroad, exposing us to risk of default by or failure of such counterparty
financial institutions. This risk of counterparty default or failure is greater during periods of economic
downturn or uncertainty in financial markets. If one of our counterparties became insolvent or filed for
bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred due to the default or to retrieve assets deposited or held
in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or applicable laws
governing insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings. Default by or failure of one or more of our
counterparties could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations
and financial condition.
Volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities.
Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial
results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market
conditions such as inflation, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments
by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control.
We do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues,
margins, product mix, operating expenses, net income, or earnings per share. We may be unable to
achieve analysts’ net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues,
sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more
profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. There can
be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mix of product sales, revenues, gross
margins, operating profits, net income and/or earnings per share. As a result, our stock price is subject to
significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. In addition,
periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action
litigation against us. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the high of our stock price was
$104.65 and the low was $71.78.
Our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.
At December 31, 2022, we had $1.31 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.36 billion in short-
term investments and $61.4 million in long-term investments, including certificates of deposit,
commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. treasuries, and to a lesser extent, municipal
securities. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate
risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future
results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
As of February 16, 2023, our principal properties include our corporate headquarters as well as
our Southern California warehouse and distribution center.

Table of Contents
Our owned corporate facilities located in Corona, California, consist of (i) an approximately
141,000 square-foot, free-standing, six-story building (LEED Gold and ENERGY STAR certified), (ii) an
approximately 147,625 square-foot three-story parking structure and storage facility, which houses our
approximately 14,000 square-foot quality control laboratory, (iii) an approximately 75,426 square foot,
free-standing, three-story building (currently pursuing ENERGY STAR certification), (iv) an
approximately 20,661 square-foot, free-standing, single-story building and (v) an approximately 49,617
square-foot, free-standing, two-story building.
Our owned Southern California warehouse and distribution center is located in Rialto, California,
consisting of an approximately 1,000,000 square-foot building which is LEED certified.
During 2022, we acquired certain real property and equipment in Norwalk, California. We intend
to utilize the property as a manufacturing facility for certain of our products.
During 2020, we purchased a three-story office building located in Uxbridge, United Kingdom.
During 2019, we acquired a manufacturing plant and adjoining land in Athy, County Kildare,
Ireland to produce and supply ingredients, including flavors, for certain of our international markets.
During 2019, we purchased approximately 7.66 acres of land in San Fernando, California. We are
in the process of constructing a new production facility thereon to consolidate AFF’s operations into a
single location.
In addition, we lease many smaller office and/or warehouse/manufacturing spaces, both
domestically and in certain international locations.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time in the normal course of business, the Company is named in litigation, including
labor and employment matters, personal injury matters, consumer class actions, intellectual property
matters and claims from prior distributors. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of
such litigation, based on the facts known to the Company, management believes that such litigation in
aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations.
The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other
matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued, if any, and
any related insurance reimbursements. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no loss contingencies were
included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
On September 29, 2022, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the
“District Court”) awarded Monster Energy Company (“MEC”) approximately $293 million in damages in
its false advertising and trade secrets case against Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“VPX”), the maker of Bang
Energy. The jury found VPX and its chief executive officer to have falsely advertised the “Super
Creatine” ingredient of Bang Energy and to have acted willfully and deliberately in violating the federal
Lanham Act. The jury also found that VPX stole trade secrets and interfered with MEC’s  contracts over
shelf space with certain key vendors. The parties are currently briefing post-verdict issues, including
MEC’s motion for a permanent injunction relating to “Super Creatine” and request for enhanced and
punitive damages.
In April 2022, MEC and Orange Bang, Inc. (“Orange Bang”) filed a joint motion in the District
Court to confirm a final arbitration award against VPX that awarded MEC and Orange Bang $175.0
million and a 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX’s Bang Energy drink and other Bang-branded
products as well as certain fees and costs. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and
Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will, after accounting for MEC’s expended fees and costs, be
shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. The arbitration arose from a settlement agreement that
VPX entered into in 2010 with Orange Bang, a family-owned beverage business. Pursuant to the terms of
40that agreement, VPX is only permitted to use the Bang mark on “creatine-based” products or on Bang
products that are marketed and sold
Table of Contents
41only in the vitamin and dietary supplement sections of stores. On September 29, 2022, the District Court
entered final judgment confirming the award. On October 28, 2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal of the
District Court’s final judgment confirming the award.
On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Florida. Due to such
ongoing proceedings, VPX’s appeal of the District Court’s final judgment confirming the final arbitration
award is stayed. While reserving all rights to appeal, VPX made its first royalty payment of $3.6 million
on February 14, 2023, which is for sales of Bang Energy drinks and other Bang-branded products from
October 10, 2022 through December 31, 2022. This payment is subject to potential claw back if, among
other things, the judgment and final arbitration award are overturned on appeal or VPX becomes
administratively insolvent. In addition, per ASC 450 “Contingencies”, the Company will not recognize the
September 2022 jury award or April 2022 arbitration award until the awards are realized or realizable. As
of March 1, 2023, the proceedings have yet to progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for
an accurate timeline of when the awards, including any royalty payments received, will be realized or
realizable, if at all.

facilitates our entry into the alcohol beverage sector and brings the Cigar CityTM family of brands
including Jai Alai® IPA and Florida ManTM IPA, the Oskar BluesTM family of brands including Dale’s
Pale Ale®, Wild BasinTM Hard Seltzers, the Deep EllumTM family of brands including Dallas Blonde®
and Deep EllumTM IPA, the Perrin Brewing CompanyTM family of brands including Black Ale, the
Squatters® family of brands including Hop Rising® Double IPA, and the Wasatch® family of brands
including Apricot Hefeweizen to our beverage portfolio. The CANarchy Transaction did not include
CANarchy’s stand-alone restaurants. Our organizational structure for our existing energy beverage
business remains unchanged. CANarchy is functioning independently, retaining its own organizational
structure and team.

45Russia-Ukraine Conflict
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict did not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Net sales in Russia and Ukraine
combined were approximately 1.1% of our total net sales for the twelve months ended December 31,
2021. We will continue to monitor future developments relative to this conflict and its potential impacts.
The COVID – 19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business. The duration and
severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be
accurately predicted, including new information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the
emergence of new variants, the actions taken to limit its spread and the economic impact on local,
regional, national and international markets. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
Pricing Actions
In 2022, we implemented measures to mitigate our increased costs through price increases and
reductions in promotions (“Pricing Actions”). We implemented a price increase effective September 1,
2022 in the United States and implemented price increases at various times in certain international
markets, all of which positively impacted gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.
Distribution and Supply Chain
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for our
energy drinks, we prioritized ensuring product availability for our customers and consumers. This
strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions,
despite adversely impacting our profitability. We continue to stand by our strategy to ensure product
availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of our brands.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced a significant increase in cost of sales,
resulting in a material decrease in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales, relative to
the comparative year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to (i)
increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-
packing fees, (ii) increased logistical costs, (iii) increased aluminum can costs and (iv) geographical and
product sales mix.
In the third and fourth quarters of 2022 we began to see an improvement in our gross profit
margins as compared to the second quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily attributable to (i)
Pricing Actions, (ii) our decreased reliance on imported cans and (iii) improved finished product inventory
levels in closer proximity to our customers, resulting in a reduction of long-distance freight costs.
Furthermore, we experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of
increased warehousing expenses, as well as increases in other logistical expenses, which adversely
impacted operating costs.
We continue to address the controllable challenges in our supply chain.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of the date of this filing, we expect to maintain substantial liquidity as we manage through the
current environment as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.

Our net sales of $6.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 represented record annual net
sales. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of
approximately $239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. Our

0.4% and 0.5% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net sales of the
Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $222.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2022. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the
Strategic Brands segment of approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Our growth strategy includes further developing our domestic markets, expanding our
international business and growing our business into new sectors, such as the alcohol beverage sector. Net
sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $2.36 billion and $2.04 billion for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Such sales were

48Value Drivers of our Business
We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:
●International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our
brands internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of
our products are distributed in approximately 157 countries and territories worldwide.
●Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added beverage brands supported by
marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth.
We are focused on increasing the profit margins for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment,
our Strategic Brands segment and our Alcohol Brands segment, and believe that tailored
branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable
growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.
●Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on
mitigating increases and/or reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case
basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by
securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is
to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including
sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.
●Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital
in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our
strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective
cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for
accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.
We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these
value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in:
(1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) reducing our expenses as a percentage
of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and
will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.
Net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key
measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management
focus in 2023 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations”).
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of $3.76 billion compared to $3.72
billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the increase
in accounts receivable and inventories, related to the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31,
2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net cash provided by operating activities was
approximately $887.7 million as compared to $1.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Principal uses of cash flows in 2022 were purchases of investments, purchases of treasury stock, the
acquisition of CANarchy, development of our brands internationally and acquisitions of real property,
property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal
recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital
Resources”).

49Opportunities, Challenges and Risks
Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage
industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s
status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A
– Risk Factors.”
In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or
municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy
and alcohol drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks at certain establishments
or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine and/or alcohol content, require certain
product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions
for the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy
drinks and their perceived benefits, or alcohol drinks and their misuse or abuse, as well as articles
indicating certain health risks of energy or alcohol drinks have been published. The proposal and/or
adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of
similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company.
In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic
markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our
growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in
conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations.
Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale
of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from
obesity and inactive lifestyles as well as alcohol consumption continue to represent a challenge.
We recognize that obesity and alcohol abuse and misuse are complex and serious public health
problems. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet,
light and low calorie beverages within our product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing
consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).
Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative
beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part,
upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet
consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and
expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages
and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual
property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may
adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.
In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial
results include, but are not limited to:
●the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;
●changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;
●economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;
●the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
●maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;
●increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including
obesity, caffeine and/or alcohol consumption and energy and/or alcohol drinks generally, and
changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;
Table of Contents
50●profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See
“Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and
Marketing”);
●costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;
●the risks associated with entering into new sectors in the beverage industry, in particular the
alcohol beverage sector, and making acquisitions to implement our growth strategy;
●increases in costs of raw materials used by us;
●restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government
regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients
including flavors, flavor ingredients and supplement ingredients, due to port strikes and/or
port congestion, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, related labor issues or other
importation impediments;
●protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and our
continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for
our expanding product lines;
●limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans, other packaging materials and
ingredients;
●limitations on co-packing availability and in particular, consolidation in the co-packing
industry;
●increases in ocean and domestic freight rates;
●the long-term impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom;
●the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy or
alcohol drinks, limiting caffeine or alcohol content in beverages, requiring product labeling
and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or
age restrictions; and
●the continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic.
See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties
facing our Company.
We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:
●domestic and international growth potential of our products;
●growth potential of the energy drink and alcohol beverage categories, both domestically and
internationally;
●growth potential of the affordable energy drink category;
●planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of
increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;
●the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;
●package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;
●effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;
●broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;
●launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and
international markets and channels;
●continued focus on reducing our cost base; and
●our entry into the alcohol category and development of our alcohol portfolio.

Net Sales
Net sales were $6.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately
$769.7 million, or 13.9% higher than net sales of $5.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net
sales increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand
energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand, as well as due to pricing actions and reductions
in promotions in certain markets. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable
impact on net sales of approximately $239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net sales on a
foreign currency adjusted basis increased 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment
increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy
drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an
unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $222.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment on a
foreign currency adjusted basis increased 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $353.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2022, an increase of approximately $58.7 million, or 19.9% higher than net sales of $294.8 million for the

increased worldwide sales by volume of our Predator® and NOS® brand energy drinks as a result of
increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact
on net sales of approximately $17.2 million for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December
31, 2022. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 25.8%
for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Net sales for the Alcohol Brands segment were $101.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). There were no comparative 2021 net
sales for the Alcohol Brands segment as the Company completed its acquisition of CANarchy on
February 17, 2022.
Net sales for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a
decrease of approximately $3.0 million, or 11.5% lower than net sales of $25.9 million for the year ended

Case sales for our energy drink products, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 701.7 million cases
for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately 88.2 million cases or 14.4% higher
than case sales of 613.4 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2021. The overall average net
sales per case for our energy drink products (excluding net sales of Alcohol Brands and Other segments)
decreased to $8.82 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was 1.9% lower than the average net
sales per case of $8.99 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the average net sales per
case was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix.
Barrel sales for our craft beers and hard seltzers, in 31 US gallon equivalents, were 0.3 million
barrels for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31,

Table of Contents
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 50.3% for the year ended December 31,
2022 from 56.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease for the year ended December 31,
2022 was primarily the result of increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the
importation of aluminum cans, increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging
materials, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, increased
co-packing fees, production inefficiencies and geographical sales mix.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses were $1.59 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of
approximately $278.8 million, or 21.3% higher than total operating expenses of $1.31 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2021.
The comparative operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $16.9
million reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim. The
increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses of
$92.9 million, including travel and entertainment, professional service fees (including legal and
accounting) and depreciation and amortization, increased out-bound fuel, freight and warehouse costs of
$74.3 million, increased selling and marketing expenses of $59.9 million, including sponsorships and
endorsements, point of sale, premiums and allocated trade development, and increased payroll expenses
of $57.0 million (of which $23.1 million was related to CANarchy). In addition, CANarchy related
depreciation and amortization was $8.7 million for year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in
operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in distributor termination expenses of $5.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
were 25.2% and 23.7%, respectively. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 (pre
COVID-19) were $1.12 billion, or 26.6% of net sales.
Operating Income
Operating income was $1.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of
approximately $212.7 million, or 11.8% lower than operating income of $1.80 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2022 from 32.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating income for the year
ended December 31, 2022 decreased primarily as a result of the increase in operating expenses as well as
the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
Operating income was $316.3 million and $402.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, for our operations in EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, exclusive of corporate and
unallocated expenses, was $1.85 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of
approximately $140.7 million, or 7.1% lower than operating income of $1.99 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was
primarily the result of an increase in operating expenses as well as a decrease in gross profit as a
percentage of net sales.
Operating income for the Strategic Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated
expenses, was $197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $24.0
million, or 13.8% higher than operating income of $173.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was primarily the result of a $30.6
million increase in gross profit.
Operating loss for the Alcohol Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses,
was $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to
December 31, 2022). The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due in part to (i)
53excess depreciation and amortization as well as the fair value treatment of purchased inventory, all
relating to the CANarchy Transaction, (ii) increased input costs and an underutilization
Table of Contents
54of fixed overhead and (iii) sales volume declines primarily of Wild BasinTM due in part to overall sales
declines in the hard seltzer category. The inventory acquired, which was subsequently sold, was
recognized through cost of goods sold at fair value (purchased cost), resulting in no recognized profits on
the associated sales.
Operating income for the Other segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was
$3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $3.9 million, or 56.2%
lower than operating income of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other (Expense) Income, net
Other (expense) income, net, was ($12.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as
compared to other (expense) income, net, of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) were ($37.9) million and $0.3 million for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest income was $29.7 million and $4.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes was $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease
of $43.6 million, or 10.3% lower than the provision for income taxes of $423.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate was 24.2% and 23.5% for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was
primarily attributable to the decrease in income in certain foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates
compared to the United States.
Net Income
Net income was $1.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $185.9
million, or 13.5% lower than net income of $1.38 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the decrease in the
gross profit percentage of net sales as well as the increase in operating expenses.
Key Business Metrics
We use certain key metrics and financial measures not prepared in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate and manage our business. For a further

55gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $268.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022.
Gross billings for the Strategic Brands segment were $398.7 million for the year ended December

ended December 31, 2021. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on
gross billings in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $17.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022.
Gross billings for the Alcohol Brands segment were $103.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). There were no comparative 2021
gross billings for the Alcohol Brands segment as the Company completed its acquisition of CANarchy on
February 17, 2022.
Gross billings for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a
decrease of $3.0 million, or 11.5% lower than gross billings of $25.9 million for the year ended December

Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses, as described in the footnote below,
were $990.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $65.8 million, or 7.1% higher
than promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses of $924.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Promotional allowances as a percentage of gross billings were 13.6% and 14.4% for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
**Gr oss billings represent amounts invoiced to customers net of cash discounts, returns and excise taxes. Gross billings are used
internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular
products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evalua ting overall Company
performance. The use of gross billings allows evalua tion of sales performance befor e the effect of any promotional items, which
can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measur e of our
operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measur e that is recognized under GAAP  and should not be consider ed
as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accor dance with GAAP , and should not be used alone as an indicator of
operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally , gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measur es used
by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be
realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from
certain customers.

***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation
thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be
comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products primarily include
consideration given to our non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted
off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions
of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our
agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv)
our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given
to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii)
contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’
sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other
allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such
sales. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional
allowance programs for our energy drink products with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate
agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are
of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for our energy
drink products for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and
(iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Promotional and other allowances for our Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price
promotions where permitted.
Sales
The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past three years.
Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.
Sales of our energy drinks are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of
measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case
volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as
if converted into finished products, sold by us.
Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased
demand in the warmer months of the year. Beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth
quarters of each calendar year. However, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are
less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. In addition, our continued growth
internationally may further reduce the impact of seasonality on our business. Quarterly fluctuations may
also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets
where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors, changes in
the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. The

57COVID-19 pandemic, including new variants, may also have an impact on consumer behavior and change
the seasonal fluctuation of our business. (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Seasonality”).

Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on both net sales and the overall
average net sales per case for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Unit Sales of our alcohol products are expressed in barrel equivalents (“Barrel”). A Barrel is a unit of
measurement equal to 31 U.S. gallons. Barrel sales were 0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
(effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022).
Inflation
Inflation had a negative impact on our results of operations, leading to increased cost of sales and
operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. To mitigate the impact of inflation,
we implemented a price increase effective September 1, 2022 in the United States and continue to
implement price increases in certain international markets where feasible.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2022, we
had $1.31 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.36 billion in short-term investments and $61.4 million
in long-term investments. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for
purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on
short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining
our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and
investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to
general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These market risks associated with our investment
portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Of our $1.31 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2022, $668.9 million was
held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign
subsidiaries at December 31, 2022.
We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and access to credit,
will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and
inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs,
purchases of capital assets, purchases of equipment, purchases of real property and purchases of shares of
our common stock, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital expenditures
(exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be less than $300.0 million through December 31,
2023. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.
Table of Contents
Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property
and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements,
advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks,
payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to
remain our principal recurring use of cash.

property, fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support
59our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and
computer equipment, computer software, equipment used for sales and administrative activities, certain
leasehold improvements, improvements to real property as well as the acquisition, defense and

term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment
(specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise
displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our
existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets) and for other corporate
purposes. From time to time, we may also use cash to purchase additional real property related to our
beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses.
Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $706.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of
$34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash flows used in financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock. The cash
flows provided by financing activities for both the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 was
primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock related to stock-based compensation.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial
statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being
reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” for a summary of our significant accounting policies.
Table of Contents
The following summarizes our most significant critical accounting estimates:
Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition
exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects.
Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative
factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is
less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Application of the goodwill
impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment
of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of
the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a
discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount
rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates. The
estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating
results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially
affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will
recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair
value. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no goodwill impairments
recorded and there are no accumulated impairment balances.
Other Intangibles – In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are
not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an
impairment exists. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined on a relief from
royalty methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to
license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e.
royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the
estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. This analysis requires
significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues and terminal growth rates. A
significant change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinite-
lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values. The Company amortizes
its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the year ended December 31,
2022, an impairment charge of $2.2 million was recorded to intangibles. For the year ended December 31,
2021 no impairment charges were recorded to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an
impairment charge of $8.7 million was recorded to intangibles.
Revenue Recognition – Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a
reduction to net sales for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to the
Company’s non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the
following:
●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by
retailers;
●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their
promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other
fees for both new and existing products;
●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to
retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;
●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given
directly to retailers;
●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or
exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;
●discounted or free products;
●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made
directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’
61sales territories; and
Table of Contents
62●commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of
TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.
The Company’s promotional allowance programs for its energy drink products with its
bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of
business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and
are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other
allowances for its energy drink products are calculated based on various programs with
bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated
liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience
with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer
participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such
estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been
insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.
Promotional and other allowances for the Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price
promotions where permitted.

The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports
filed with the SEC is not exhaustive. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion
of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk
factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or
developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our
66
Table of Contents
67forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results.
Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by
our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and
may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the
date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking
statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order
to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the
extent required by applicable securities laws.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks.
The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to
which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw
materials (including, but not limited to, increases in the costs of aluminum cans, as well as sugar,
sucralose and other sweeteners, glucose, sucrose, juice concentrates, milk, cream, coffee, tea, hops, malt
and yeast, all of which are used in some or many of our products), fluctuations in energy and fuel prices,
as well as limitations in the availability of aluminum cans and certain other raw materials and packaging
materials. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks
associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with
respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through
higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest
rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices.
Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 37% of consolidated
net sales for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our growth strategy includes expanding
our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts
with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign
exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries’ non-functional currency
denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts entered into by us as of
December 31, 2022 have terms of three months or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange
contracts for speculation or trading purposes.
We have not designated our foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under
FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on our foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in
other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the
changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. We do not consider the potential
loss resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates as of
December 31, 2022 to be significant.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.31 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.36 billion in
short-term investments and $61.4 million in long-term investments Certain of these investments are
subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks.

Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of the
SEC and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and
principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting – Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, our management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022, based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
management’s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2022.
Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting – There were no changes in the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

69REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Monster Beverage Corporation
Corona, California
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Monster Beverage Corporation and
subsidiaries (the ”Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control —Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established
in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2023,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

78REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Monster Beverage Corporation
Corona, California
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Monster Beverage Corporation and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item
15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and
that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

79Accrued Promotional Allowances — Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its
bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of the initial product sale
for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed-upon terms as well as the
Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect
to estimating consumer participation and/or bottler/distributor and retail customer performance levels.
Promotional and other allowances for the Company’s energy drink products primarily include
consideration given to its non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers, including, but not limited
to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end consumers by
retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend
with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees for both new and existing
products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising,
in-store marketing, and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances, and
other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to
bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi)
discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the
Company directly to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii)
certain commissions paid based on sales to bottlers/distributors. The promotional programs for the
Company’s energy drink products are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year
based on the agreed-upon terms. The nature of such programs is determined on a per retail customer basis,
and in certain instances, the same program is set for multiple retail customers. The promotional
expenditures are recorded as a reduction to net sales in the period the underlying sale occurs. Total
promotional expenditures included as a reduction to net sales were $990.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, and accrued promotional allowances were $255.6 million as of December 31, 2022.
We identified accrued promotional allowances as a critical audit matter because of the extent and
subjective nature of management judgment required with respect to estimating consumer participation
and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels and future promotional claims, which required a
high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures over accrued promotional allowances for energy drink products, with respect to
management’s judgment regarding levels of consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer
performance levels and future promotional claims, included the following, among others:
●We tested the effectiveness of controls over accrued promotional allowances, including those
controls pertaining to management’s estimation of future promotional claims.
●We selected a sample of accrued promotional allowances recorded for specific distributors
and retail customers and sent confirmation requests of the accrual recorded and key terms of
the agreement directly to the distributor or retail customer. We compared the confirmation
response to the accrued amount recorded by the Company. In instances of nonreplies to our
confirmation request from the distributor or retail customer, we performed alternative
procedures as follows: (1) developing an expectation of the accrual using current-year claim
and payment data, and/or (2) vouching known claim submissions, unpaid as of period-end, to
underlying supporting documentation.
●We tested the promotional expenditure amount recorded as a reduction to net sales and
assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimate by developing an expectation of the
amount, based on historical promotional expenditure amounts recorded as a percentage of
sales, and compared our expectation to the recorded promotional expenditure amount.
Table of Contents
80●We performed inquiries with the Company’s sales and marketing personnel to corroborate our
understanding of new and existing promotional programs that may alter the relationship
between gross billings and promotional allowances, as such programs are considered by
management when estimating future promotional claims.
●We evaluated management’s ability to estimate promotional allowances by comparing the
actual promotional allowances subsequently paid to the original estimates of management.

871.          ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization – Monster Beverage Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of
Delaware. The Company is a holding company and has no operating business except through its
consolidated subsidiaries.
Nature of Operations – The Company develops, markets, sells and distributes energy drink
beverages and concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names:
Monster Energy®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Rehab®, Monster Energy® Nitro, Java Monster®,
Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Hydro® Energy Water, Monster Hydro® Super Sport,
Monster Super Fuel®, Monster Dragon Tea®, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno® Thermogenic
Fuel, Reign Storm®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power
Play® (stylized), Relentless®, BPM®, BU®, Gladiator®, Samurai®, Live+®, Predator®, Fury® and
True North®.
The Company also develops, markets, sells and distributes craft beers, flavored malt beverages
(“FMBs”) and hard seltzers under a number of brands, including Jai Alai® IPA, Florida ManTM IPA,
Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild BasinTM Hard Seltzers, Dallas Blonde®, Deep EllumTM IPA, Perrin Brewing
CompanyTM Black Ale, Hop Rising® Double IPA, Wasatch® Apricot Hefeweizen, The Beast
UnleashedTM and a host of other brands.
Basis of Presentation – The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Amounts previously classified in certain property and equipment balances totaling $20.1 million
as of December 31, 2021 have been reclassified to assets under construction to conform to presentation as
of December 31, 2022. See Note 9.
Principles of Consolidation – The Company consolidates all entities that it controls by ownership
of a majority voting interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Business Combinations – Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business
Combinations”. FASB ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the
acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure
goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results are included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at
their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.
Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer
than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-
acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure
certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a
business combination.
Cash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the
year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured
limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to
incur any losses in the future.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
Investments – The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-
maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with FASB ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are
those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading
securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not
included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under FASB ASC 326-30-
35, a security is considered to be impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost
basis. Where the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss, the
Company will record an impairment relating to credit losses through an allowance for credit losses. The
allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Impairment
that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive
income (loss), net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its
investments has resulted from credit loss or other factors at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a
review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities
held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer’s financial condition and,
if applicable, information on the guarantors’ financial condition. Factors considered in determining
whether an impairment has resulted from credit loss or other factors include the length of time and extent
to which the investment’s fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations
of the issuer and the Company’s intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.
Accounts Receivable – The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable
based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific
customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is
estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company
believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts,
bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company’s recent loss history and an overall assessment of
past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with FASB ASC 210-20-45, in its
consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional
allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and
related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis.
Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net
realizable value).
Property and Equipment – Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture
and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, real property and vehicles is
based on their estimated useful lives (three to thirty years) and is calculated using the straight-line
method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or
the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful
lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and
any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.
Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition
exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects.
88Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is

MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of
impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-
than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company reasonably
determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company
performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
with its carrying amount. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the
carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020 there were no goodwill impairments recorded and there are no accumulated impairment balances.
Other Intangibles – Other Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the
Company’s exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Dragon
Tea®, Unleash the Beast!®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Espresso Monster®,
Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Monster Hydro®, Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Monster Super
Fuel®, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Inferno®, Predator®, Fury®, True North®, NOS®, Full
Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Nalu®, Ultra Energy®, Play® and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®,
BPM®, BU®, Gladiator®, Samurai®, Oskar Blues Brewery®, Cigar City®, Deep Ellum Brewing Co®,
Perrin Brewing Company®, Squatters®, Wasatch®, Jai Alai®, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Dallas Blonde®, Wild
Basin®, Dale’s®, Mama’s Little Yella Pils®, Hop Rising® and The Beast UnleashedTM trademarks, all
used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns a
number of other trademarks, flavors and formulas in the United States, as well as in a number of countries
around the world. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an
impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its
indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair
value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their
respective useful lives. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, impairment charges of $2.2
million and $8.7 million, respectively, were recorded to indefinite-lived intangibles. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, no impairments were recorded.
We presently have more than 17,500 registered trademarks and pending applications in various
countries worldwide, and we apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis. We regard our trademarks,
service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and other intellectual property as very important to
our business. We consider Monster®, Monster Energy®, ®, Monster Energy Ultra®, Monster Dragon
Iced Tea®, Unleash the Beast!®, Rehab® Monster®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Punch
Monster®, Juice Monster®, Hydro® (stylized), Monster HydroSport Super Fuel®, Hydro Super Sport®,
Monster Super Fuel®, Espresso Monster®, Monster Energy® Nitro, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign
Inferno®, True North®, BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra Energy®, Play®
and Power Play® (stylized), Relentless®, Predator®, Fury®, Live+®, BPM®, Gladiator®, Samurai®,
Oskar Blues Brewery®, Cigar City®, Deep Ellum Brewing Co®, Perrin Brewing Company®,
Squatters®, Wasatch®, Jai Alai®, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Dallas Blonde®, Wild Basin®, Dale’s®, Mama’s
Little Yella Pils®, Hop Rising® and The Beast UnleashedTM to be our core trademarks. We also own the
intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy
drinks in perpetuity.
Leases – See Note 4.
Long-Lived Assets – Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived
assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate
of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an

89impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is
estimated
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management’s
estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently
subjective and is based on management’s best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future
conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no impairment indicators
identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value
less cost to sell.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions – The accounts of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or
losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders’ equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany
transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the
foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’
equity. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company entered into forward
currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically
manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries
non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts
outstanding as of December 31, 2022 have terms of three months or less. The Company does not enter
into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.
The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions
under FASB ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts
are recognized in other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of income, and are largely
offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item. For the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, aggregate foreign currency transaction gains (losses), including the
gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts, amounted to ($37.9) million, $0.3 million and
($11.2) million, respectively, and have been recorded in other (expense) income, net, in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.
Revenue Recognition – See Note 3.
Cost of Sales – Cost of sales consists of the costs of flavors, concentrates, supplement ingredients
and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of beverages, co-packing
fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses
incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. In
addition, the Company includes in costs of sales certain costs such as depreciation, amortization and
payroll costs that relate to the direct manufacture by the Company of certain flavors and concentrates.
Raw materials account for the largest portion of cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other
containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.
Operating Expenses – Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses
to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for
advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale
materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses.
Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees
including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company’s prior distributors,
depreciation and other general and administrative costs.
Freight-Out Costs – For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, freight-out costs
amounted to $249.2 million, $213.9 million and $134.1 million, respectively, and have been recorded in
operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
91Advertising and Promotional Expenses – The Company accounts for advertising production costs
by expensing such production costs the first time the related advertising takes place. A significant amount
of the Company’s promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement and sponsorship
contracts. Accounting for endorsement and sponsorship payments is based upon specific contract
provisions. Generally, endorsement and sponsorship payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over
the term of the contract after giving recognition to the periodic performance compliance provisions of the
contracts. Advertising and promotional expenses, including, but not limited to, production costs amounted
to $460.7 million, $417.6 million and $345.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively. Advertising and promotional expenses are included in operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Income Taxes – The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set
forth in FASB ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected
to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded
when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the
need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the availability
of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its
recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing
earnings in the period in which such determination is made.
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to
examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available
at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit
will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be
realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will
be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation – The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the
provisions of FASB ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options
based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options
based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for
performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-
employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-
based compensation cost for restricted stock units and performance share units is measured based on the
closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the
Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit or performance share unit in cash, the
award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. See Note 16.
Net Income Per Common Share – In accordance with FASB ASC 260, net income per common
share, on a basic and diluted basis, is presented for all periods. Basic net income per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. The calculation of common equivalent
shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury share repurchases at
average market prices, as applicable.

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
92Concentration of Risk – Certain of the Company’s products utilize components (raw materials
and/or co-packing services) from a limited number of sources. A disruption in the supply of such
components could significantly affect the Company’s revenues from those products, as alternative sources
of such components may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or within a reasonably short
time period. The Company continues to endeavor to secure the availability of alternative sources for such
components and minimize the risk of any disruption in production.
The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”), through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “TCCC
Subsidiaries”), accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended December
31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of the Company’s
net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC accounted for approximately 9%, 10% and 11% of the
Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Coca-Cola Europacific Partners accounted for approximately 13%, 12% and 10% of the
Company’s net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Credit Risk – The Company sells its products nationally and internationally, primarily to bottlers
and full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass
merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers
and the military. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does
not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses, and historically, such
losses have been within management’s expectations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments.
Use of Estimates – The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements – In October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08, “Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 805)”. ASU No. 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to
recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts
using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the
revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the
ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim
period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for
which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. The Company adopted ASU No.
2021-08 on January 1, 2023, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.

932.          ACQUISITIONS
On February 17, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of CANarchy Craft Brewery
Collective LLC (“CANarchy”), a craft beer and hard seltzer company, for $329.5 million in cash (net of
cash acquired), after certain working capital adjustments (the “CANarchy Transaction”). The CANarchy
Transaction facilitates the Company’s entry into the alcohol beverage sector and brings the Cigar CityTM
family of brands including Jai Alai® IPA and Florida ManTM IPA, the Oskar BluesTM family of brands
including Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild BasinTM Hard Seltzers, the Deep EllumTM family of brands including
Dallas Blonde® and Deep EllumTM IPA, the Perrin Brewing CompanyTM family of brands including
Black Ale, the Squatters® family of brands including Hop Rising® Double IPA, the Wasatch® family of
brands including Apricot Hefeweizen, as well as certain other brands (collectively the “CANarchy
Brands”) to the Company’s beverage portfolio. The transaction did not include CANarchy’s stand-alone
restaurants. The Company’s organizational structure for its existing energy beverage business remains
unchanged. CANarchy is functioning independently, retaining its own organizational structure and team.
The Company accounted for the CANarchy Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations”.
The following table summarizes the final fair value allocations of the CANarchy Transaction:
Identifiable 
Assets Acquired 
and Liabilities Consideration 
     Assumed     Transferred
Intangibles - trademarks (non-amortizing) $ 89,500$ —
Intangibles - customer relationships (amortizing)  54,500 —
Intangibles - permits (non-amortizing)  6,000 —
Property and equipment  81,285 —
Inventory  18,300 —
Right-of-use assets  12,836 —
Operating lease liabilities  (12,836) —
Working capital (excluding inventory)  (5,640) —
Other  (770) —
Goodwill  86,298 —
Cash  3,248 332,721
Total $ 332,721$ 332,721
During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company identified a measurement period adjustment to
the Company’s previous purchase accounting estimates for the CANarchy Transaction. The adjustments to
the estimated values previously disclosed, resulted from the completed assessment of certain trademarks.
As a result, Intangibles – trademarks (non-amortizing) decreased and Goodwill increased by $5.0 million,
respectively, from amounts previously reported.
The Company determined the fair values as follows:
●Trademarks – relief-from-royalty method of the income approach
●Customer relationships – distributor method of the income approach
●Permits – with-and-without method of the income approach
●Property and equipment – cost approach
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
●Inventory – comparative sales method and replacement cost method
The book value of the working capital (excluding inventory) approximates fair value due to the
short-term nature of the accounts.
The Company has determined goodwill in accordance with ASC 805, which requires the
recognition of goodwill for the excess of the aggregate consideration over the net amounts of identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
For tax purposes, the CANarchy Transaction was recorded as an asset purchase. As such, the
Company received a step-up in tax basis of the CANarchy assets, net, equal to the purchase price.
In accordance with Regulation S-X, pro forma unaudited condensed financial information for the
CANarchy Transaction has not been provided as the impact of the transaction on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity was not material.
On May 5, 2022, the Company acquired certain real property and equipment in Norwalk,
California for a purchase price of $62.5 million. The acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition for
accounting purposes. The fair value allocations include $50.6 million for land, $10.0 million for building
and $1.9 million for equipment. The Company intends to utilize the property as a manufacturing facility
for certain of its products.
3.           REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with
Consumers”. The Company has four operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks
segment (“Monster Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy®
drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Monster® Tour WaterTM and True
North® Pure Energy Seltzers, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic Brands”), which is primarily
comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”) in 2015
as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, (iii) Alcohol Brands segment (“Alcohol Brands”),
which is primarily comprised of the various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the
CANarchy Transaction on February 17, 2022 as well as The Beast UnleashedTM FMBs and (iv) Other
segment (“Other”), which is comprised of certain products sold by American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party
Products”).
The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by
selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage
bottlers/distributors (“bottlers/distributors”). In some cases, the Company sells ready-to-drink packaged
energy drinks directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers,
convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the
military.
The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club
stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-
commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the Strategic Brands segment generates net
operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.

The Company’s Alcohol Brands segment primarily generates operating revenues by selling
kegged and ready-to-drink canned beers, hard seltzers and FMBs primarily to beer distributors in the
United States.
The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single performance
obligation by transferring control of its products to a customer. Control is generally transferred when the
Company’s products are either shipped or delivered based on the terms contained within the underlying
contracts or agreements. Certain of the Company’s bottlers/distributors may also perform a separate
function as a co-packer on the Company’s behalf. In such cases, control of the Company’s products passes
to such bottlers/distributors when they notify the Company that they have taken possession or transferred
the relevant portion of the Company’s finished goods. The Company’s general payment terms are short-
term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The
Company did not have any material unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 and
2021.
The Company excludes from revenues all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are
imposed on the sale of its products and collected from customers.
Distribution expenses to transport the Company’s products, where applicable, and warehousing
expense after manufacture are accounted for within operating expenses.
Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales for
the Company’s energy drink products, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s non-
alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:
●discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by
retailers;
●reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their
promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other
fees for both new and existing products;
●the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to
retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;
●the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given
directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers;
●incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or
exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;
●discounted or free products;
●contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made
directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’
sales territories; and
●commissions to TCCC based on the Company’s sales to wholly-owned subsidiaries of
TCCC (the “TCCC Subsidiaries”) and/or to TCCC bottlers/distributors accounted for
under the equity method by TCCC (the “TCCC Related Parties”).
The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its non-alcohol bottlers/distributors and/or
retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements
generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations,
typically ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances for its
energy drink products are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail
customers, and accruals are established at the time of initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated
liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience
with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer
participation and/or bottler/distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such
estimated expenses and actual expenses

96for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in
earnings in the period such differences are determined. Promotional and other allowances for our Alcohol
Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted.
Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with
certain bottlers/distributors relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior
distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated
life of the respective distribution agreements, generally over 20 years.
The Company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-
party sales of non-beverage products bearing the Company’s trademarks including, but not limited to,
clothing, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and
spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience.

2Effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022
Contract Liabilities
Amounts received from certain bottlers/distributors at inception of their distribution contracts or
at the inception of certain sales/marketing programs are accounted for as deferred revenue. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $267.1 million and $285.8 million of deferred revenue,
respectively, which is included in current and long-term deferred revenue in the Company’s
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
$40.0 million, $41.5 million and $42.1 million, respectively, of deferred revenue, was recognized in net
sales. See Note 11.
4.          LEASES
The Company leases identified assets comprised of real estate and equipment. Real estate leases
consist primarily of office and warehouse space and equipment leases consist of vehicles and warehouse
equipment. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a
lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct
identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from
the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the
asset. At inception of a lease, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and
non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease
payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.
Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC 842,
“Leases”. The Company’s operating leases are comprised of real estate and warehouse equipment, and the
Company’s finance leases are comprised of vehicles.
Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases generally do
not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate
of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date.
ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that
option.
Certain of the Company’s real estate leases contain variable lease payments, including payments
based on an index or rate. Variable lease payments based on an index or rate are initially measured using
the index or rate in effect at the lease

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
98commencement date. Additional payments based on the change in an index or rate, or payments based on
a change in the Company’s portion of real estate taxes and insurance, are recorded as a period expense
when incurred.
Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.
Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis
over the asset’s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement
of income. Interest expense on finance leases is calculated using the amortized cost basis and is included
in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statement of income.
The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to 11 years, some of
which include options to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which include options to
terminate the leases within one year. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease
liabilities for short-term operating leases that have a term of 12 months or less.
The components of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as

The Company’s investments at December 31, 2022 and 2021 carried investment grade credit
ratings. Variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”) are floating rate municipal bonds with embedded put
options that allow the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued interest. All of the put options are
secured by a pledged liquidity source. While they are classified as marketable investment securities, the
put option allows the VRDNs to be liquidated at par on a same day, or more generally, on a seven-day
settlement basis.

6.          FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement”, provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires
disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. ASC 820 also
101
Table of Contents
MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
102establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where
available. The three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value
are summarized below.
●Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or
liabilities.
●Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
ASC 820 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when measuring
fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever possible.
The following tables present the fair value of Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are
recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated among the appropriate levels within the fair value
hierarchy at:

All of the Company’s short-term and long-term investments are classified within Level 1 or Level
2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s valuation of its Level 1 investments is based on quoted
market prices in active markets for identical securities. The Company’s valuation of its Level 2
investments is based on other observable inputs, specifically a market approach which utilizes valuation
models, pricing systems, mathematical tools and other relevant information for the same or similar
securities. The Company’s valuation of its Level 2 foreign currency exchange contracts is based on quoted
market prices of the same or similar instruments, adjusted for counterparty risk. There were no transfers
between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
there were no changes in the Company’s valuation techniques.
7.          DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks related primarily to its foreign
business operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company entered
into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to
specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated
subsidiaries’ non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange
contracts of the Company that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 have terms of three months or
less. The Company does not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading
purposes.
The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions
under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company’s foreign
currency exchange contracts are recognized in other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements
of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged
item.

11.        DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS
In accordance with ASC 420 “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations”, the Company expenses
distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs. The
Company incurred no termination costs for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company incurred
termination costs of $5.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses in
the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
In the normal course of business, amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution
agreements entered into with certain bottlers/distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating
agreements with the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and are
recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally
20 years. Revenue recognized was $21.4 million, $21.5 million and $21.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
12.        DEBT
The Company entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) consisting of a
revolving line of credit, which was amended in April 2020, under which the Company may borrow up to
$10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2025.
Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica’s base (prime) rate minus 1.00% to
1.50%, or London Interbank Offered Rates plus an additional percentage of 1.25% to 1.75%, depending
upon certain financial ratios maintained by the Company. The Company had no outstanding borrowings
on this line of credit at December 31, 2022. Under this revolving line of credit, the Company may also
issue standby Letters of Credit with an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 million. The fee on the standby
Letters of Credit ranges from 1.00% to 1.50% depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by the
Company. The Company had no outstanding standby Letters of Credit at December 31, 2022.
The Company has a credit facility with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch,
of $15.0 million. At December 31, 2022, the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit was 5.5%.
As of December 31, 2022, $7.8 million was outstanding on this line of credit.

10813.        COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contractual Obligations – The Company had the following contractual obligations related
primarily to sponsorships and other marketing activities as of December 31, 2022:
Year Ending December 31:      
2023     $ 239,350
2024 51,162
2025 14,153
2026 9,586
2027 —
2028 and thereafter —
 $ 314,251
Purchase Commitments – The Company had purchase commitments aggregating approximately
$328.0 million at December 31, 2022, which represented commitments made by the Company and its
subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the production of its products. These obligations vary
in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year.
The Company purchases various raw material items, including, but not limited to, flavors,
ingredients, supplement ingredients, containers, milk, glucose, sucralose and cream, from a limited
number of suppliers. An interruption in supply from any of such resources could result in the Company’s
inability to produce certain products for limited or possibly extended periods of time. The aggregate value
of purchases from suppliers of such limited resources described above for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020 was $666.1 million, $698.0 million and $401.8 million, respectively.
Guarantees – The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that
contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third-party claims. These contracts
primarily relate to: (i) certain agreements with the Company’s officers, directors and employees under
which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their
employment relationship, (ii) certain distribution or purchase agreements under which the Company may
have to indemnify the Company’s customers from any claim, liability or loss arising out of any actual or
alleged injury or damages suffered in connection with the consumption or purchase of the Company’s
products or the use of Company trademarks, and (iii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company
may be required to indemnify property owners for liabilities and other claims arising from the Company’s
use of the applicable premises. The terms of such obligations vary and typically, a maximum obligation is
not explicitly stated. Generally, the Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate to cover any
resulting liabilities or claims.
Litigation – From time to time in the normal course of business, the Company is named in
litigation, including labor and employment matters, personal injury matters, consumer class actions,
intellectual property matters and claims from prior distributors. Although it is not possible to predict the
ultimate outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to the Company, management believes that
such litigation in aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.
The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other
matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued, if any, and
any related insurance reimbursements. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no loss contingencies were
included in the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

On September 29, 2022, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the
“District Court”) awarded Monster Energy Company (“MEC”) approximately $293 million in damages in
its false advertising and trade secrets case against Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“VPX”), the maker of Bang
Energy. The jury found VPX and its chief executive officer to have falsely advertised the “Super
Creatine” ingredient of Bang Energy and to have acted willfully and deliberately in violating the federal
Lanham Act. The jury also found that VPX stole trade secrets and interfered with MEC’s contracts over
shelf space with certain key vendors. The parties are currently briefing post-verdict issues, including
MEC’s motion for a permanent injunction relating to “Super Creatine” and request for enhanced and
punitive damages.
In April 2022, MEC and Orange Bang, Inc. (“Orange Bang”) filed a joint motion in the District
Court to confirm a final arbitration award against VPX that awarded MEC and Orange Bang $175.0
million and a 5% royalty on all future sales of VPX’s Bang Energy drink and other Bang-branded
products as well as certain fees and costs. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between MEC and
Orange Bang, the award and future royalties will, after accounting for MEC’s expended fees and costs, be
shared equally between MEC and Orange Bang. The arbitration arose from a settlement agreement that
VPX entered into in 2010 with Orange Bang, a family-owned beverage business. Pursuant to the terms of
that agreement, VPX is only permitted to use the Bang mark on “creatine-based” products or on Bang
products that are marketed and sold only in the vitamin and dietary supplement sections of stores. On
September 29, 2022, the District Court entered final judgment confirming the award. On October 28,
2022, VPX filed a notice of appeal of the District Court’s final judgment confirming the award.
On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Florida. Due to such
ongoing proceedings, VPX’s appeal of the District Court’s final judgment confirming the final arbitration
award is stayed. While reserving all rights to appeal, VPX made its first royalty payment of $3.6 million
on February 14, 2023, which is for sales of Bang Energy drink and other Bang-branded products from
October 10, 2022 through December 31, 2022. This payment is subject to potential claw back if, among
other things, the judgment and final arbitration award are overturned on appeal or VPX becomes
administratively insolvent. In addition, per ASC 450 “Contingencies”, the Company will not recognize the
September 2022 jury award or April 2022 arbitration award until the awards are realized or realizable. As
of March 1, 2023, the proceedings have yet to progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for
an accurate timeline of when the awards, including any royalty payments received, will be realized or
realizable, if at all.

Total accumulated other comprehensive loss  $(159,073) $(69,165)
15.        TREASURY STOCK PURCHASE
On March 13, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase
program for the purchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the
“March 2020 Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased
approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $86.89 per share, for a
total amount of approximately $441.5 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted the
availability under the March 2020 Repurchase Plan.

110On June 14, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for
the purchase of up to an additional $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the
“June 2022 Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased
approximately 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $88.73 per share, for a
total amount of approximately $317.2 million (excluding broker commissions), under the June 2022
Repurchase Plan. As of March 1, 2023, $182.8 million remained available for repurchase under the June
2022 Repurchase Plan.
On November 2, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program
for the purchase of up to an additional $500.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the
“November 2022 Repurchase Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, no shares were
repurchased under the November 2022 Repurchase Plan. As of March 1, 2023, $500.0 million remained
available for repurchase under the November 2022 Repurchase Plan.
The aggregate amount of the Company’s outstanding common stock that remains available for
repurchase under all previously authorized repurchase plans is $682.8 million as of March 1, 2023.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, 0.2 million shares of common stock were purchased
from employees in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding taxes due for a total amount
of $12.5 million. While such purchases are considered common stock repurchases, they are not counted as
purchases against the Company’s authorized share repurchase programs. Such shares are included in
common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022.
16.        STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has two stock-based compensation plans under which shares were available for
grant at December 31, 2022: (i) the Monster Beverage Corporation 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the
“2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan”), which includes the Monster Beverage Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan as a sub plan thereunder, and (ii) the Monster Beverage Corporation 2017
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2017 Directors Plan”), which includes the Monster
Beverage Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors as a sub plan thereunder.
The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on April 14, 2020 and
approved by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held
on June 3, 2020 (the “Effective Date”). The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan replaced the Monster Beverage
Corporation 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan”).
The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other share-based awards up to an
aggregate of 46,169,367 shares of the Company’s common stock, comprised of 32,000,000 new shares of
common stock reserved under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which were authorized on the Effective
Date, and 14,169,367 shares of common stock that were available for grant under the 2011 Omnibus
Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2019 and prior to the Effective Date. Shares authorized under the 2020
Omnibus Incentive Plan are reduced by one (1) share for options or stock appreciation rights granted
under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan and for any grants after December 31, 2019 under the 2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan, and by 2.6 shares for each share granted or issued with respect to a Full Value
Award under either the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan or for any shares granted after December 31, 2019
under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan. A “Full Value Award” is an award other than an incentive stock
option, a non-qualified stock option, or a stock appreciation right, which is settled by the issuance of
shares. Options granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan may be incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), or non-qualified stock options.

Shares previously granted under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan after December 31, 2019 and
prior to the Effective Date of the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan reduced the number of shares available for
grant under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 5,696,341 shares of the
Company’s common stock have been granted, net of cancellations, and 38,873,388 shares (as adjusted for
Full Value Awards) of the Company’s common stock remain available for grant under the 2020 Omnibus
Incentive Plan.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has
sole and exclusive authority to grant stock awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new
hires who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (“Section 16”). Each of the Compensation
Committee and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Executive Committee”)
independently has the authority to grant stock awards to (i) new hires and (ii) employees receiving a
promotion, in each case, who are not Section 16 employees. Awards granted by the Executive Committee
are not subject to approval or ratification by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee.
Options granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest over a three- to five-year period
from the grant date and are generally exercisable up to 10 years after the grant date. Restricted stock units
granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally vest over a three- or five-year period from the
grant date. Performance share units will generally vest based on the achievement of performance goals
specified for the applicable award.
In 2016, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan (as a sub plan to the 2011
Omnibus Incentive Plan), pursuant to which eligible employees may elect to defer cash and/or equity
based compensation and to receive the deferred amounts, together with an investment return (positive or
negative), either at a pre-determined time in the future or upon termination of their employment with the
Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates that are participating employers under the Deferred
Compensation Plan, as provided under the Deferred Compensation Plan and in relevant deferral elections.
Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan are unfunded and unsecured. As of December 31, 2022
deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan are solely comprised of cash compensation and equity
compensation and are not material in the aggregate.
In 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Directors Plan, a successor plan to the 2009 Monster
Beverage Corporation Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2017 Directors Plan
permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares or restricted stock units,
deferred awards, dividend equivalents, and other share based-awards up to an aggregate of 1,250,000
shares of common stock of the Company to non-employee directors of the Company.
Each calendar year, a non-employee director will receive an annual retainer and annual equity
award, as provided for in the 2017 Directors Plan, which may be modified from time to time. In February
2022, the Board of Directors amended and restated the 2017 Directors Plan to provide for increases to the
annual cash retainer and annual equity retainer that non-employee directors are entitled to receive.
Currently, non-employee directors receive an annual equity retainer of approximately $175,000 in the
form of restricted stock units at each annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders or promptly
thereafter. A non-employee director’s annual award of restricted stock units will generally vest on the
earliest to occur of: (a) the last business day immediately preceding the annual meeting of the Company’s
stockholders in the calendar year following the calendar year in which the grant date occurs, (b) a Change
of Control (as defined in the 2017 Directors Plan), (c) the non-employee director’s death, or (d) the date
of the non-employee director’s separation from service due to disability, so long as the non-employee
director remains a non-employee director through such date. The Board of Directors may in its discretion
award non-employee directors stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other share-
based awards in lieu of or in addition to restricted stock units. The Board of Directors may amend or
terminate the 2017 Directors Plan at any time, subject to certain limitations set forth in the 2017 Directors
Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 116,791 shares of the Company’s common stock had been granted under
111the 2017 Directors Plan, and 1,133,209 shares of the Company’s common stock remain available for
grant.

(Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
In 2017, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (as
a sub plan to the 2017 Directors Plan), pursuant to which the Board of Directors may permit non-
employee directors to elect, at such times and in accordance with rules and procedures (or sub-plan)
adopted by the Board of Directors (which are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code, as
applicable), to receive all or any portion of such non-employee director’s compensation, whether payable
in cash or in equity, on a deferred basis. Deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-
Employee Directors are unfunded and unsecured. As of December 31, 2021, deferrals under the Deferred
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors are solely comprised of cash compensation and equity
compensation and are not material in the aggregate. The 2017 Directors Plan was adopted to effectuate
any such deferrals. The 2017 Directors Plan is administered by the Board of Directors. Each award
granted under the 2017 Directors Plan will be evidenced by a written agreement and will contain the terms
and conditions that the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
In February 2022, as part of the Board of Directors’ amendment and restatement of the 2017
Directors Plan, such amendment and restatement also introduced the requirement for each non-employee
director to satisfy the share ownership guidelines set forth below, as may be modified by the Board of
Directors from time to time. The current share ownership guidelines provide that non-employee directors
of the Company must:
●Hold shares of Company common stock having a total value of five times the annual retainer
payable to a non-employee director (excluding any portion of the annual retainer attributable to a
non-employee director’s service as a member of a subcommittee, as a chair of a subcommittee or
as the lead independent director, as applicable). For this purpose, deferred shares or deferred
restricted stock units will be deemed held, to the extent vested.
●The minimum stock ownership level must be achieved by each non-employee director by the fifth
anniversary of such non-employee director’s initial appointment to the Board of Directors.
●Once achieved, ownership of the guideline amount should be maintained for so long as the non-
employee director retains his or her seat on the Board of Directors.
●There may be rare instances where these guidelines would place a hardship on a non-employee
director. In these cases or in similar circumstances, the Board of Directors will make the final
decision as to developing an alternative stock ownership guideline for a non-employee director
that reflects the intention of these guidelines and his or her personal circumstances.
The Company recorded $64.1 million, $70.5 million and $70.3 million of compensation expense
relating to outstanding options, restricted stock units, performance share units and other share-based
awards during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The tax benefit for tax deductions from non-qualified stock option exercises, disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance share units
for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $9.1 million, $6.8 million and $10.5 million,
respectively.
Stock Options
Under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans, all stock options granted through
December 31, 2022 were granted at prices based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the
date of grant. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the
estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company records compensation expense
for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the
date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or
(2) the date at which the non-employee’s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing formula with the

113assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses historical data to determine the exercise
behavior, volatility and forfeiture rate of the options.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options
granted during:
    2022    2021    2020 
Dividend yield 0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  
Expected volatility 27.7%  28.9%  30.4%  
Risk-free interest rate 2.15%  0.85%  0.70%  
Expected term 6.1 Years 5.8 Years 5.8 Years
Expected Volatility: The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of
the expected volatility. Historical volatility is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a
period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option.
Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield
curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.
Expected Term: The Company’s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the
Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on expected time to
post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses historical exercise patterns of
previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise
patterns.

17.        INCOME TAXES
The Company evaluated the various provisions of the Tax Reform Act, including, the global
intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and the foreign derived intangible income provisions. The
Company will treat any U.S. tax on foreign earnings under GILTI as a current period expense when
incurred.
The Company currently considers the earnings of its foreign entities (excluding Japan) to be
permanently reinvested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation
will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been
recorded for the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries excluding Japan. Deferred
income taxes have not been recorded for Japan, as any federal, state, or foreign withholding taxes
associated with the repatriation of those earnings would be immaterial.
The domestic and foreign components of the Company’s income before provision for income
taxes are as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 
    2022     2021     2020

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company established full
valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets, resulting from cumulative net operating losses
incurred by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company. The effect of the valuation allowances and the
subsequent related impact on the Company’s overall tax rate was to increase the Company’s provision for
income taxes by $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, decrease the Company’s provision
for income taxes by $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and decrease the Company’s
provision for income taxes by $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2022,
the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $92.1 million. Of this amount, $78.8
million may be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $13.3 million of net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023.

119In October 2020, the Company completed an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets between
certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries to better align its international structure with its expanding
operations. The transfer resulted in a step-up of the tax-deductible basis in the transferred assets in a
foreign jurisdiction, and created a temporary difference between the tax basis and book basis for such
intangible assets. The Company recognized deferred tax assets of approximately $165.1 million, with a
corresponding reduction to the provision for income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2020 in its
consolidated financial statements. The tax deductions for the amortization of the deferred tax assets will
be recognized in the future and any amortization not deducted for tax purposes will be carried forward
indefinitely. The tax impact on the foreign subsidiary transferor was not material.
The following is a roll-forward of the Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits, not
including interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:
    Gross Unrecognized Tax

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the
provision for income taxes in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had accrued approximately $0.4 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, it would not have a significant
impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.
It is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit change within the next
12 months will not be significant.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax in multiple state and
foreign jurisdictions.
The Company is in various stages of examination with certain states and certain foreign
jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Company’s 2019 through 2021 U.S. federal
income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS. The Company’s state income tax returns are
subject to examination for the 2018 through 2021 tax years.

20.        SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has four operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment,
which is primarily comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high
performance energy drinks, Monster® Tour WaterTM and True North® Pure Energy Seltzers, (ii) Strategic
Brands segment, which is primarily comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC in
2015 as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, (iii) Alcohol Brands segment, which is primarily
comprised of the various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy Transaction on
February 17, 2022 as well as The Beast UnleashedTM FMBs and (iv) Other segment, which is comprised
of the AFF Third-Party Products.
The Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by
selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers/distributors. In some cases, the Company sells
ready-to-drink packaged drinks directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores,
mass merchandisers, convenience chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce
retailers and the military.
The Company’s Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling
“concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers
generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to
produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold
by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club
stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-
commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, the Strategic Brands segment generates net
operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.

revenues, but lower per case gross profit margin percentages than the Strategic Brands segment.
The Company’s Alcohol Brands segment primarily generates operating revenues by selling
kegged and ready-to-drink canned beers, hard seltzers and FMBs primarily to beer distributors in the
United States.
Generally, the Alcohol Brands segment will have lower gross profit margin percentages than the
Monster Energy® Drinks segment.
Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to a reportable segment have been allocated
to “Corporate & Unallocated.” No asset information, other than goodwill and other intangible assets, has
been provided in the Company’s reportable segments, as management does not measure or allocate such
assets on a segment basis.
