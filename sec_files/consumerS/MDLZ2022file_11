PART I
Item 1. Business.
General
Mondelēz International’s purpose is to empower people to snack right. We sell our products in over 150 countries
around the world. We are one of the world’s largest snack companies with global net revenues of $28.7 billion and net
earnings of $4.3 billion in 2021. We make and sell primarily snacks, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted
snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, as well as various cheese & grocery and powdered beverage products. Our portfolio
includes snack brands such as Cadbury, Milka and Toblerone chocolate; Oreo, belVita and LU biscuits; Halls candy;
Trident gum and Tang powdered beverages.
We strive to create a positive impact on the world and communities in which we operate while driving business
performance. Our goal is to lead the future of snacking around the world by offering the right snack, for the right
moment, made the right way. We aim to deliver a broad range of delicious, high-quality snacks that nourish life’s
moments, made with sustainable ingredients and packaging that consumers can feel good about. We remain
committed to driving longstanding and enduring positive change in the world.
Mondelēz International at a Glance
Strategy
We aim to be the global leader in snacking by focusing on growth, execution and culture. Our strategic plan builds on
our strong foundations, including our unique portfolio of iconic global and local brands, our attractive global footprint,
our market leadership in developed and emerging markets, our deep innovation, marketing and distribution capabilities,
and our profit dollar expansion in recent years that allows us to make ongoing investments in our brands and
capabilities.
Our plan to drive long-term growth includes three strategic priorities:
•Accelerate consumer-centric growth. Our consumers are the reason we want to be the best snacking company
in the world, and we put them at the heart of everything we do. With our consumers in mind, we are focused on
accelerating growth by investing in both our global and local brands. We are working to implement innovative
ideas and programs, drive growth in new channels, and build and develop new and existing partnerships that
serve our consumers. As demands on consumers’ time increase and consumer eating habits evolve, we aim to
meet consumers' snacking needs. We plan to test, learn and scale new product offerings quickly to meet
diverse and evolving local and global snacking demand.
•Drive operational excellence. Our operational excellence and continuous improvement plans include a special
focus on the consumer-facing areas of our business and optimizing our sales, marketing and customer service
efforts. To drive productivity gains and cost improvements across our business, we also
3
Table of Contents
plan to continue leveraging our global shared services platform, driving greater efficiencies in our supply chain
and applying strong cost discipline across our operations. We expect the improvements and efficiencies we
drive will fuel our growth and continue to expand profit dollars. At the same time, we are continuing our efforts
to sustainably source key ingredients, reduce our end-to-end environmental impact and innovate our processes
and packaging to reduce waste and promote recycling.
•Build a winning growth culture. To support the acceleration of our growth, we are becoming more agile, digital
and local-consumer focused. We are committed to investing in a diverse and talented workforce that helps our
business move forward with greater speed and agility. We empower our local teams to innovate and deliver
consumers’ snacking needs while continuing to leverage our global scale to efficiently support our growth
strategy. We have given our local teams more autonomy to drive commercial and innovation plans as they are
closer to the needs and desires of consumers. We will continue to leverage the efficiency and scale of our
regional operating units while empowering our local and commercial operations to respond faster to changing
consumer preferences and capitalize on growth opportunities. Our digital transformation program will also help
to enable consumer demand and sales opportunities. We believe our commitment to diversity, equity and
inclusion and operating and cultural shifts to continue building a winning growth culture will help drive profitable
top-line growth.
We run our business with a long-term perspective, and we believe the successful delivery of our strategic plan will drive
top- and bottom-line growth and enable us to create long-term value for our shareholders.
In addition, we also continue to focus significant efforts to drive progress against our core initiatives for more
sustainable and mindful snacking. For the last several years, we have been following the principles of the Science
Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) as we continued to measure our greenhouse gas footprint, worked to reduce our
emissions and accelerated our existing sustainability initiatives to become a more sustainable snacking company. In
November 2021, we set a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain (including Scope 1
through 3 greenhouse gas emissions) by 2050. We have signed the SBTi’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C, aligning our
long-term emissions mitigation goals with the aim of limiting temperature rise in accordance with the Paris Agreement,
the 2015 international treaty on climate change. We also joined the United Nations Race to Zero campaign to help build
momentum toward a decarbonized economy. These goals are a strategic priority and help guide us as we continue our
sustainability work to drive lasting progress at scale and create long-term value for the business and our stakeholders.
We continue to report on our progress in our annual Snacking Made Right report, where we discuss our performance
against our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) goals and initiatives. Please also see our Sustainability and
Mindful Snacking section below.
In 2020 and 2021, while the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected economies, marketplaces, communities and
businesses around the world, including ours, we prioritized our employees, customers and communities and largely
continued to execute against our strategic priorities. In this way, we positioned ourselves to emerge stronger. Please
refer to our COVID-19 discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for more information.
Global Operations
We sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, including 131
manufacturing and processing facilities across 45 countries. The portion of our net revenues generated outside the
United States was 75.1% in 2021, 73.2% in 2020 and 74.4% in 2019. For more information on our U.S. and non-U.S.
operations, refer to Note 18, Segment Reporting; on our manufacturing and other facilities, refer to Item 2, Properties;

Operating Segments
Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:
•Latin America
•AMEA
•Europe
•North America
We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business
environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional
management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.
We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is
appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. For a definition and
reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pre-tax earnings as well as other information on our
segments, see Note 18, Segment Reporting.

Chocolate - Tablets, bars and other 32 % 31 % 32 %
Seasonality
Demand for our products is generally balanced over the second and third quarters of the year and increases in the first
and fourth quarters primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events. Depending on the timing of Easter, the
holiday sales may shift between and affect net revenue in the first and second quarter.
Customers
We generally sell our products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers,
distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We also sell
products directly to businesses and consumers through various pure play e-retail platforms, retailer digital platforms,
our Direct to Consumer websites and social media platforms.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2021. Our five largest
customers accounted for 16.7% and our ten largest customers accounted for 23.0% of net revenues from continuing
operations in 2021. For a discussion of long-term demographics, consumer trends and demand, refer to our Financial
Outlook within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Distribution and Marketing
We distribute our products through direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers,
third party distributors and other facilities. We use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our
international locations. Through our global digital commerce organization and capabilities, we pursue online growth with
partners in key markets around the world, including both pure e-tailers and omni-channel retailers. We continue to
invest in advertising and consumer promotions, talent and digital capabilities. Our digital commerce channel strategies
play a critical role in our ambition to be the global leader in snacking.
We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing and advertising including
digital and social media, on-air, print, outdoor and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as
coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our
products by our customers.

Research, Development and Innovation
We work to understand consumer needs and deliver snacks with consistent quality and taste. We continue to invest in
a global network of technical centers to research and support our growth while continuing to innovate our processes.
Our innovation and new product development objectives include continuous improvement in food safety and quality,
growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced production costs. Our innovation efforts
focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. We work to test-and-learn
new ideas and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. Mindful snacking and sustainability are a
significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. We work to introduce new varieties of our core
products, including new taste or nutrition profiles based on consumer preferences, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk
chocolate bars with 30% less sugar, Sugar-free Oreos and the Cadbury Plant Bar, a vegan (100% plant-based)
sustainably-sourced cocoa chocolate bar wrapped in plant-based packaging. We aim to address consumer needs and
market trends and leverage scalable innovation platforms, sustainability programs and breakthrough technologies in
order to delight our consumers and fuel our growth. We are focusing our technical research and development
resources at 12 technical centers around the globe to drive growth, creativity, greater effectiveness, improved efficiency
and accelerated project delivery.
We also have a dedicated innovation and venture hub, SnackFutures, which is designed to capitalize on consumer
trends and emerging growth opportunities in well-being snacks. The group’s priorities support incremental growth
against three key strategic areas: invent new brands and businesses, invest in early stage entrepreneurs, and amplify
SnackFutures’ impact with the CoLab start-up engagement program built to provide start-ups with tools, technologies
and expertise that can help them learn, grow and succeed.
Competition
We face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local
and regional companies, including new start-up brands and businesses. Some competitors have different profit
objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions
differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste,
convenience, nutritional value, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of digital and other
sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. Growing our market
share or introducing a new product requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional
expenditures. We believe these investments lead to better products and stronger brands for the consumer and support
our growth and market position.
Raw Materials and Packaging
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, palm and other vegetable oils,
sugar and other sweeteners, flavoring agents and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of
packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses.
We monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can sustainably and cost-effectively secure
ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production.
A number of external factors such as changing weather patterns and conditions, commodity market conditions, effects
from the current COVID-19 global pandemic, supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations and the effects of
governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials
used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher
pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in
the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes,
and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.
Due to factors noted above, the costs of our principal raw materials can fluctuate. During late 2021 in particular,
commodity costs have primarily increased due to recent supply chain disruptions. We expect commodity cost volatility
to continue, and our commodity hedging activities cannot fully offset this volatility. Despite the recent and expected
supply chain, transportation and labor disruptions, at this time, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply
of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available. However, we continue to monitor the near-
term and long-term impacts of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, climate change and related factors that could
affect the availability or cost of raw materials, packaging and energy. For additional information,

Human Capital
We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global company that
leads with purpose. All our employees contribute to our success and help us drive strong financial performance.
Attracting, developing and retaining global talent with the right skills to drive our business is central to our purpose,
mission and long-term growth strategy.
Workforce Profile: Consistent with 2020, at December 31, 2021, we had approximately 79,000 employees. At
December 31, 2021, we had approximately 11,000 U.S. employees and approximately 68,000 employees outside the
United States, with employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils representing approximately 28% of our
U.S. employees and approximately 61% of our employees outside the United States.
Workplace Safety and Wellness: We promote a strong culture of safety and prioritize keeping all our employees,
contractors and visitors safe. To accomplish this, we employ comprehensive health, safety and environment
management policies and standards throughout the organization. In addition, we strive to continuously improve our
work processes, tools and metrics to reduce workplace injuries and enhance safety.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented strict health and safety protocols and taken appropriate
measures in our facilities, including implementing temperature screening, social distancing, mask-wearing and work-
from-home policies where applicable. As local governments began planning their vaccine rollout programs, we
developed and deployed a three-phased vaccine advocacy strategy to understand intent, drive interest and secure
vaccine availability for our colleagues all around the world. We will continue to employ a flexible approach to how and
where we work for our office-based employees, focusing on new ways of working in the workplace that enables
colleagues to work remotely when appropriate and evolves our office spaces to foster great connection and
collaboration.
Culture and Employee Engagement: We conduct confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce that are
administered and analyzed by an independent third party. Aggregate survey results are reviewed by executive officers
and the Board of Directors. We create action plans at global, regional, functional and managerial levels. By acting on
results both at an aggregate enterprise level and a department/business/work group level, we have been able to
enhance our culture and improve our overall engagement.
We believe this reflects our ongoing efforts during the pandemic to focus on our employees, their well-being and the
issues that matter to them. In 2021, we had over 12,000 colleagues actively participating in training that supported their
well-being and provided them with new tools and resources to support remote work. We also launched initiatives to
further agile ways of working and streamline decision-making processes to enhance productivity and employee
engagement. We continue to build a winning growth culture and continue our commitment to work on the areas that
matter to our people and build on our momentum.
Total Rewards: As part of our total rewards philosophy, we offer competitive compensation and benefits to attract and
retain top talent. Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and talent strategy as well
as drive a strong connection between the contributions of our employees and their pay. We believe the structure of our
compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. Further, to
foster a strong sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, we grant stock-based
incentives to most senior-level employees.
We also continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs. We provide access to
medical and welfare benefits and offer programs to all employees that support work-life balance, including paid parental
leave, as well as financial, physical and mental health resources.
We are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics.
To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors
such as an employee’s role and experience, job location and performance. We also regularly review our compensation
practices to promote fair and equitable pay.

With the support of an independent third-party expert in this field, we conduct global pay equity reviews for salaried
employees comparing employees in the same pay grade within a country/area to help identify any unsupported
distinctions in pay between employees of different genders and races (as permitted by local country law).
Our last global analysis in 2021 encompassed 81 countries and over 32,000 employees. From this analysis, we noted
our pay gap between male and female employees was less than 1%. We anticipate this gap will further decrease
through pay adjustments for employees identified during the review. In the United States, we also review pay for
salaried employees in the same pay grade by race/ethnicity (Asian, Black and Hispanic). The 2021 independent
analysis found no systemic issues and no negative pay gap between non-white and white employees.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion: Diversity, equity & inclusion (“DE&I”) significantly contributes to our winning growth culture.
We work to reflect the diversity of ideas and people in our world and to maximize the power and potential of our
employees.
In addition, we have many communities and sponsored programs tailored for our diverse workforce, including those
that foster gender and race equality. At the end of 2021, women held 39.3% of global management roles (defined as
Director and above) and 27.3% of executive leadership roles (defined as the Management Leadership Team plus one
level below). In September 2020, we announced our goal to double Black representation in our U.S. management team
by 2024, and we are exceeding our expected annual progress toward that goal. For our U.S. leadership, Black
employees held 5.1% of management roles (defined as Director and above) at the end of 2021 and 3.2% at the end of
2020.
Our DE&I commitment is led from the top and driven throughout the organization by our Management Leadership
Team, Board of Directors and Mondelēz Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Steering Committee. As an important step in our
DE&I journey, we established a team, including C-suite officers and other key senior leaders, charged with collectively
setting the strategy and DE&I commitments across the organization.
We also include specific DE&I metrics as a part of the strategic scorecard within our annual incentive plan for our CEO
and other senior leaders. The scorecard is used consistently across the Company at both the corporate and region
level and is linked directly to the three pillars of our strategy – growth, execution and culture.
As a global employer, we recognize and value differences and are championing DE&I around the world. We are
creating local and global opportunities to further racial equity and economic empowerment by expanding our DE&I
initiatives across three key areas: colleagues, culture and communities. These opportunities include mobilizing our
consumer-facing brands and leveraging our partnerships with agencies and advertising platforms to drive change,
equity and inclusion.
Talent Management and Development: Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and is a
key aspect of succession planning efforts across the organization. Our leadership and people teams are responsible for
attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in
their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by reviewing strategic
positions regularly and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those roles, evaluating job skill sets to identify
competency gaps and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We invest in our
employees through training and development programs, on the job experiences, coaching, as well as tuition
reimbursement for a majority of our employees in the United States to promote continued professional growth. We
provide technical and leadership programs across the organization that enable colleagues to grow skills and
capabilities to become more successful. We also have dedicated talent programs that support and accelerate
leadership development and strengthen our succession plans. Additionally, we understand the importance of
maintaining competitive compensation, benefits and appropriate training that provides growth, developmental
opportunities and multiple career paths within the Company.

May 2022.

Sustainability and Mindful Snacking
Our mission is to lead the future of snacking by creating snacks the right way for both people and planet. We are
focused on making our snacks more sustainably by using ingredients consumers know and trust, using less energy and
water and creating less waste. Our mindful snacking strategy aims to encourage consumers to snack with moderation
through portion control offerings and portion size labeling, and we continue to evolve our portfolio to meet consumers’
needs. We have specific goals and continue to make progress and scale our efforts to deliver meaningful change. By
living our purpose to empower people to snack right, we believe we can continue to have a positive impact on the lives
of our consumers and the world around us.
We have been focused on sustainability for many years and are committed to making a meaningful difference,
including in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. In our end-to-end assessment of our supply chain from suppliers
to consumers, raw ingredient sourcing (including primarily cocoa, dairy, wheat, palm and other vegetable oils) and
related land use is the predominant contributor to our Scope 1 through 3 estimated greenhouse gas emissions. We
have been continuing to work to reduce emissions and in November 2021, we announced our goal of net zero
greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain (including Scope 1 through 3 greenhouse gas emissions) by
2050.
“Net zero emissions” refers to achieving a balance between greenhouse gas emissions released through human
activities and those removed from the atmosphere. Getting to net zero emissions means we plan to reduce our
greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with SBTi mitigation pathways, using low-carbon technologies and
agricultural practices. In line with the SBTi net zero protocol, we would then neutralize the impact of any residual
emissions that cannot be eliminated by permanently removing an equivalent amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide,
such as through certified greenhouse gas emission reduction projects and sequestration. To date, we have not focused
on using carbon credits or similar instruments, and our priority is to continue to reduce our emissions in line with the
SBTi protocol. Our strategies could change over time through 2050 as new emission reduction options become
available.
As we work to accomplish these goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain, we are focused
on helping to expand the use of regenerative agricultural methods, preserve forested protected lands, conserve
resources such as water and energy and foster safe and equitable workplaces and communities. We continue to
expand our raw material sourcing programs, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony for wheat, and leverage our
supplier relationships and industry-sector coalitions to promote the use of new agricultural methods and technologies
and tools focused on improving yields and reducing related greenhouse gas emissions. Within our operations, we plan
to increase our use of low-carbon technology to reduce emissions and increase our use of renewable energy. We also
plan to invest in low-carbon solutions as we replace ovens and refrigerants and increase our use of recycled plastic and
other types of packaging materials.
In addition to our 2050 net zero greenhouse gas emissions goal, our 2025 sustainability and mindful snacking goals
include:
•Reducing food waste in manufacturing, end-to-end CO emissions and priority water usage
•Designing all packaging to be recyclable
•Scaling our Cocoa Life sustainability program so that Cocoa Life will produce 100% of the cocoa volume we
require for our chocolate brands
•Growing portion control products to 20% of snacks net revenues
•Including mindful snacking portion information on all packages globally by 2025
In September 2021, we issued our first green bonds, raising nearly €2.0 billion or approximately $2.4 billion, further
enabling us to cost-effectively fund eligible projects that align with our sustainability priorities in the areas of building a
thriving ingredient supply chain and reducing our environmental impact.
The Governance, Membership and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our environmental and
social sustainability and well-being initiatives. Our ESG goals are part of our strategic planning process and are also
embedded across our organization and within our annual incentive compensation program for our leadership. Our
businesses and senior leaders work to deliver progress that is regularly reviewed with business leadership teams and
our Board of Directors.2e

Table of Contents
We discuss our ESG goals and programs in detail in our annual Snacking Made Right ESG report available on our
website. Under Snacking Made Right - Reporting and Disclosure, we also publish an ESG disclosure data sheet that
outlines our alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) reporting frameworks. We also provide our CDP Climate Change, Water Security and
Forests annual disclosures.
We have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. Each year since we
created Mondelēz International in 2012 we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (“DJSI”) – World
and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American
companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We are at the
96th percentile of our industry according to the latest DJSI report issued in November 2021.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets,
recipes, technology and know-how) are material to our business.
We own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks
remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally
are renewable for fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover
inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products
themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and
the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by
a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as
determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our
patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a
material adverse effect on our business.
From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary
trade secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third-party products. Similarly, we sell some
products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with
Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various
licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off
of our North American grocery business in 2012.
Regulation
Our food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health
and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, data privacy and related areas. In addition, various
jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing
standards for select food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing
of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural
policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic
governmental and administrative review. In addition, increased attention to environmental and social issues in industry
supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries. The lack of a harmonized approach
can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement, which can impact our operations.
Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include workplace safety regulations; selective food taxes;
labeling requirements such as front-of-pack labeling based on nutrient profiles or environmental claims; sales or media
and marketing restrictions such as those on promotions or advertising products with specified nutrient profiles on
certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day; sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials; cross-
border trade concessions or border barriers; corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; and
packaging taxes. In addition, over 25 countries in the European Union have implemented extended producer
responsibility (“EPR”) policies as part of national packaging waste policies that make manufacturers responsible for the
cost of recycling food and beverage packaging after consumers use it. These range from mandatory regulations to
voluntary agreements between government and industry to voluntary industry initiatives. EPR policies are being
implemented or contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including India, Vietnam and certain states in the
United States. Single-use plastic bans and other plastic taxes are being considered in Europe as well as countries
including Indonesia and the Philippines.

Throughout the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multinational environmental
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units
designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations
include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. We are also subject to legislation designed to reduce
emissions from greenhouse gases, and many countries are considering introducing carbon taxes that could increase
our production costs or those of our suppliers.
We continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. Also refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, for additional information on government regulations
and currency-related impacts on our operations in the United Kingdom, Argentina and other countries.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
You should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties when evaluating our
business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and
consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results,
liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting
our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties
that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse
effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future.
Strategic and Operational Risks
Global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, could negatively impact our business
operations, financial performance and results of operations.
Our business and financial results could be negatively impacted by COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics. The
severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain and hard to predict. Since 2020,
COVID-19 has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and it could negatively impact
our business in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below:
•In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower revenues in some of our emerging market countries that
have a greater concentration of traditional trade outlets (such as small family-run stores), as well as in our
world travel retail (such as international duty-free stores) and foodservice businesses and categories like gum
and candy, which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home. Some of these parts of our
business continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic, and some of these areas such as gum
that grew in 2021 have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We are unable to predict how long these
trends will continue or whether they will worsen.
•In 2020 and 2021, sales of some of our products in some markets and channels increased, such as products
for in-home consumption and categories like biscuits, as well as the modern trade and digital commerce
channels. We are unable to predict how long this sustained demand will last. Different markets and parts of our
business will recover from the COVID-19 pandemic at different rates depending on many factors including
vaccination levels or new COVID-19 variants and related outbreaks within a market.
•The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could materially disrupt our global supply chain, operations and
routes to market or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, our external manufacturing partners, distributors or
other business partners. Disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them have increased and could in
the future increase product or distribution costs or cause delays in delivering or an inability to deliver products
to our customers. For example, we experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging
markets such as India and Nigeria in the first half of 2020 and Vietnam in 2021.
•The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in broader supply, transportation and labor disruptions resulting in
inflation and generally higher operating costs in our business. In 2021, we experienced labor disruptions
primarily in our North America region, which impacted our sales in the fourth quarter. We also experienced
labor-related disruptions in our network of third-party logistics and external manufacturing, and we anticipate
labor shortage-related issues will continue in 2022. As a result of incremental pandemic-related expenditures
and labor disruptions, we incurred and expect to continue to incur higher labor costs, particularly as the
pandemic continues.
14
Table of Contents
•Commodity and transportation costs have become more volatile and generally increased due to the COVID-19
pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and transportation and labor shortages. We expect commodity cost
volatility to continue, and our commodity hedging activities cannot fully offset this volatility.
•Further disruptions or uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in delays or modifications to
our strategic plans and initiatives.
•Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism or other workforce disruptions have affected and could materially
negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution or other business processes. The pandemic has
also necessitated increased expenditures to secure the safety and effectiveness of our personnel and
operations.
•Government or regulatory responses to pandemics could negatively impact our business. Mandatory
lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in some countries temporarily disrupted our ability to distribute
our products in some markets. Resumption, continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially
adversely impact our operations and results.
•Initially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. dollar appreciated materially against other currencies in the
countries in which we operate, resulting in currency translation losses. If the U.S. dollar were to appreciate
again against some or all of those same currencies, the resulting currency translation losses, along with
currency transaction losses, could adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.
•The COVID-19 outbreak initially increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and commercial paper
markets, and volatility may increase again as COVID-19 evolves. We might not be able to continue to access
preferred sources of liquidity when we would like or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs
could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise
capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative
counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital
and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts.
These and other impacts of the COVID-19 or other global or regional health pandemics or epidemics could have the
effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors below, including but not limited to those
relating to our reputation, brands, consumer preferences, supply chain, product sales, results of operations or financial
condition. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term
adverse impacts to our results. The ultimate impact of these disruptions also depends on events beyond our knowledge
or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and other pandemics or epidemics and actions taken by
parties other than us to respond to them, and in the case of COVID-19, on the emergence and spread of COVID-19
variants including Omicron. Any of these disruptions could have a negative impact on our business operations, financial
performance, results of operations and stock price, and this impact could be material. Additionally, COVID-19 may also
materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position in a manner that is not currently known to us or
that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.
We operate in a highly competitive industry and we face risks related to the execution of our strategy and our
timely response to channel shifts and pricing and other competitive pressures.
The food and snacking industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include food, snack and beverage
companies that operate in multiple geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies. Failure to effectively
respond to challenges from our competitors could adversely affect our business.
Competitor and customer pressures require that we timely and effectively respond to changes in distribution channels
and technological developments that may require changes in our prices. These pressures could affect our ability to
increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively and timely assess new or
developing trends, technological advancements or changes in distribution methods and set proper pricing, including as
a result of inflation, or effective trade incentives could negatively impact demand for our products, our operating results,
achievement of our strategic and financial goals and our ability to capitalize on new revenue or value-producing
opportunities. The rapid growth of some channels, such as discounters as well as digital commerce which has
expanded significantly following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact our current operations or strategies
more quickly than we planned for, create consumer price deflation, alter the buying behavior of consumers or disrupt
our retail customer relationships. We may need to increase or reallocate spending on existing and new distribution
channels and technologies, marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase revenues, market
share and brand significance. These expenditures may not be successful, including those related to our digital
commerce and other technology-focused efforts, and might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts,
which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial

condition, results of operations and cash flows. We will be disadvantaged if we are not able to effectively leverage
developing channels such as direct-to-consumer and electronic business-to-business commerce. New distribution
channels, as well as growing opportunities to utilize external manufacturers, lower barriers to entry and allow smaller
competitors to more effectively gain market share. Additionally, if we adjust pricing but cannot maintain or increase
sales volumes, or our labor or other costs increase but we cannot increase prices to offset those changes, our financial
condition and results of operations will suffer.
During 2021, we continued to operate under our strategy, which focuses on accelerating consumer-centric and volume-
driven growth; operational excellence driven by cost discipline, simplification and continuous operational improvement
including in areas like sales execution; and building a winning growth culture with a “local first” commercial approach.
We have developed an approach to ESG that we believe supports our strategy and is focused on four areas: safety,
supply security, our environmental footprint and consumer well-being. If our strategy is not effective, we fail to achieve
our goals and objectives or identify or prioritize the areas most important to achieving our goals, or we fail to effectively
operate under our strategy in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business, it could materially and adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
Promoting and protecting our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success.
Our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands, expand to new geographies and new
distribution platforms such as digital commerce, and evolve our portfolio with new product offerings that meet consumer
needs and expectations.
We seek to strengthen our brands through investments in our product quality, product renovation, innovation and
marketing investments, including consumer-relevant advertising, digital transformation and consumer promotions.
Failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on well-being, including changing consumer acceptance of
certain ingredients, industrial manufacturing and processing, nutritional expectations of our products, and the
sustainability of our ingredients, our supply chain and our packaging (including plastic packaging and its ability to be
recycled and other environmental impacts) could adversely affect our brands. Increased negative attention from the
media, academics and online influencers, governments, shareholders and other stakeholders in these areas as well as
on the role of food marketing and other environmental, social, human capital or governance practices could adversely
affect our brand image. Undue caution or our failure to react timely in addressing these challenges and trends could
weaken our competitive position. Such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations, industry self-regulation that is
unevenly adopted among companies, and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices. Increasing and
disparate legal or regulatory restrictions on our labeling, advertising and consumer promotions, or our response to
those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. This includes regulations such as
front-of-pack labeling; selective food taxes; and age-based restrictions on sales of products with certain nutritional
profiles enacted in some states in Mexico. In the United Kingdom, a ban on specific types of TV and online advertising
of food containing levels of fat, sugar or salt above specified thresholds is expected to go into effect in 2023, and new
measures restricting certain promotions and in-store placement of some of those products are expected to go into
effect in October 2022. Moreover, adverse publicity, regulatory developments or legal action against us, our employees
or our licensees related to product quality and safety, where and how we manufacture our products, environmental
risks including climate change, human and workplace rights across our supply chain, labor relations, or antitrust, anti-
bribery and anti-corruption compliance could damage our reputation and brand health. Such actions could undermine
our customers’ and shareholders’ confidence and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action
is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations. Our product sponsorship relationships, including those
with celebrity spokespersons, influencers or group affiliations, could also subject us to negative publicity.
In addition, our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and
adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on established and
emerging social media and online platforms, digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns,
targeted marketing and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. A variety of legal and
regulatory restrictions as well as our own policies and participation in industry self-regulation initiatives limit how and to
whom we market our products. These restrictions may limit our brand renovation, innovation, marketing and promotion
plans, particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve. We might also fail to
sufficiently evolve our digital marketing efforts to effectively utilize consumer data. Negative posts or comments about
Mondelēz International, our brands or our employees on social media or web sites (whether factual or not) or security
breaches related to use of our social media accounts and failure to respond
16
Table of Contents
effectively to these posts, comments or activities could damage our reputation and brand image across the various
regions in which we operate. Our brands may be associated with or appear alongside harmful content before these
platforms or our own social media monitoring can detect this risk to our brand. In addition, we might fail to invest
sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brands, our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results
and we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill. Third
parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. When consumers
confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, they might
refrain from purchasing our brands in the future, which could harm our brand image and sales. Third parties might also
improperly use our brands as part of phishing or other scams, which could negatively affect our brand image. Failure to
successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health could materially and adversely affect our company
and product brands as well as our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
We must correctly predict, identify, interpret and meet changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer
new and improved products that meet those changes.
Consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to
predict, identify, interpret and meet the tastes, dietary habits, packaging, sales channel and other preferences of
consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences in the places and ways consumers
want to shop. There may be further shifts in the relative size of shopping channels in addition to the increasing role of
digital commerce for consumers. Our success relies upon managing this complexity to promote and bring our products
to consumers effectively. Moreover, weak economic conditions, inflation, equity market volatility or other factors, such
as global or local pandemics and severe or unusual weather events, affect consumer preferences and demand. We
have experienced continued evolution of lifestyles and consumption patterns, including increased demand for biscuits
and decreased demand for gum, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to offer and deliver products that
appeal to consumers or to correctly judge consumer demand for our products will impact our ability to meet our growth
targets, and our sales and market share could decrease and our profitability could suffer.
We must distinguish between short-term fads and trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. Our sales
can be adversely affected when we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences or category trends
will be long-term or we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy changing preferences. In addition,
because of our varied and geographically diverse consumer base, we must be responsive to local consumer needs,
including with respect to when and how consumers snack and their desire for premium or value offerings. We must also
provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences and use marketing and
advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message. Demand for our products could decrease and
our profitability could suffer if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, rapidly
develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories or reach consumers in efficient and effective ways
leveraging data and analytics.
Negative perceptions concerning the health, environmental and social implications of certain food products, ingredients,
packaging materials, and sourcing or production methods could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of
some of our products and marketing programs. For example, consumers have increasingly focused on well-being,
including reducing sodium and added sugar consumption, as well as the source and authenticity of ingredients in the
foods they consume. Continuing to expand our well-being offerings and refining the ingredient and nutrition profiles of
existing products is important to our growth, as is maintaining focus on ethical sourcing and supply chain management
opportunities to address evolving consumer preferences. In addition, consumer preferences differ by region, and we
must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and other activities to respond to these regional preferences. We might
be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations.
Continued negative perceptions or failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our
reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
We are subject to risks from operating globally.
We are a global company and generated 75.1% of our 2021 net revenues, 73.2% of our 2020 net revenues and 74.4%
of our 2019 net revenues outside the United States. We manufacture and market our products in over 150 countries
and have operations in approximately 80 countries. Therefore, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations.
Those risks include: 
17
Table of Contents
•compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);
•the imposition of increased or new tariffs, sanctions, quotas, trade barriers, price floors or similar restrictions on
our sales or key commodities like cocoa, potential changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with
other countries, or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales or profitability;
•compliance with antitrust and competition laws, trade laws, data privacy laws, anti-bribery laws, human rights
laws and a variety of other local, national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes;
•currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values, including in developing markets such as Argentina,
Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa and Pakistan as well as in
developed markets such as the United Kingdom and countries within the European Union. This includes events
like applying highly inflationary accounting as we did for our Argentinean subsidiaries beginning in July 2018;
•changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits
on our ability to import raw materials or finished products into various countries or repatriate cash from outside
the United States;
•increased sovereign risk, such as defaults by or deterioration in the economies and credit ratings of
governments, particularly in our Latin America and AMEA regions;
•changes or inconsistencies in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in non-
U.S. jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of
property or other resources;
•varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;
•discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;
•greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and
•design, implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and
employee base.
In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest,
civil strife, acts of war, government shutdowns, travel or immigration restrictions, tariffs and other trade restrictions,
public health risks or pandemics including COVID-19, energy policy or restrictions, public corruption, expropriation and
other economic or political uncertainties, including inaccuracies in our assumptions about these factors, could interrupt
and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. High unemployment or the slowdown in economic
growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending. Declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss
of market share and adversely impact our profitability. Continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of
certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the separation of the United Kingdom’s from the
European Union (“Brexit”) could have a negative effect on our business. (See below and Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Outlook – Brexit for more information.) The
nature and degree of the various risks we face can also differ significantly among our regions and businesses.
All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our
product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, stock price, and our relationships with customers,
suppliers and employees in the short or long term.
Our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks.
Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets, including among
others Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, Argentina, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia.
However, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to
infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. In many countries, particularly those with emerging
economies, engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the
FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, or local anti-bribery laws may be more common. These laws generally prohibit
companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials,
including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business. Failure to comply
with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation,
financial condition, results of operations and stock price.
In addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low-cost
local manufacturers improve and expand their production capacities. Our success in emerging markets is critical to
achieving our growth strategy. Failure to successfully increase our business in emerging markets and
18
Table of Contents
manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
Our use of information technology and third-party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and
other business disruptions.
We use information technology and third-party service providers to support our global business processes and
activities, including supporting critical business operations such as manufacturing and distribution; communicating with
our suppliers, customers and employees; maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure
controls; executing mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions; conducting research and development
activities; meeting regulatory, legal and tax requirements; and executing various digital marketing and consumer
promotion activities. Global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing number of services
important to conducting our business, including accounting, internal control, human resources and computing functions.
Continuity of business applications and services has been, and may in the future be, disrupted by events such as
infection by viruses or malware, including the June 2017 malware incident that affected a significant portion of our
global sales, distribution and financial networks (the “2017 malware incident”); other cybersecurity attacks; issues with
or errors in systems’ maintenance or security; power outages; hardware or software failures; denial of service attacks;
telecommunication failures; natural disasters; terrorist attacks; and other catastrophic occurrences. Our use of new and
emerging technologies such as cloud-based services and mobile applications continues to evolve, presenting new and
additional risks in managing access to our data, relying on third parties to manage and safeguard data, ensuring
access to our systems and availability of third-party systems. In addition, we are experiencing new and more frequent
attempts by third parties to gain access to our systems, such as through increased email phishing of our workforce.
Cybersecurity breaches of our or third-party systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service
attacks or other cyberattacks such as hacking, phishing attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee
or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information
belonging to us or our employees, customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, or governmental or regulatory authorities
to be misused or breached. These risks could be magnified given the increased number of employees, contractors and
others working outside of offices during the COVID-19 pandemic. When risks such as these materialize, the need for us
to coordinate with various third-party service providers and for third-party service providers to coordinate amongst
themselves might increase challenges and costs to resolve related issues. Additionally, new initiatives, such as those
related to digital commerce and direct sales, that increase the amount of confidential information that we process and
maintain increase our potential exposure to a cybersecurity breach. If our controls, disaster recovery and business
continuity plans or those of our third-party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any
such disruptions in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, results of operations and stock price may be
materially and adversely affected, and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results, loss of intellectual
property and damage to our reputation or brands.
We continue to devote focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and
other security measures to protect our systems and data, such as advanced email protection to reduce the likelihood of
credential thefts and electronic fraud attempts. We also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in
our environment, including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies, as well as
adjusting information security controls based on the updated threat. However, security measures cannot provide
absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a
timely basis. Due to the constantly evolving and complex nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and
impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing
protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly.
We transfer data across local, regional, and national borders to conduct our operations, and we are subject to a variety
of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy, data
protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and
security of personal data. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. The European Union’s General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018 and has greatly increased the
19
Table of Contents
jurisdictional reach of E.U. law, added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public
disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for non-compliance of up to 4% of global
annual revenue for the preceding financial year in addition to potential restrictions on data transfer and processing. The
California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective in January 2020, requires greater transparency in
handling personal information from consumers by imposing new responsibilities for the handling, disclosure and
deletion of personal information for consumers. The CCPA permits California to assess potentially significant fines for
violating CCPA and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations.
Regulations to implement the CCPA were finalized in August 2020. In addition, new privacy regulations, such as the
California Privacy Rights Act, which grants a private right of action to individuals, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection
Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, will enter into effect in 2023. Our efforts to comply with multijurisdictional privacy and
data protection laws and the uncertainty of new laws and regulations will likely increase the complexity of our
processes and may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur
substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.
We are subject to risks from unanticipated business disruptions.
We manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. We utilize an interdependent supply chain – a
complex network of suppliers and material needs, owned and leased manufacturing locations, external manufacturing
partners, distribution networks, shared service delivery centers and information systems that support our ability to
provide our products to our customers consistently. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like weather,
natural disasters, water and energy availability, supply and commodity shortages, terrorism, political unrest,
cybersecurity incidents, labor shortages, strikes, operational and/or financial instability of our key suppliers and other
vendors or service providers, government shutdowns or health pandemics such as COVID-19, including any potential
impact of climate change on these factors, could damage or disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers, their
suppliers, our external manufacturing partners, distributors or other business partners. Failure to effectively prepare for
and respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by not finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at
key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations or by not quickly repairing damage to our information, production or
supply systems, can cause delays in delivering or the inability to deliver products to our customers, as we experienced
in connection with the 2017 malware incident, and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected.
Moreover, disputes with significant customers or suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could
adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. The occurrence of a material or extended
disruption may cause us to lose our customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation,
and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. Some risks are difficult or impossible to insure through
the insurance programs we use to transfer many of these risks, and the timing of insurance recoveries may not match
the timing of our financial loss. We are subject to risk related to operational safety, including risk of fire, explosion or
accidental contamination. We could also fail to achieve our strategic objectives due to capability or technology
deficiencies related to our ongoing reconfiguration of our supply chain to drive efficiencies and fuel growth. Further, our
ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio
complexity, significant changes in trade policies, changes in volume produced and changes to regulatory restrictions or
labor-related or other constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate. These
events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and
stock price.
Commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of
commodities may become constrained.
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, wheat, palm oil, soy, dairy, other vegetable oils,
sugar and other sweeteners, flavoring agents and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of
product packaging materials, natural gas, fuel and electricity for our factories and warehouses, and we also incur
expenses in connection with labor and the transportation and delivery of our products. Costs of raw materials, energy
and other supplies and services are volatile and fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict. These conditions
include global competition for resources; currency fluctuations; geopolitical conditions or conflicts; tariffs or other trade
barriers; government intervention to introduce living income premiums or similar requirements such as those
announced in 2019 in two of the main cocoa-growing countries; changes in environmental or trade policy and
regulations, alternative energy and agricultural programs; severe weather; agricultural productivity; crop disease or
pests; water risk; health pandemics including COVID-19; forest fires; and consumer or industrial demand. Many of
these conditions are or could be exacerbated or worsened by climate change. Increased government intervention and
consumer or activist responses caused by increased focus on climate change,
20
Table of Contents
deforestation, water, plastic waste, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the
global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the
materials we need to operate our business. Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be
able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity
prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors
like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always
protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility
in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as
we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and
our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover
inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in
input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise,
constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we
experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of
2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are
unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products,
or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and
stock price can be materially adversely affected.
We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.
We regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures,
equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and
acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking
segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify,
complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability
to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive
necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate
or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic
transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business
relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of
customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic
partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management
attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.
With respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability
to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations
and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets;
manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with
antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet’s N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper
Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and
private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for
the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do,
or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter
might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits.
Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also
be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency
exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an
alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.
Furthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses
that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related
activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize
impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on
the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.
21

Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and stock price.
Macroeconomic and Industry Risks
Climate change might adversely impact our supply chain or our operations.
Scientific evidence collected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrates that carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns
around the globe that expose us to physical and transition risk. Physical risks include increasing frequency of extreme
weather events and natural disasters and effects on water availability and quality. These impacts increase risks to the
global food production and distribution system. Decreased agricultural productivity caused by climate change might
limit the availability of the commodities we purchase and use. These include cocoa, which is a critical raw material for
our chocolate and biscuit portfolios that is particularly sensitive to changes in climate, as well as other raw materials
such as dairy, wheat, vegetable oils, sugar and nuts. Weather events such as floods, severe storms or water shortages
that are partially caused or exacerbated by climate change might disrupt our business operations or those of our
suppliers, their suppliers, our external manufacturing partners, distributors or other business partners.
Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies globally regarding
environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and
sustainability, including single use plastics. New legal and regulatory requirements have increased and could continue
to increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging through taxes or regulations, including payments
under extended producer responsibility policies, taxes on specific packaging material types and targets to increase the
use of reuse/refill delivery models. Increasing regulation of carbon taxes could also substantially increase our product
supply chain and distribution costs. Concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to switch away
from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact and towards products that are more
sustainably grown and made, and we expect to incur additional costs as we evolve our portfolio and engage in due
diligence, verification and reporting in connection with our ESG and sustainability initiatives. We might not effectively
address increased attention from the media, shareholders, activists and other stakeholders on climate change and
related environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, water use and packaging, including
plastic. Those stakeholders might also have requests or proposals that are not aligned with the focus of our efforts on
climate change and ESG matters. Climate change-related impacts could also reduce demand for our products. If costs
for raw materials increase or availability decreases, we raise prices for our products and our competitors respond
differently to those cost or availability pressures, demand for our products and our market share could suffer. We have
also experienced decreased demand for chocolate during periods when temperatures are warmer.
In 2021, we announced our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Achieving this goal will require
significant transformation of our business, capital investment and the development of technology that might not
currently exist. We might incur significant additional expense or be required to recognize impairment charges in
connection with our efforts, and we might be unable to achieve our goal.
Any or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet the needs of our customers, reputation,
product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
Our retail customers are consolidating, and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete
against retailer and other economy brands.
Retail customers, such as supermarkets, discounters, digital commerce merchants, warehouse clubs and food
distributors in the European Union, the United States and other major markets, continue to consolidate, form buying
alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market, resulting in fewer, larger customers. Large retail
customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and
demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs or longer payment terms. Retail customers might also adopt
these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products,
which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels and has increased further in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. The growth of alternative online retail channels, such as direct-to-consumer and electronic business-to-
business, may adversely affect our relationships with our large retail and wholesale customers.
22
Table of Contents
In addition, larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced
inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our
products. Our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives,
particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers may
not buy our products if they perceive little difference between the quality or value of our products and those of retailer or
other economy brands. If consumers prefer or otherwise choose to purchase the retailer or other economy brands, we
can lose market share or sales volumes, or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings.
Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial
performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access
sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay
us for previous purchases.
Failure to effectively respond to retail consolidation, increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other
economy brands could materially and adversely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows and stock price.
We are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers, suppliers and distributors.
During 2021, our five largest customers accounted for 16.7% of our net revenues. There can be no assurance that our
customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past,
particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands. The loss
of or disruptions related to a significant customer could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of
products we sell to the customer. This could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
Disputes with significant customers, suppliers or distributors, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could
adversely affect our ability to supply or deliver products or operate our business and could materially and adversely
affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. The financial condition of our significant
customers and business partners are affected by events that are largely beyond our control such as the COVID-19
pandemic. New regulations can also affect our commercial practices and our relationship with customers, suppliers or
distributors. Deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers, suppliers or distributors or regulations
affecting our relationship with these parties could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
We may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce
or effectively manage changes in our workforce and respond to shifts in labor availability.
We must hire, retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. We compete to
hire new personnel with a variety of capabilities in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our
products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies. We could experience unplanned or increased
turnover of employees with key capabilities, or fail to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or
hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business. We could
also fail to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities that we need to continue to respond to
changing consumer and customer needs and grow our business, including skills in the areas of digital commerce and
marketing, data analytics, and procurement and supply chain expertise. Occurrence of any of these conditions could
deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness.
We are experiencing an increasingly tight and competitive labor market and could face unforeseen challenges in the
availability of labor, such as we have experienced since the outbreak of COVID-19. A sustained labor shortage or
increased turnover rates within our employee base caused by COVID-19 or related issues such as vaccine mandates,
or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, have led and in the future could lead to increased costs, such as
increased overtime to meet demand and increased wages to attract and retain employees. We have also been
negatively affected and could continue to be negatively affected by labor shortages or constraints experienced by our
partners, including our external manufacturing partners and freight providers. Failure to achieve and maintain a diverse
workforce and leadership team, compensate our employees competitively and fairly, maintain a safe and inclusive
environment or promote the well-being of our employees could affect our reputation and also result in lower
performance and an inability to retain valuable employees.
23
Table of Contents
We must address changes in, and that affect, our workforce and satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we
manage and compensate our employees. This includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or
workers’ councils, who represent approximately 61% of our 68,000 employees outside the United States and
approximately 28% of our 11,000 U.S. employees. Strikes such as the one we experienced in some of our U.S.
manufacturing and distribution facilities in 2021, work stoppages, or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or
those of our suppliers, distributors or other business partners, or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining
agreements, have in the past and may in the future cause disruptions to our supply chain, manufacturing or distribution
processes. Changes in immigration laws and policies or restrictions such as those imposed in connection with the
COVID-19 pandemic could make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. We could also fail to
effectively respond to evolving perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire,
including in response to changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, with respect to flexible working or other
matters.
These risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation, ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities
and overall business and meet the needs of our customers, product sales, financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows and stock price.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
We face risks related to complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many
countries in which we operate.
Our activities around the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various laws and regulations
govern food production, packaging and waste management, storage, distribution, sales, advertising, labeling and
marketing, as well as intellectual property, competition, antitrust, trade, labor, tax and environmental matters, privacy,
data protection, and health and safety practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and regulations as well
as their interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations, or to
make changes necessary to comply with new or revised laws and regulations or evolving interpretations and
application of existing laws and regulations, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. For instance, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in the corporate tax policies of the United States
and other countries; trade relations among the United States and other countries, including China, Mexico and the
European Union; and changes within the European Union such as Brexit. Evolving expectations on ESG disclosures
and reporting will also result in new regulatory actions at a corporate and brand level.
Following Brexit in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1,
2021. We have experienced disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent
transportation labor shortage in the U.K. Inflationary cost pressures increased in our U.K. business in 2021, as we also
experienced in other markets. If the U.K.’s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact
the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution,
disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of
operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price could be material. (See Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Outlook – Brexit for more information.)
We may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims.
We could decide, or laws or regulations could require us, to recall products due to suspected or confirmed deliberate or
unintentional product contamination, including contamination of ingredients we use in our products that third parties
supply, spoilage or other adulteration, product mislabeling or product tampering. These risks could be heightened in
light of increased pressure on our suppliers from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain challenges. On-site quality
audits of third parties such as suppliers, external manufacturers and trademark licensees have been limited in some
instances by travel restrictions and heightened safety protocols in light of COVID-19, and remote audits do not fully
offset risks from the inability to conduct on-site audits. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative
publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of
products in this category. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation, brands, product
sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
24
Table of Contents
We may also suffer losses when our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or
regulations, or when our or our suppliers’ products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, our marketing could face
claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability claim or other legal judgment
against us, a related regulatory enforcement action, a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on
threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability.
Moreover, even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the
negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our
reputation, brands, product sales, product inventory, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock
price, and we could incur significant expense responding to such a claim.
We face risks related to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions.
We operate around the world in many regulated environments with constantly evolving legal, tax and regulatory
frameworks, and we are subject to risk of litigation, legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. Actions
by our employees, contractors or agents in violation of our policies and procedures could lead to deficiencies in our
internal or other controls or violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Furthermore, as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain challenges, there may be investigations, legal claims or litigation against us
relating to our actions or decisions in response to these conditions. We could also be subject to litigation, legal claims
or regulatory actions in connection with the continued evolution of our sustainability and ESG-related initiatives. When
litigation, legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arise out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with
applicable laws, regulations or controls, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and
adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
Even if a claim is unsuccessful, without merit or not pursued to completion, the cost of responding to such a claim,
including expenses and management time, could adversely affect us.
We could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and
procedures.
The accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations.
These limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and
fraud. If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement disclosure and
other controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our
financial statements and other disclosures, including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties, we
might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could
be unable to file financial reports or make other disclosures accurately and on a timely basis.
We face challenges as we work to meet our ESG goals and continue to evolve our ESG-related disclosures and
reporting considering various existing and developing standards, such as those of the Financial Stability Board’s TCFD,
the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the SASB Standards of the Value Reporting Foundation. We
might fail to meet our ESG goals or report on them accurately and timely.
As a result of any of these factors, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely
affected.
We face risks related to adequately protecting our valuable intellectual property rights.
We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents,
copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, recipes, technology, know-how and licensing agreements, to
be a significant and valuable part of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking
advantage of a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various countries, as well as
licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third-party misuses and
infringement of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or
any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual
property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business, financial condition and stock price.
25
Table of Contents
We may be unaware of potential third-party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology,
brands or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming
and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations. Third-party claims of
intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements.
We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products, which could include
removal of existing products from sale. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation,
brand health, ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, product sales, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
Financial Risks
We face risks related to tax matters, including changes in tax laws and rates, disagreements with taxing
authorities and imposition of new taxes.
In December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (“U.S. tax reform”) and we have factored the
original legislation as well as additional guidance issued through 2021 into our financial results of operations as
applicable. During November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that contains significant changes
to current rules but the Senate has not yet acted on it. Adoption of new U.S. tax rules could have a material adverse
effect on us.
Tax legislation enacted by foreign jurisdictions could significantly affect our ongoing operations, including rate changes
as well as additional corporate tax provisions that could disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting
payments or subject us to new types of tax. During December 2021, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and
Development (“OECD”) released model rules for a global minimum tax, which could have a material adverse effect on
us if enacted. Also see Note 16, Income Taxes, for details of the 2019 enacted Swiss tax law changes. Finally, aspects
of U.S. tax laws may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us.
Adverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to
changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision. Additionally,
changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect
deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision.
We are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if
a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest
and penalties. Unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax
provision, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.
We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
At December 31, 2021, we sold our products in over 150 countries and had operations in approximately 80 countries.
Consequently, a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial
position and operating results are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes or converted into
U.S. dollars to service obligations such as our U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our
shareholders. In addition, movements in currency exchange rates affect transaction costs because we source product
ingredients from various countries. Our efforts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily on
cross-currency transactions, may not be successful. We hedge a number of risks including exposures to foreign
exchange rate movements and volatility of interest rates that could impact our future borrowing costs. Hedging of these
risks could potentially subject us to counter-party credit risk. In addition, local economies, monetary policies and
currency hedging availability affect our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses. We might not be able
to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency risks due to factors such as continued global and local market
volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, inflation and limited hedging opportunities. Accordingly,
changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into U.S. dollars for financial reporting
purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect future demand for our
products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and our relationships with
customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term.

Table of Contents
Weak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, rising interest rates, illiquid global capital
markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets or the
effectiveness of our cash management programs, reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs.
We access the long-term and short-term global capital markets to obtain financing. Our financial performance, our
short-and long-term debt credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, the
liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy, including the food industry, could
affect our access to, and the availability and cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay
dividends in the future. Globally, central banks have indicated they are likely to change monetary policies over the next
one to two years, including increasing interest rates. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the global
capital markets on terms we find acceptable.
We regularly access the commercial paper markets in the United States and Europe for ongoing funding requirements.
A downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our
ability to issue commercial paper. Disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile
economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could
issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings.
We use cash management programs, such as factoring and supply chain finance arrangements, in our business when
circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity. If these programs or underlying customer or supplier terms do not
continue and we are unable to secure alternative programs, our cash and working capital may be negatively affected
and we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements or increase our long-term borrowings for short- and
long-term liquidity requirements.
Limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing
costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.
Volatility in the equity markets, interest rates, our participation in multiemployer pension plans and other
factors could increase our costs relating to our employees’ pensions.
We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for a number of our employees throughout the world and also contribute to
other employees’ pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor. At the end of 2021, the projected
benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was $12.6 billion and plan assets were $12.8 billion.
For defined benefit pension plans that we maintain, the difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded
status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding
requirements of those plans. Our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in
a globally diversified portfolio of investments, including equities and corporate and government debt. Among other
factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, funding requirements in the
jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market value of plan assets affect the level of plan funding, cause
volatility in the net periodic pension cost and impact our future funding requirements. Legislative and other
governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation.
Volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we will be required to make additional cash
contributions to these company-sponsored pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension
cost.
We also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain U.S. union-represented employees. As a participating
employer under multiemployer pension plans, we may owe more than the contributions we are required to make under
the applicable collective bargaining agreements. For example, if we partially or completely withdraw from a
multiemployer pension plan, we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability, such as the withdrawal
liability we are paying in connection with our complete withdrawal from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and
Industry International Pension Fund in 2018. This kind of withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a
mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, to the
consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans.
A significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the
business and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.

Overview of Business and Strategy
We make and sell primarily snacks, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy,
as well as various cheese & grocery and powdered beverage products around the world.
We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on three strategic
priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence and creating a winning growth culture.
We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our strong foundation of iconic
global and local brands, an attractive global footprint, our market leadership in developed and emerging markets, our
deep innovation, marketing and distribution capabilities, and our efficiency and sustainability efforts, will drive top- and
bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.
For more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.
Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability
COVID-19
As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues and new variants of the virus emerge, such as Omicron in late 2021, our
main priorities continue to be the safety of our employees and helping maintain the global food supply. Together with
our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners, we are working to emerge from the pandemic stronger.
During 2020, the first year of the pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in demand and revenue growth in
certain markets as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. Results were particularly
strong in modern trade (such as large grocery supermarkets and retail chains), digital commerce and especially for
categories such as biscuits. However, other parts of our business were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and
other related restrictions. This was especially so during the second quarter of 2020 for some of our emerging markets
due to store closures, particularly in our Latin America region as well as parts of our AMEA region that have a greater
concentration of traditional trade (such as small family-run stores), our world travel retail (such as international duty-free
stores), and our foodservice businesses as well as categories like gum and candy, which are more traditionally
purchased and consumed out of home. The negative impacts experienced in the second quarter of 2020 began to
subside in the second half of 2020, as demand grew in both developed and emerging markets and a number of our key
markets returned to higher growth; however, our gum and candy, world travel retail and foodservice businesses as well
as parts of our traditional trade business in parts of emerging markets continued to be negatively affected by the
ongoing pandemic.
During 2021, we continued to see increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and
developed markets relative to 2020; however, revenue from parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic
levels. In 2021, net revenue growth was 8.0% and Organic Net Revenue growth was 5.2%. In 2021, while we
experienced double-digit revenue growth in gum as well as significant growth in other areas such as foodservice and
world travel retail, revenues in these businesses were not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall outlook
for future snacks revenue growth remains strong, but as the pandemic continues, we anticipate increased volatility in
revenues until COVID-related risks and the international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints
subside and snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level.
We continue to track new developments and ongoing impacts from the pandemic. Most disruptions we experienced in
our operations due to the pandemic have been temporary and not material to our consolidated results. In the second
half of 2021, we experienced higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and fuel
costs, that we anticipate will continue into 2022. We discuss these and other ongoing impacts of COVID-19 below.

Table of Contents
Our Employees, Customers and Communities
We have taken a number of actions to promote the health and safety of our employees, customers and consumers,
which is our first priority:
•We implemented enhanced protocols to provide a safe and sanitary working environment for our employees. In
many locations, our employees are working remotely whenever possible. For employees who were unable to
work remotely, we adopted a number of heightened protocols, consistent with those prescribed by the World
Health Organization, related to social distancing (including staggering lunchtimes and shifts where possible and
restricting in-person gatherings and non-essential travel) and enhanced hygiene and workplace sanitation. We
have worked with governments and healthcare providers to help provide access to vaccines for our frontline
and office employees when and where possible at a local level. At a local level, we have also provided
additional flexibility and support to employees in our manufacturing facilities, distribution and logistics
operations and sales organization. As more employees who have been working remotely return to shared
workplaces, we have enhanced safety protocols we will follow while also encouraging continued flexible and
virtual work arrangements wherever possible.
•We have hired frontline employees in the U.S. and other locations to meet additional marketplace demand and
promote uninterrupted functioning of our manufacturing, distribution and sales network. Labor markets,
particularly in the U.S., U.K. as well as in other countries, have significantly tightened. We recognize the
demand for talent and continue to actively work to safeguard, engage, attract and retain our employees.
•Since the start of the pandemic, we have donated over $30 million to assist those impacted by COVID-19 and
to support local and global organizations responding to food instability and providing emergency relief.
Our Supply Chain and Operations
We operate in the food and beverages industry and are part of the global food supply chain. One of our main objectives
during the pandemic is to maintain the availability of our products to meet the needs of our consumers. In response to
increased demand, we increased production and until recently, we have not experienced material disruptions in our
supply chain or operations. Beginning in the second half of 2021, we began to experience more significant supply chain
disruptions and higher operating costs as noted below:
•As global supply, transportation and labor disruptions escalated in the second half of 2021, particularly in the
U.S. and U.K., we incurred higher operating costs in our business.
•We also experienced labor disruptions primarily in our North America region in the third quarter of 2021,
including a strike that affected six of our U.S. manufacturing and sales distribution facilities for several weeks.
In September 2021, after working with our employees and union representatives to resolve the strike, we
entered into a new collective bargaining agreement at these facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we did not
experience significant operating or labor disruptions. However, we anticipate some disruption in early 2022 and
higher expected absenteeism due to illness within our operations and among our third-party suppliers and
business partners primarily as a result of the Omicron variant. Throughout the second half of 2021, we also
experienced labor-related disruptions in our network of third-party logistics and external manufacturing, and we
anticipate labor shortage-related issues will continue into 2022. As a result of incremental pandemic-related
expenditures and labor disruptions, we incurred and expect to incur higher labor costs, particularly as the
pandemic continues.
•We continue to source raw ingredients, packaging, energy and transportation and deliver our products to our
customers. Costs for resources, particularly commodity and transportation costs, have continued to increase.
External factors, including the pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions, and
transportation and labor shortages, have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our operating costs.
Although we monitor these costs and our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price
increases, we cannot fully hedge against all cost increases and changes in costs, and our hedging strategies
may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials or other costs. We also may not be able to adjust
pricing timely or fully, and this may negatively affect our revenue, margins or earnings. We anticipate some of
the supply, transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends we experienced in 2021 will continue in
2022. While we have not had significant delays or unavailability of raw ingredients or other supplies, we
continue to monitor this risk. At this time, we believe we will be able to continue to source raw materials and
other supplies we use in our business.
•The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related economic effects may disrupt our global supply chain,
operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, our co-manufacturers, distributors or
other business partners. These disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product
or distribution costs and prices and continue to negatively affect operations and results.
•During the pandemic, we have incurred higher operating costs primarily for labor, customer service and
logistics, security, personal protective equipment and cleaning. While we have not had long-term, severe
supply chain disruptions, we do not know whether or how our supply chain or operations may be negatively

affected if the pandemic continues. We intend to continue to execute on our strategic operating plans as the
situation evolves. Disruptions, higher operating costs or uncertainties like those noted above could result in
delays or modifications to our plans and initiatives.
Our Liquidity
We believe the steps we have taken to enhance our capital structure and liquidity, prior to and during the pandemic,
strengthened our ability to operate during the pandemic:
•In 2021, we generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations, or approximately $3.2 billion after deducting capital
expenditures. During 2020 and 2019, we also generated $4.0 billion of cash from operations, or $3.1 billion in
2020 and $3.0 billion in 2019 after deducting capital expenditures.
•As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. As further discussed
below, in January 2022, we acquired Chipita S.A. to expand our snacks portfolio. We paid approximately €1.3
billion ($1.5 billion) in cash and we assumed and substantially paid down €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita’s
debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Based on our current
available cash and access to financing markets, we do not anticipate any issue funding our obligations,
including funding our next long-term debt maturities of approximately $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in
September 2022.
•During 2021, we generated cash of approximately $1.5 billion from the sale of KDP shares. During 2020, we
also received cash of €350 million ($394 million) from our participation in the JDE Peet’s public share offerings
and approximately $2.1 billion from our participation in the KDP secondary offering and subsequent KDP share
sales (see additional information below and in Note 7, Equity Method Investments).
•We also have access to short-term and long-term financing markets and actively utilized these markets in 2020
and 2021. We continue to utilize the commercial paper markets in the United States and Europe for flexible,
low-cost, short-term financing. We have issued additional long-term debt several times since the beginning of
2020 due to favorable market conditions and opportunities to shift a portion of our funding mix from short-term
debt to long-term debt at a low cost. We renewed one of our credit facilities in early 2021 and now have $7.0
billion of undrawn credit facilities as well as other forms of short-term and long-term financing options available.
As of December 31, 2021, we were, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants
(refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements).
Our Financial Position
•We continue to evaluate the realizability of our assets and indicators of potential impairment. We reviewed our
receivables, inventory, right-of-use lease assets, long-lived assets, equity method and other long-term
investments, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets.
•During the third quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets
and noted no impairments. Over the course of the ongoing pandemic, we have identified declines in demand
for certain of our brands, primarily in the gum category, that prompted additional evaluation of our indefinite-life
intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2021, we concluded that one biscuit brand was impaired and
we recorded a $32 million impairment charge. During 2020, we concluded that eight brands were impaired and
we recorded $144 million of impairment charges. While we did not identify impairment triggers for other brands,
there continues to be significant uncertainty due to the pandemic. If brand earnings expectations are not met or
specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or
brands could become impaired in the future. Refer to Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional
details on our intangible asset impairment evaluation.
•Restructuring and implementation activities were in line with our Simplify to Grow Program strategic objectives.
•Our equity investments in JDE Peet’s and KDP give us additional financial flexibility.
•We continue to monitor the quality of our assets and our overall financial position.
•We also continue to maintain oversight over our core process controls through our centralized shared service
model, with key controls operating as designed.
At this point in the pandemic, while we have seen some improvements in business and economic conditions across
many markets in which we do business, additional adverse impacts could arise such as those noted above and some
that we cannot currently anticipate. Barring material business disruptions or other negative developments, we expect to
meet the demand of consumers for our snacks, food and beverage products. Our overall outlook for future snacks
revenue growth remains strong, but as the pandemic continues, we anticipate increased volatility in revenues until
COVID-related risks and current international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints subside and
snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level. Also, different markets and
33
Table of Contents
parts of our business may recover from the COVID-19 pandemic at different rates depending on many factors including
vaccination levels or new COVID-19 variants and related outbreaks. As we continue to proactively manage our
business in response to the evolving impacts of the pandemic, we continue to prioritize and support our employees and
customers; monitor and work to further safeguard our supply chain, operations, technology and assets; protect our
liquidity and financial position; work toward our strategic priorities and monitor our financial performance. We seek to
position the Company to withstand the current uncertainties related to this pandemic and to emerge stronger.
Chipita Acquisition
On January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A., which is a strategic complement to our existing
snacks portfolio and advances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. The cash consideration
for Chipita totaled €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and also substantially paid down €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion)
of Chipita’s debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Refer to Note 2,
Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details.
KDP and JDE Peet’s Equity Method Investment Transactions
KDP
On June 7, 2021, we sold approximately 28 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership interest to 6.4%. We
received $997 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $520 million (or $392 million after-tax) during the
second quarter of 2021. On August 2, 2021, we sold approximately 14.7 million KDP shares, which reduced our
ownership interest to 5.3%. We received $500 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $248 million (or $189
million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2021. The cash taxes associated with the KDP share sales were paid in
2021.
On March 4, 2020, we participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 6.8 million shares,
which reduced our ownership interest by 0.5% to 13.1%. We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax
gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020. Subsequently, on August 3, 2020, we sold
approximately 14.1 million shares and on September 9, 2020, we sold approximately 12.5 million shares, which in the
aggregate reduced our KDP ownership interest to 11.2%. During the third quarter of 2020, we received $777 million of
proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $335 million (or $258 million after tax). On November 17, 2020, we sold
approximately 40.0 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 2.8% to 8.4%. We received $1,132 million
of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $459 million (or $350 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2020. The
cash taxes associated with the KDP share sales were paid in 2020.
During 2019, we recognized a $23 million pre-tax gain related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our
ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%.
JDE Peet’s
During the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the JDE Peet’s offering of its ordinary shares, we exchanged our
26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet’s. On May 29, 2020, we participated in the
JDE Peet’s offering and, with the subsequent exercise of the over-allotment option, we sold a total of approximately
11.1 million shares during the second quarter of 2020. We received €350 million ($394 million) of total proceeds from
the sales of JDE Peet’s shares and we recorded a preliminary pre-tax gain of $121 million during the second quarter of
2020. We also incurred a $261 million tax expense. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain
by $10 million to $131 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we reduced our tax expense by $11 million to $250
million and we paid the associated cash tax by the end of 2021.
For additional information, refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments, Note 16, Income Taxes, and Note 9, Debt and
Borrowing Arrangements.
Tax Reform
We continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform. In 2019, the most significant tax reform impact was
from Swiss tax reform. On August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal
Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019
Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The
intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of
34
Table of Contents
internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “Swiss tax reform”. Based on these Federal /
Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September
30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which
consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax
purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling,
general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective
January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information.
Summary of Results
 
•Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021
and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for
most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though
some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for
in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as
they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic.
In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with
strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In
addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the
pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail
businesses.
–Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant
impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the
U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our
acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give & Go in 2020.
–Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental
net revenues from our acquisitions of Give & Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items
were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar
strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior
year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and
Africa.
•Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020.
Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing,
despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant
currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it
provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of
Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing
later in this section).
•Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to
$2.47 in 2020.
–Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year
costs associated with the JDE Peet’s transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts
from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-
year loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower
Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent
consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method
investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from
divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from
pension participation changes.
–Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts
from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt
extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible
asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and
commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from
pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method
investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a
benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower
losses related to interest rate swaps.
35
Table of Contents
•Adjusted EPS increased 12.1% to $2.87 in 2021 and increased 6.7% to $2.56 in 2020. On a constant currency
basis, Adjusted EPS increased 9.0% to $2.79 in 2021 and increased 8.3% to $2.60 in 2020.
–For 2021, operating gains, favorable currency translation, fewer shares outstanding, higher equity
method investment earnings and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher taxes primarily due
to a lower net benefit from non-recurring discrete tax items, drove the Adjusted EPS growth.
–For 2020, operating gains, an increase in benefit plan non-service income and fewer shares
outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, primarily drove the Adjusted EPS
growth.
Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use
these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the
definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within Non-GAAP Financial Measures
appearing later in this section).
Financial Outlook
We seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating
metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial
metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan
and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to
investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we
use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results
and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to
our GAAP results. We have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in Non-
GAAP Financial Measures, which appears later in this section.
In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact
our revenue and profitability objectives.
COVID-19 – As described above, we continue to monitor and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. While its impact is
not yet fully known, it has had a material negative effect on the global and local economies and could have a material
negative effect on our business and results in the future, particularly if there are significant adverse changes to
consumer demand or significant disruptions to the supply, production or distribution of our products or the credit or
financial stability of our customers and other business partners. While we have seen some improvements in overall
economic conditions and the business climate in many markets where we sell and operate, COVID-19 variants such as
Omicron and spikes in infections continue across a number of markets. If a significant economic or credit deterioration
occurs, it could impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A significant disruption in the
financial markets may also have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking or
other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative
contracts. As we continue to manage operations during the pandemic, we will continue to prioritize the safety of our
employees and consumers and we may continue to incur increased labor, customer service, commodity, transportation
and other costs. We could see shifts in consumer demand and product mix that could have a negative impact on
results. As discussed in Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability, we are working to mitigate
negative impacts to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, but we may not be able to fully predict or respond to all
impacts on a timely basis to prevent adverse impacts to our results. Any of these and other developments could
materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Chipita acquisition – As described above, on January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A. The cash
consideration for Chipita totaled €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and substantially paid down €0.4 billion
($0.4 billion) of Chipita’s debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Refer to
Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details.
Demand – We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we
sell our products. Core snacks categories continued to expand in 2021 due to the continued growth of snacking as a
consumer behavior around the world. As part of our strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our
local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building
strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability
36
Table of Contents
across multiple channels. We believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our
positions across markets.
Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends – Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth,
urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in
emerging markets. Our recent research underscores the growth of snacking worldwide and how behavior, sentiment
and routines surrounding food are being reshaped by COVID-19. Snacking, which was already increasing among
consumers, continues to grow according to snack category findings noted above and supported by the findings from
the third annual State of Snacking report, commissioned by Mondelēz International and issued in January 2022. The
report was conducted in conjunction with consumer poll specialist The Harris Poll and summarizes the findings from
interviews with thousands of consumers across 12 countries. We believe that snacks continue to be a source of
comfort as well as excitement and variety for consumers. Social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends,
inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. Consumers are also interested in buying snacks
conveniently, whether through same-day delivery apps, shipped sources or different retail settings. Many consumers
also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, valuing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon
footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. We seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and
preferences and align with our strategic priorities.
Volatility of Global Markets – Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, including in
emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater
vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our
products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. As further discussed in COVID-19 above and
in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, we continue to monitor volatility in global
consumer, commodity, transportation, labor, currency and capital markets that may continue until the COVID-19
pandemic or related issues are largely resolved. We expect input cost volatility and a higher aggregate cost
environment to continue into 2022 as we manage through the pandemic and new COVID-19 variants, the related
recovery, labor shortages, inflation, supply chain disruptions (including any potential disruptions in the availability of raw
materials, packaging, transportation, energy or other supplies) and adverse weather factors. (See also below for a
discussion of Brexit and Argentina, which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018.) In addition, the
imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and
potential changes in U.S. trade programs, trade relations, regulations, taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our
sales or profitability. To help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets, we aim to protect profitability
through the management of costs (including hedging) and pricing as well as targeted investments in our brands and
new routes to market.
Competition – We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our
advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building
our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market
positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a local-first commercial focus, new digital
and other sales and marketing initiatives, product innovation and high standards of product quality. We also continue to
optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development,
advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.
Pricing – Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such
as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends we
experienced, particularly in the second half of 2021. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables
including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we have increased prices
to control costs given recent significant cost inflation. However, we may not be able to adjust pricing fully or timely in
response to rising costs, and this may negatively affect our revenue, margins or earnings.
Operating Costs – Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses,
taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives,
sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. To remain competitive on our operating
structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our Simplify to Grow Program, which is
designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead
costs. During the second half of 2021, in particular, we experienced higher operating costs, including higher overall raw
material, transportation, labor and fuel costs that we anticipate will continue into 2022.
37
Table of Contents
Taxes – We continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. During November 2021, the
U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that contains significant changes to currently enacted U.S. tax rules but
the Senate has not yet acted on it. In December 2021, the OECD released model rules for a global minimum tax. Both
of these proposed legislative changes could have a material effect on us if enacted.
Currency – As a global company with 75.1% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are
continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. While we hedge significant
forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our non-
U.S. operations, we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange
rates on our consolidated financial results. To partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas
operations, we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency-denominated debt, cross-
currency swaps and other financial instruments. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks, factors such
as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging
opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our
results of operations or financial position. See additional discussion of Brexit and Argentina below and refer also to
Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, and
Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks. As currency
movements can make comparison of year-over-year operating performance challenging, we isolate the impact of
currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis, holding prior-year currency exchange rates constant, so
that prior-year and current-year results can be compared on a consistent basis.
Brexit – Following Brexit in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on
January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K.
and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both
the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations,
documentation and reviews. Our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well
as finished goods. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in
our factories and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased
number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw
materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes
to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution,
including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and
distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, inflationary cost pressures increased in our U.K. business in
2021, as we also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.’s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U.
negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or
distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our
consolidated net revenues in the U.K.
U.K. advertising and promotion ban – In the United Kingdom, a ban on specific types of TV and online advertising of
food containing levels of fat, sugar or salt above specified thresholds is expected to go into effect in 2023, and new
measures restricting certain promotions and in-store placement of some of those products are expected to go into
effect in October 2022. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the impact of the restrictions, they could
significantly negatively affect our U.K. results of operations in 2022 and thereafter.
Argentina – as further discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and
Highly Inflationary Accounting, on July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean
subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million
in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to
the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods. The mix of monetary
assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert Argentinean pesos to U.S. dollars could change over time, so it
is difficult to predict the overall impact of the Argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings.
Gum Portfolio Review – During 2021, we began and continue to conduct a strategic review of our developed market
gum business. We expect to complete the review and have more information in mid 2022.
38
Table of Contents
Financing Costs – We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use low-cost, short- and long-
term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share
repurchases. We continued to secure low-cost short and long-term debt during 2021. In September 2021, we issued
our first green bonds, raising nearly €2.0 billion and enabling us to cost-effectively fund eligible projects that align with
our sustainability priorities in the areas of building a thriving ingredient supply chain and reducing our environmental
impact. In September 2021, through our subsidiary Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), we
also issued €300 million of zero interest exchangeable notes that are redeemable for cash or existing ordinary shares
of JDE Peet's at our option. We also continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our
exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and
protect the value of our debt. We also enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps, forwards and option collars to
hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. Our net investment hedge
derivative contracts have had and are expected to have a favorable impact and reduce some of the financing costs and
related currency impacts within our interest costs. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, and Note 10,
Financial Instruments, for additional information on our debt and derivative activity.
Cybersecurity Risks – Global cybersecurity risks continue to increase, including during the pandemic and as more
employees are working remotely and virtually outside of traditional workplaces. In response, we continue to be on
heightened alert and dedicate focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery and to provide
ongoing workforce training and employ security measures to protect our systems and data. We are also focusing on
enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment, including but not limited to the manufacturing
environment and operational technologies, as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats.
While we have taken security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute
certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely
basis.

(1)Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.
Net revenue increase of 8.0% was driven by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 5.2%, favorable currency,
the impact of acquisitions and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had
been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. Overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category
products, though parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food
purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets
as they lapped strong volume growth in 2020 resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In
emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong
revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, sales
of our gum and candy products grew as out-of-home consumption continued to recover, as did our world travel
business as global travel improved, though still below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency translation and
incremental net revenues from acquisitions also added to revenue growth in 2021.
Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix in
Europe, AMEA and Latin America was primarily driven by strong volume gains as we lapped the significant negative
impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets. This was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North
America as the region lapped very strong prior-year volume growth from significant food purchases for in-home
consumption due to the pandemic. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from
2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021. Favorable currency impacts(1)

increased net revenues by $462 million, due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar,
including the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, South African rand and
Mexican peso, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean
peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of
$47 million (constant currency basis), the March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of
$63 million (constant currency basis), the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38
million and the April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million in 2021. The
packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on
November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions

During 2021, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was largely offset by increased input
costs. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of
input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by
Europe, AMEA and Latin America, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America. Overall,
volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our
key markets, while in North America, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for in-
home consumption due to the pandemic. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially
offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related
costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as
well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted
in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from
acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher
acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow
Program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition
integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative
expenses increased $133 million from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer
promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19
related costs.
Favorable currency changes increased operating income by $118 million due primarily to the strength of several
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan. Australian dollar and
Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the
Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.
Operating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. The increase in operating income margin
was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and
commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, a net
benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs
associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher
divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin for 2021 was flat to
2020 at 16.6%. Adjusted Operating Income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs
due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative
costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer
promotion costs.

Net revenue increase of 2.8% was driven by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 3.7% and the impact of
acquisitions, mostly offset by unfavorable currency and the impact of a prior-year divestiture. Net revenues were higher
in developed markets, particularly North America, where due to the COVID-19 outbreak and response, demand for our
products, primarily biscuits and chocolate, grew significantly as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home
consumption. However, our gum and candy categories as well as our world travel retail and foodservice businesses
were negatively impacted by COVID-19. In emerging markets, where we have a greater concentration of traditional
trade, several markets were challenged by COVID-19 impacts, particularly those with significant gum and candy
portfolios. Overall, as the negative impacts of COVID-19 experienced in the first half of the year subsided in the second
half of the year, revenue growth began to recover in a number of our key emerging markets, though overall emerging
markets net revenues declined due to unfavorable currency impacts.
Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all
regions except Europe was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2019 as well as the effects of input cost-driven
pricing actions taken during 2020. Favorable volume/mix in North America and Europe, partially offset by unfavorable
volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA, included strong volume gains tempered by unfavorable mix reflecting shifts in
consumer purchases in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give & Go added
incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks
added incremental net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $637
million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real,
Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, South African rand and Turkish lira, partially offset by
the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Philippine peso, British pound sterling,
Egyptian pound and Swedish krona. The impact of the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the
Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions
and Divestitures, for more information.(1)

During 2020, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was largely offset by increased input
costs. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2019 as well as the effects of
input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2020, was reflected in all regions except Europe. Favorable volume/mix
was driven by North America and Europe, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and
AMEA. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing
costs driven by productivity net of incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to
higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as higher cocoa, dairy, sugar, energy,
packaging, nuts, grains and other ingredients costs, partially offset by lower costs for oils.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $38 million from 2019, due to a number of factors noted
in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact related to expenses, favorable change from the
resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower implementation costs incurred
for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year value-added tax (“VAT”) related settlements, lapping prior-year
CEO transition remuneration and lapping the prior-year divestiture. These decreases were partially offset by the impact
of acquisitions, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension
participation changes, unfavorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in Argentina (remeasurement
loss in 2020 as compared to a remeasurement gain in 2019) and higher acquisition-related costs. Excluding these
factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $77 million from 2019. The increase was driven
primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending net of
incremental COVID-19 related costs.
We recorded an expense of $11 million from a VAT-related settlement in Latin America in 2019. Unfavorable currency
changes decreased operating income by $59 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most
currencies, including the Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Indian rupee, Swiss franc, South African rand and Turkish lira,
partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Egyptian pound,
Philippine peso, British pound sterling and Swedish krona.
Operating income margin decreased from 14.9% in 2019 to 14.5% in 2020. The decrease in operating income margin
was driven primarily by the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and
commodity hedging activities, higher intangible asset impairment charges, costs associated with the JDE Peet's
transaction, lapping the prior-year gain on a divestiture and lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation
changes, partially offset by the favorable impact from the resolution of tax matters and lower costs for the Simplify to
Grow Program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.5% in 2019 to 16.6% in 2020. The increase in
Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by higher pricing, lower manufacturing costs reflecting
productivity net of incremental COVD-19 costs, and selling, general and administrative cost leverage, mostly offset by
higher raw material costs.

Results of Operations by Operating Segment
Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:
•Latin America
•AMEA
•Europe
•North America
We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business
environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional
management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.
We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is
appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 18,
Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments and Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results

2021 compared with 2020:
Net revenues increased $320 million (12.9%), due to higher net pricing (13.6 pp) and favorable volume/mix (6.8 pp),
partially offset by unfavorable currency (7.5 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily
by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Favorable volume/mix reflected strong volume growth as the negative impacts from
the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across the region. Favorable volume/mix was driven by
gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and cheese &
grocery. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies
in the region including the Argentinean peso and Brazilian real.
Segment operating income increased $72 million (38.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower manufacturing
costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable volume/mix and lower costs incurred for
the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher
advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, divestiture-related costs incurred in 2021, higher
other selling, general and administrative expenses and lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters.
2020 compared with 2019:
Net revenues decreased $541 million (17.9%), due to unfavorable currency (18.1 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (7.5
pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (7.7 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of
the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso and Mexican
peso. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to the negative volume impact from the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the
impact of pricing-related elasticity. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum and candy, partially offset by
gains in cheese & grocery, chocolate, refreshment beverages and biscuits. Higher net pricing was reflected across all
categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.
Segment operating income decreased $152 million (44.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, unfavorable
volume/mix, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of lapping the
expense of VAT-related settlements in 2019) and an unfavorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in
Argentina (remeasurement loss in 2020 as compared to a remeasurement gain in 2019). These unfavorable items were
partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower
costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and higher benefits from the resolution of a tax matter.

2021 compared with 2020:
Net revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher
net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on
November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net
overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across
most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate,
biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable
currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan,
Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories
except cheese & grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million
(constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of
Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.
Segment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity
and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the
Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset
impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021
acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer
promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.
2020 compared with 2019:
Net revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp)
and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were
due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South
African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the
U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019
divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net
revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was
tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets.
Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset
by gains in biscuits and cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages
and cheese & grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.
Segment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year
expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental
COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment
charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by
higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.

2021 compared with 2020:
Net revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher
net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most
currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish
krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the
Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced
increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as
global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in
chocolate, biscuits, cheese & grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher
net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade
added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.
Segment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing,
lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related
costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and
administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw
material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and
acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.
2020 compared with 2019:
Net revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing
(0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the
net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially
offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other
restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese & grocery, biscuits and refreshment
beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate,
partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese & grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency
impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble,
Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region
relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.
Segment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred
for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were
partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other
selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.

2021 compared with 2020:
Net revenues increased $145 million (1.8%), due to the impact of acquisitions (1.8 pp), higher net pricing (1.0 pp) and
favorable currency (0.6 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (1.6 pp). The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &
Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net
revenues of $38 million in 2021. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net
pricing in chocolate. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S.
dollar. Unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven
by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor
disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in
biscuits, candy, chocolate and gum.
Segment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw
material costs, higher Simplify to Grow Program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These
unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses
(including lower COVID-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration
adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental COVID-19
related costs and productivity) and favorable currency.
2020 compared with 2019:
Net revenues increased $1,049 million (14.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (6.3 pp), the impact of acquisitions (6.3
pp) and higher net pricing (2.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix, in part due
to the positive volume impact from COVID-19 as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption,
was driven by gains in biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, chocolate and candy. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of
Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in
Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, chocolate and
candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S.
dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.
Segment operating income increased $136 million (9.4%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing and
the impact of acquisitions. These favorable items were partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion
costs, intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including
incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher raw material costs, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension
participation changes and higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program.

Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial
statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods
presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies
we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our
critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant
assumptions and estimates.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:
We test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill
impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general
economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure
for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative
testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and
other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a
reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted
cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual
value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of
capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting
units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to
make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available
information. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of COVID-19, those estimates
could be significantly different than future performance. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its
fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting
unit's fair value.
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2021 annual impairment testing,
each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our
annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors
outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or
reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.
Annually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing
events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. If significant potential
impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value
with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and
estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and
its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.
During 2021, we recorded $32 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a biscuit brand in North
America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of
the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We use several
accepted valuation methods, including relief of royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of
future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. We also
identified eight brands with $1,146 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2021 that each had a fair value
in excess of book value of 10% or less. We continue to monitor our brand performance, particularly in light of the
significant uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our business. If the brand earnings
expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change
significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2020, we recorded $144 million of
intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $83 million in North
America, $53 million in Europe, $5 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. In 2019, we recorded $57 million of
intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $39 million in Europe,
$15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America.

Trade and Marketing Programs:
We promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These
programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based
incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales
incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at
the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim
reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of
volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end
consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.
Employee Benefit Plans:
We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and
postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare
benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected
compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost
trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on
current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s
best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations
recognized for the underlying plans.
As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The
cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service
cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the
employees expected to receive benefits.
Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects
our plan obligations and expenses. For plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets
assumption affects our pension plan expenses. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and
our process for setting these assumptions are described in Note 11, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial
statements.
While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2021 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and
postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the
expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan
costs:

See additional information on our employee benefit plans in Note 11, Benefit Plans.
Income Taxes:
As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The
provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes
and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the
geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning
opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.

Table of Contents
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income
in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established
for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax
positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than
not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The
amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in
light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations.
We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable.
However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or
administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected
on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term
financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and
future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases
and quarterly dividends. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as
needed. We continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements.
We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Our investments in
JDE Peet's and KDP also provide us additional flexibility. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding
sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and to date, we have been successful in raising financing as
needed, including during the pandemic, and generally on favorable terms. However, in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic or otherwise, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues, it could have a material adverse effect on
our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
Our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including
expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing,
tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions,
shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases) and property, plant and equipment.
Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to Note 9, Debt and
Borrowing Arrangements), our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to Note 16, Income
Taxes), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to Note 11, Benefit Plans) and commodity-related purchase
commitments and derivative contracts (refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments).
We generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds
from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to Debt below). We generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing
obligations.
Cash Flow:
We believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and
secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term
financial commitments. Our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below:
2021 2020 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,141 $ 3,964 $ 3,965 
Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities $ (26)$ 500 $ (960)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (4,069)$ (2,215)$ (2,787)
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was due primarily to higher earnings and lower
working capital requirements, partially offset by higher tax payments and lower dividends received from our equity
method investments. Net cash provided by operating activities was largely flat in 2020 relative to 2019 as higher cash
tax payments in 2020 (primarily related to sales of KDP and JDE Peet's shares and the resolution of several indirect tax
matters under a tax amnesty program in India) and the payment of costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction in
2020 were largely offset by working capital improvements.
Net Cash Used in/Provided by Investing Activities:
Net cash from investing activities was lower in 2021 due primarily to lower cash proceeds from partial sales of our
equity method investment shares (refer to Note 7, Equity Method Investments) and higher capital expenditures, partially
offset by less cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 for Hu, Grenade and Gourmet Food than in 2020 for Give & Go (refer
to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures). The increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 relative to
2019 was primarily due to cash received from the sale of shares in the JDE Peet's and KDP offerings and lower capital
expenditures, partially offset by cash paid to acquire a majority interest in Give & Go.
Capital expenditures were $965 million in 2021, $863 million in 2020 and $925 million in 2019. We continue to make
capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives.
We expect 2022 capital expenditures to be up to $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures in connection
60
Table of Contents
with our Simplify to Grow Program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these
expenditures with cash from operations.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:
The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher amounts of net long-term debt repayments,
higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2021 than in 2020. The decrease in net cash used in financing
activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases, partially
offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020.
Chipita Acquisition
On January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled €1.3 billion
($1.5 billion) and we assumed and substantially paid down €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita's debt in January for a
total purchase price of approximately €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Cash paid for the business was raised from cash from
operations and by issuing long-term debt in the third quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures,
and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional details.
Supply Chain Financing
As part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the
past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current
payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable.
We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing (“SCF”) programs through several participating financial institutions.
Under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating
financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in SCF programs has no bearing on our payment
terms or amounts due. Our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms.
No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF programs and we have no
economic interest in the suppliers’ decision to participate in the SCF programs. Amounts due to our suppliers that
elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet. We have
been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, $2.5
billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are
outstanding.
Guarantees:
As discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the
long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual
payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2021, we had no material third-party guarantees
recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material
effect on our liquidity.
Debt:
The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of
current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and
second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The
second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other
forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.
Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for a projection of long-term debt scheduled to mature (including
current maturities and finance leases) in future periods. In the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $1.7
billion of maturing long-term debt including: $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in September 2022. We fund
ongoing debt maturities and other long-term obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with long-
term debt or short-term financing (such as our commercial paper borrowings) depending on financing available, timing
considerations, flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing.
During December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new $7.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the
prior $6.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2021, all $7.0 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained
available.
Our total debt was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Our debt-to-
capitalization ratio was 0.41 at December 31, 2021 and 0.42 at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average term of
61
Table of Contents
our outstanding long-term debt was 9.5 years at December 31, 2021 and 7.4 years at December 31, 2020. Our
average daily commercial borrowings were $0.5 billion in 2021, $2.3 billion in 2020 and $4.1 billion in 2019. We had
commercial paper borrowings of $0.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and no commercial paper borrowings outstanding
as of December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to use cash or commercial paper to finance various short-term
financing needs. As of December 31, 2021, we continued to be in compliance with our debt covenants.
One of our subsidiaries, MIHN, has outstanding debt. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements. The
operations held by MIHN generated approximately 73.5% (or $21.1 billion) of the $28.7 billion of consolidated net
revenue during fiscal year 2021 and represented approximately 79.2% (or $22.4 billion) of the $28.3 billion of net
assets as of December 31, 2021.
Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.
Commodity Trends
We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure
ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2021, the primary drivers of the increase in our
aggregate commodity costs were higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased
costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.
A number of external factors such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, climate and weather conditions, commodity,
transportation and labor market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other
programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address
higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and
overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw
materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a
limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.
Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange
rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.
As a result of international supply chain, transportation and labor market disruptions and generally higher
commodity, transportation and labor costs in the second half of 2021, we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate
cost environment to continue in 2022. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will
continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available.
Equity and Dividends
Stock Plans:
See Note 12, Stock Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant
activity during 2019-2021.
Share Repurchases:
See Note 13, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements and Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,
for more information on our share repurchase program.
As of December 31, 2021, our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases up to $23.7 billion through
December 31, 2023. Under this program, we have repurchased approximately $20.0 billion of shares through
December 31, 2021 ($2.1 billion in 2021, $1.4 billion in 2020, $1.5 billion in 2019, $2.0 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in
2017, $2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013), at a weighted-average cost
of $41.95 per share.
The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on
numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of
cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions
and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may
fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.

Dividends:
We paid dividends of $1,826 million in 2021, $1,678 million in 2020 and $1,542 million in 2019. On July 27, 2021, the
Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.35 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 11 percent, which would be $1.40 per common share on an
annualized basis. In 2020, our quarterly cash dividend increased from $0.285 to $0.315 per share of Class A Common
Stock, an increase of 11 percent, and in 2019, our quarterly cash dividend increased from $0.26 to $0.285 per share of
Class A Common Stock, an increase of 10 percent. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our
Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements,
future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders
in 2021 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. Shareholders should consult their
tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to
facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide
additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to
budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP
adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following
categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments,
major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and
hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP
measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the
reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP
results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this
Form 10-K.
Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year
operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change,
we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis .
•“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and
currency rate fluctuations . We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and
developed markets.
•Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding
Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine,
Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the
Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.
•Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries
included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.
•“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow
Program; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets;
divestiture or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs, acquisition-related costs, and
acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments; the operating results of divestitures
; remeasurement of net monetary position; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency
and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts; impact from resolution of tax matters; CEO
transition remuneration; impact from pension participation changes; initial impacts from enacted tax law
changes ; and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. We also present “Adjusted Operating
Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate
growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis.
•“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations
excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt
extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as
accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, net earnings from divestitures;
and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity
method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ significant operating and
non-operating items . We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis .
(1)    When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-
GAAP definitions. In the second quarter of 2021, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of initial impacts from enacted
tax law changes (refer to footnote (10) below). In the third quarter of 2021, we also added the exclusion of contingent consideration
adjustments (refer to footnote (2) below) and the mark-to-market impacts from equity method investment transaction derivatives
contracts (refer to footnote (6) below).
(2)    Divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of
major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As we record our share of KDP and JDE Peet’s ongoing
earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP
results the following quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made to our
acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition. We made this adjustment to better
facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 7,
Equity Method Investments, for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.(1)

(3)    Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency
operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to
determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from
the comparable prior-year period.
(4)    Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to
transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in
the non-GAAP adjustments.
(5)    During the third quarter of 2018, as we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for Argentina (refer to Note 1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies), we excluded the remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or
liabilities in Argentina during the period to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains/losses for Venezuela
when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to deconsolidation in 2015.
(6)    We exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity
method investment transaction derivative from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and
forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since
we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements
in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to
facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction
derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.
(7)    See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies – Tax Matters, for additional information.
(8)    On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International in advance of her retirement
at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we provided him compensation with a total combined target
value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former
employer. The compensation we granted took the form of cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In
connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and
2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from
January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements
together as “CEO transition remuneration.” We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our non-
GAAP results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would
have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van
de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018, we excluded amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld’s service as Chairman and
partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s equity grants. In 2019, we excluded amounts related to the partial vesting of
Mr. Van de Put’s equity grants. During the first quarter of 2020, Mr. Van de Put's equity grants became fully vested.
(9)    The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from
multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our
non–GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, Benefit Plans, for more
information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.
(10)    We have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of
deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Previously, we only excluded the initial impacts from more
material tax reforms, specifically the impacts of the 2019 Swiss tax reform and 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from
enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes.
Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information on the impact of Swiss and U.S. tax reform.
(11)    We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ significant operating and non-operating items such as
acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to
provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board
representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results
and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or
resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that
we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of
the investees’ significant operating and non-operating items.
We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S.
GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you
with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent
these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures
presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these
non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial
measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact
on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP
financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables
that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.

Organic Net Revenue:
Applying the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S.
GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that Organic
Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved
comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed
markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

Adjusted Operating Income:
Applying the definition of “Adjusted Operating Income”, the adjustments made to “operating income” (the most
comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program; intangible
asset impairment charges; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment
transaction derivative contracts; acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments; acquisition
related costs; divestiture-related costs; operating income from divestitures; net gain on an acquisition and divestitures;
costs associated with JDE Peet's transaction; the remeasurement of net monetary position; impact from pension
participation changes; impact from resolution of tax matters; CEO transition remuneration; and initial impacts from
enacted tax law changes. We also evaluate Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. We believe these
measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.

Adjusted EPS:
Applying the definition of “Adjusted EPS” , the adjustments made to “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz
International” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impacts of the items listed in
the Adjusted Operating Income tables above as well as net earnings from divestitures; losses related to interest rate
swaps; losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; initial impacts from enacted tax laws changes; gains or
losses on equity method investment transactions; and our proportionate share of significant operating and non-
operating items recorded by our JDE Peet's and KDP equity method investees. We also evaluate Adjusted EPS on a
constant currency basis. We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved comparability of underlying operating results.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market
risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management
program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the
volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.
During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and related global response significantly impacted economic activity and
markets around the world. National and local governments imposed preventative or protective restrictions on travel and
business operations and advised or required citizens to remain at home. Temporary closures of businesses were
ordered and numerous other businesses temporarily closed voluntarily. The impact of the global pandemic and
response has had a material unfavorable impact on global markets, including commodity, currency and capital markets.
While some of these markets such as the U.S. and other major stock markets and certain currencies have rebounded
significantly in the second and third quarters of 2020, these markets are likely to continue to remain volatile while the
situation continues. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital
when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and
could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a
number of our derivative contracts. We are actively working to mitigate these risks and we largely employed existing
strategies that are described below to mitigate these market risks related to currency, commodity and interest rate risks.
We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise
from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our
derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price
and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments.
Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency
exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash
flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar
denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated
reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A
stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets
while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted
currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we
cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial
results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion
and Analysis of Historical Results for currency exchange effects on our financial results. Throughout our discussion and
analysis of results, we isolate currency impacts and supplementally provide net revenues, operating income and diluted
earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent
currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see
Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting.
We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely
due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions such as
the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability
and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, transportation, labor and other disruptions that are
increasing operating costs and impacting our results. To manage input cost volatility and inflation, we enter into forward
purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving
measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.
We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in
which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads,
commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). The last publication
date of LIBOR rates against various currencies by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom was
December 31, 2021, with the publication of certain USD rates being phased out after June 30, 2023. We did not have a
significant impact to our financial position from the phase out of LIBOR, nor do we expect a significant impact from the
remaining phase out given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt. We periodically use interest rate swaps and
forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable
71
Table of Contents
versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. For more information on our 2020 debt
activity, see Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements.
See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on our derivative activity.
Value at Risk:
We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest
rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and
commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency
exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The
instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange
risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded
from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in
non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.
The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A
parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest
rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and
commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by
observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of
VAR amounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average
VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis
with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest
rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our
currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were: 
 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact
 At 12/31/21 Average High Low At 12/31/21 Average High Low
 (in millions)
Instruments sensitive to:
Interest rates $ 135 $ 104 $135 $ 79 
Foreign currency rates$ 11 $ 11 $ 13 $ 9 
Commodity prices 52 41 61 24 
 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact
 At 12/31/20 Average High Low At 12/31/20 Average High Low
 (in millions)
Instruments sensitive to:
Interest rates $ 91 $ 142 $308 $ 76 
Foreign currency rates$ 16 $ 20 $ 31 $ 16 
Commodity prices 6 25 42 6 
This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under
the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates,
currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or
earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual
future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market
rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial
results.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mondelēz International, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,
including the related notes and financial statement schedule for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2021 listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
73
Table of Contents
As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded
Hu Master Holdings (“Hu”), Lion/Gemstone Topco Ltd (“Grenade”), and Gourmet Food Holdings Pty Ltd (“Gourmet
Food”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because they were
acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded Hu, Grenade, and
Gourmet Food from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Hu and Gourmet Food are wholly-owned
subsidiaries, and Grenade is a majority-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from
management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent 0.2% and
0.5%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,
2021.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical
audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.
Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets Annual Impairment Assessments for Certain Brand Names
As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-life
intangible asset balance was $17.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, which consists principally of brand names. At least
annually management assesses indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment and if significant potential impairment
risk exists for a specific asset, management quantitatively tests the asset for impairment by comparing its estimated fair
value with its carrying value. As disclosed by management, management estimates fair value using several accepted
valuation methods, including relief of royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales,
earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates to determine a brand name’s fair value.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-life intangible
asset annual impairment assessments for certain brand names is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment
by management when developing the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible assets; (ii) a high degree of auditor
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions
related to estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for certain brand names;
and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
74
Table of Contents
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the indefinite-life intangible asset impairment assessments, including controls over the annual
valuation of certain brand names. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for
developing the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible assets; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation
methods; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the methods; and (iv) evaluating the
reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the estimates of future sales, earnings
growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to estimates
of future sales and earnings growth rates involved evaluating whether the significant assumptions used by
management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the certain brand names; (ii) the
consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence
obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in
evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation methods and (ii) the reasonableness of the royalty rate
and discount rate significant assumptions.

Mondelēz International, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business:
Mondelēz International, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mondelēz International, Inc.,
through its subsidiaries (collectively “Mondelēz International,” “we,” “us” and “our”), sells food and beverage products to
consumers in over 150 countries.
Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include Mondelēz International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority
owned subsidiaries, except our Venezuelan subsidiaries which were deconsolidated in 2015. All intercompany
transactions are eliminated. The noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the results
of subsidiaries that we control and consolidate. We account for investments over which we exercise significant
influence under the equity method of accounting. Investments over which we do not have significant influence or control
are not material and as there is no readily determinable fair value for the equity interests, these investments are carried
at cost with changes in the investment recognized to the extent cash is received.
Use of Estimates:
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of
amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions
include, among others, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets,
restructuring program liabilities, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserves, pension and
benefit plan assumptions and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, expectations of future
impacts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Given the uncertainty of the global economic
environment and the impact of COVID-19, our estimates could be significantly different than future performance. If
actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the updates in our consolidated results of operations in the period the
actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual
amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:
•Latin America
•AMEA
•Europe
•North America
See Note 18, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments.
Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting:
We translate the results of operations of our subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during
each period and translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency
translation adjustments as a component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange
gains and losses on transactions in earnings.
Highly inflationary accounting is triggered when a country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. It
requires the remeasurement of financial statements of subsidiaries in the country, from the functional currency of the
subsidiary to our U.S. dollar reporting currency, with currency remeasurement gains or losses recorded in earnings. As
discussed below, beginning on July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our operations in
Argentina.
81
Table of Contents
Argentina. During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates that indicated Argentina's three-
year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for
accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean
subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both
monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinean pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars
using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses
recorded in net earnings. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentinean operations had $9 million of Argentinean peso
denominated net monetary assets. Our Argentinean operations contributed $401 million, or 1.4% of consolidated net
revenues in 2021. We recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in
2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the
revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods.
Brexit. Following the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union (“Brexit”) in 2020, a new trade
arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions
include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms,
including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade
between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To comply with the
new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories, and on our customs
support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions.
We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished
goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing
requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to
the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite
our efforts to control costs, we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business this year, as we have
also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.’s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively
impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution,
disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our net revenues in the
U.K.
Other Countries. Since we sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries,
we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures.
We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our `business operations, currencies
and net monetary exposures. Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, most countries in which we do
business experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate volatility. At this time, except
for Argentina which is accounted for as a highly inflationary economy, we do not anticipate any other countries in which
we operate to be at risk of becoming highly inflationary economies.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:
Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $7 million as of December
31, 2021 and $31 million as of December 31, 2020. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $3,553 million
as of December 31, 2021 and $3,650 million as of December 31, 2020.
Allowances for Credit Losses:
The allowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region
level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted
economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write
off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.

Transfers of Financial Assets:
We account for transfers of financial assets, such as uncommitted revolving non-recourse accounts receivable factoring
arrangements, when we have surrendered control over the related assets. Determining whether control has transferred
requires an evaluation of relevant legal considerations, an assessment of the nature and extent of our continuing
involvement with the assets transferred and any other relevant considerations. We use receivable factoring
arrangements periodically when circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity. We have nonrecourse factoring
arrangements in which we sell eligible trade receivables primarily to banks in exchange for cash. We may then continue
to collect the receivables sold, acting solely as a collecting agent on behalf of the banks. The outstanding principal
amount of receivables under these arrangements amounted to $761 million as of December 31, 2021, $760 million as
of December 31, 2020 and $760 million as of December 31, 2019. The incremental costs of factoring receivables under
these arrangements were approximately $10 million in each of the years presented. The proceeds from the sales of
receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Inventories:
We record our inventory using the average cost method and record inventory allowances for overstock and obsolete
inventory.
Long-Lived Assets:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative
expenses depending on the nature of the long-lived assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods
ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years.
We review long-lived assets, including definite-life intangible assets, for realizability on an ongoing basis. Changes in
depreciation, generally accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful
lives or residual values of long-term assets change. We also review for impairment when conditions exist that indicate
the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. In those circumstances, we perform undiscounted
operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for asset impairment, we group assets
and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. Any impairment loss is calculated as
the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the discounted
cash flows for the asset group over the remaining useful life or based on the expected cash proceeds for the asset less
costs of disposal. Any significant impairment losses would be recorded within asset impairment and exit costs in the
consolidated statements of earnings.
Leases:
We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception. Our policy is to not recognize right-of-use
(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for short-term operating leases with terms of 12 months or less. Long-term
operating lease ROU assets and long-term operating lease liabilities are presented separately and operating lease
liabilities payable in the next twelve months are recorded in other current liabilities. Finance lease ROU assets are
83
Table of Contents
presented in property, plant and equipment and the related finance lease liabilities are presented in the current portion
of long-term debt and long-term debt.
Lease ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our
obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the
value of the lease liability, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred.
Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over
the lease term. The non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 as no fair value inputs are
observable. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our country-
specific incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term using information available at commencement date in
determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Many of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g.
product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement. Non-
lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for as a single lease component.
Amortization of ROU lease assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the expense recorded
in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest
expense is recorded over the lease term and is recorded in interest expense (based on a front-loaded interest expense
pattern) for finance leases and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses (on a
straight-line basis) for operating leases. All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are recorded
within cash flows from operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are recorded within cash flows from
financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Software Costs:
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or
obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment
and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:
We test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill
impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general
economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure
for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative
testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and
other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a
reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted
cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value.
In 2021, we performed a quantitative annual test. For our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-
based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations, and for our
Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of
individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and
economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting
unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.
Annually we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing
events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. If significant
potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated
fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using estimates of future sales, earnings growth
rates, royalty rates and discount rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset
impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. We amortize definite-life intangible assets over their
estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.
84
Table of Contents
Insurance and Self-Insurance:
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general
liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the
liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis by evaluating and making judgments about historical
claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results.
Revenue Recognition:
We predominantly sell food and beverage products across several product categories and in all regions as disclosed in
Note 18, Segment Reporting. We recognize revenue when control over the products transfers to our customers, which
generally occurs upon delivery or shipment of the products. A small percentage of our net revenues relates to the
licensing of our intellectual property, predominantly brand and trade names, and we record these revenues when
earned within the period of the license term. We account for product shipping, handling and insurance as fulfillment
activities with revenues for these activities recorded within net revenue and costs recorded within cost of sales. Any
taxes collected on behalf of government authorities are excluded from net revenues.
Revenues are recorded net of trade and sales incentives and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or
revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these
estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect revenue,
such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product
returns are realized.
Key sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer
arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter duration. As such, we do not capitalize contract
inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our inventory policies. We
generally do not have any unbilled receivables at the end of a period. Deferred revenues are not material and primarily
include customer advance payments typically collected a few days before product delivery, at which time deferred
revenues are reclassified and recorded as net revenues. We generally do not receive noncash consideration for the
sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year.
Marketing, Advertising and Research and Development:
We promote our products with marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to,
cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes,
advertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of
volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end
consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.
Advertising expense was $1,564 million in 2021, $1,376 million in 2020 and $1,208 million in 2019. We expense
product research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $347 million in 2021,
$332 million in 2020 and $351 million in 2019. We record marketing and advertising as well as research and
development expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses.
Stock-based Compensation:
Stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors is valued at fair value on the grant
date. We record stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period, generally three years. Forfeitures are
estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards.
Employee Benefit Plans:
We provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees including pension benefits, defined contribution
plan benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment primarily severance-related benefits depending
upon local statutory requirements, employee tenure and service requirements as well as other factors. The cost for
these plans is recognized in earnings primarily over the working life of the covered employee.
Financial Instruments:
We use financial instruments to manage our currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We
monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these
markets may have on our operating results. A principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce
significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity
prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments.
85
Table of Contents
We use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward
contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the
value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial
Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.
We record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our
asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is
recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to
our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items,
net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net
investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing
activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic
hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within
operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified
within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the
extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified
to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective
portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a
portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency
movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related
deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive
earnings/(losses).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument
and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document
the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives,
strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a
hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must
be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable
that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in
earnings.
When we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a
derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by
entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of
exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy
of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are
governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value
of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and
commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of
derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the
use of derivative instruments.
Commodity derivatives. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we
primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other
sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the
accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We
also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar
and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures
to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity
exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative
purposes.
Currency exchange derivatives. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange
rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency
exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use
these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc,
Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Any unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market impacts)
86
Table of Contents
and realized gains or losses are recorded in earnings (see Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional information).    
Interest rate cash flow and fair value hedges. We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the pricing or maturity
characteristics of certain liabilities so that the net impact on expense is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by
movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate liabilities appreciate or
depreciate in market value. We expect the effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation to be substantially offset
by our gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged liabilities. We use derivative
instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our
interest rate risk management strategy. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for
interest rate risk management. We use interest rate swaps to economically convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt into
variable-rate debt. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts, which is calculated based on an agreed-
upon notional amount. We use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion
of our future debt obligations. We also execute cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge interest payments on newly
issued debt denominated in a different currency than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. Substantially all of
these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Hedges of net investments in non-U.S. operations. We have numerous investments outside the United States. The net
assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. We use local currency
denominated debt to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We
designated our euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings as a net investment
hedge of a portion of our overall international operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these
designated international operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro, pound sterling, Swiss
franc and Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s value, net of deferred taxes, is recorded
in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).
We use derivatives instruments such as cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge certain investments
in our non-U.S. operations against movements in exchange rates. The after-tax gain/(loss) on these net investment
hedge contracts is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income and the
pre-tax impacts of the cash flows from these contracts are reported as other investing activities in the consolidated
statement of cash flows.
Income Taxes:
Our provision for income taxes includes amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effects of deferred
taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of our assets and liabilities,
operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.
The realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate
jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When assessing the
need for a valuation allowance, we consider any carryback potential, future reversals of existing taxable temporary
differences (including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits), future taxable income and tax planning strategies.
We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that
the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured
as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. Future changes
related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions could affect tax expense in the period when the change
occurs.
We monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. When there
is refinement to tax law changes in subsequent periods, we account for the new guidance in the period when it
becomes known.

New Accounting Pronouncements:
In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
which requires companies to recognize and measure customer contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a
business combination as if the acquiring company originated the related revenue contracts. Prior to adopting this ASU,
acquired contract assets and liabilities were measured at fair value. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the timing and effects of adopting this ASU and
currently we do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020 and subsequently in January 2021, the FASB issued an ASU to provide optional accounting guidance
for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The guidance provides
optional expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge
accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if
certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied as of the beginning of the interim period
including March 12, 2020, or any date thereafter, through December 31, 2022. We expect to adopt this standard in the
fourth quarter of 2022. Based on our evaluation of our contracts to date, we do not expect this ASU to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued an ASU that removes certain exceptions in accounting for income taxes, improves
consistency in application and clarifies existing guidance. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. On January 1, 2021, we adopted this ASU and it did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures
On January 3, 2022, we acquired 100% of equity of Chipita S.A. (“Chipita”), a leading croissants and baked snacks
company in the Central and Eastern European markets. The acquisition of Chipita offers a strategic complement to our
existing portfolio and advances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. The cash consideration
for Chipita totaled €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) plus the assumption of Chipita’s debt of €0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) totaling the
purchase price of €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). In 2021, we incurred acquisition-related costs of $6 million and integration
costs of $17 million in preparation for the acquisition.
On November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of MaxFoods Pty Ltd, an Australian packaged seafood business that we
had acquired as part of our acquisition of Gourmet Food Holdings Pty Ltd (“Gourmet Food”). The sales price was
$57 million Australian dollars ($41 million), net of cash divested with the business, and we recorded an immaterial loss
on the transaction. The packaged seafood business added incremental net revenues of $35 million in 2021 and
operating income of $5 million during 2021.
On April 1, 2021, we acquired Gourmet Food, a leading Australian food company in the premium biscuit and cracker
category, for closing cash consideration of approximately $450 million Australian dollars ($343 million), net of cash
received. We are working to complete the valuation and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $41
million to indefinite-lived intangible assets, $80 million to definite-lived intangible assets, $164 million to goodwill, $19
million to property, plant and equipment, $18 million to inventory, $25 million to accounts receivable, $12 million to other
assets, $5 million to operating right of use assets, $3 million to other current assets, $19 million to current liabilities and
$5 million to long-term operating lease liabilities. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $49 million and
operating income of $7 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $7 million in 2021.
On March 25, 2021, we acquired a majority interest in Lion/Gemstone Topco Ltd (“Grenade”), a performance nutrition
leader in the United Kingdom, for closing cash consideration of £188 million ($261 million), net of cash received. The
acquisition of Grenade expands our position into the premium nutrition market. We are working to complete the
valuation and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $82 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets,
$28 million to definite-lived intangible assets, $181 million to goodwill, $1 million to property, plant and equipment, $11
million to inventory, $18 million to accounts receivable, $25 million to current liabilities, $20 million to deferred tax
liabilities and $15 million to long-term other liabilities. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $67 million
and operating income of $6 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $2 million in 2021.

On January 4, 2021, we acquired the remaining 93% of equity of Hu Master Holdings (“Hu”), a category leader in
premium chocolate in the United States, which provides a strategic complement to our snacking portfolio in North
America through growth opportunities in chocolate and other offerings in the well-being category. The initial cash
consideration paid was $229 million, net of cash received, and we may be required to pay additional contingent
consideration. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date was $132
million and was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on forecasted future results. During 2021, based on
latest estimates, we recorded a $70 million reduction to the liability as recent economic and market conditions related to
COVID-19 and supply chain challenges in the U.S. have impacted the pace of growth. This reduction was recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result of acquiring the remaining equity interest, we consolidated the
operations prospectively from the date of acquisition and recorded a pre-tax gain of $9 million ($7 million after-tax)
related to stepping up our previously-held $8 million (7%) investment to fair value. We are working to complete the
valuation and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $123 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets,
$51 million to definite-lived intangible assets, $202 million to goodwill, $1 million to property, plant and equipment, $2
million to inventory, $4 million to accounts receivable, $5 million to current liabilities and $132 million to long-term other
liabilities. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $38 million and operating income (inclusive of the
adjustment to the contingent consideration liability) of $44 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of
$9 million in 2021.
On April 1, 2020, we acquired a majority interest in Give & Go, a North American leader in fully-finished sweet baked
goods and owner of the famous two-bite brand of brownies and the Create-A-Treat brand, known for cookie and
gingerbread house decorating kits. The acquisition of Give & Go provides access to the in-store bakery channel and
expands our position in broader snacking. The purchase consideration for Give & Go totaled $1,136 million, net of cash
received. We have recorded a purchase price allocation of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed as follows:
 (in millions)
Receivables $ 29 
Inventory 38
Other current assets 6
Property, plant and equipment 136
Operating right of use assets 61
Definite-life intangible assets 511
Indefinite-life intangible assets 42
Goodwill 531
Assets acquired $ 1,354 
Current liabilities 42
Deferred tax liabilities 92
Long-term operating lease liabilities 56
Long-term debt 6
Long-term other liabilities 19
Total purchase price $ 1,139 
Less: cash received 3
Net Cash Paid $ 1,136 
Within definite-life intangible assets, we allocated $416 million to customer relationships which have an estimated
useful life of 17 years. Goodwill arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across both new
and legacy product categories. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.® ®
89
Table of Contents
The fair value for customer relationships at the acquisition date was determined using the multi-period excess earnings
method under the income approach. The fair value measurements of intangible assets are based on significant
unobservable inputs, and thus represent Level 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of
intangible assets include discounted future cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates. Through the one-
year anniversary of the acquisition, Give & Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and operating income of
$6 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $15 million in 2020. We incurred acquisition integration
costs of $6 million in 2021 and $2 million in 2020.
On July 16, 2019, we acquired a majority interest in a U.S. refrigerated nutrition bar company, Perfect Snacks, within
our North America segment for $284 million cash paid, net of cash received, and expanded our position in broader
snacking. During the first quarter of 2020, we finalized the purchase price allocation of $31 million to definite-life
intangible assets, $107 million to indefinite-life intangible assets, $150 million to goodwill, $1 million to property, plant
and equipment, $12 million to inventory, $8 million to accounts receivable, $13 million to current liabilities, $3 million to
deferred tax liabilities and $9 million to other liabilities. Through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, Perfect
Snacks added incremental net revenues of $55 million and an immaterial amount of incremental operating income in
2020.
On May 28, 2019, we completed the sale of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa to Arla Foods of
Denmark. In 2019, we received cash proceeds of $161 million and divested $19 million of current assets and
$96 million of non-current assets. During 2019, we recorded a net pre-tax gain of $44 million on the sale. The
divestiture resulted in year-over-year declines in net revenues of $55 million and operating income of $9 million during
2020. We incurred divestiture-related costs of $4 million in 2020 and $6 million in 2019.

Note 5. Leases
We have operating and finance leases for manufacturing and distribution facilities, vehicles, equipment and office
space. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 to 18 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for
up to 6 years. We assume the majority of our termination options will not be exercised when determining the lease term
of our leases. We do not include significant restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, and residual value
guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases, with the exception of some fleet and equipment
leases. Some of our leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may
vary for other reasons, such as product costs, insurance and tax payments. These variable payment leases are not
included in our recorded lease assets and liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Certain leases are tied to a variable
index or rate and are included in our lease assets and liabilities based on the indices or rates as of lease
commencement.

Changes to goodwill and intangibles were:
•Divestitures – During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of MaxFoods Pty Ltd, an Australian
packaged seafood business that we had acquired as part of our acquisition of Gourmet Food, resulting in a
decrease in intangible assets of $17 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional
information.
•Acquisitions – In connection with our 2021 acquisitions of Gourmet Food, Grenade and the remaining interest
in Hu, we recorded preliminary purchase price allocations totaling $547 million of goodwill and $405 million of
intangible assets. In connection with our 2020 acquisition of a majority interest in Give & Go, we recorded a
purchase price allocation of $531 million to goodwill and $553 million to intangible assets. See Note 2,
Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information.
•Asset impairments – As further discussed below, we recorded $32 million of intangible asset impairments in
2021 and $144 million in 2020.
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no goodwill impairments and each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in
excess of its carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business
performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates,
change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a
goodwill impairment in the future.
In 2021, we recorded $32 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to one biscuit brand in North America.
We also identified eight brands with $1,146 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2021 that each had a
fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We continue to monitor our brand performance, particularly in light of
the significant uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our business. If a brand's earnings
expectations, including the timing of the expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic impacts, are not met or
specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands
could become impaired in the future. In 2020, we recorded $144 million of impairment charges for gum, chocolate,
biscuits and candy brands of $83 million in North America, $53 million in Europe, $5 million in AMEA and $3 million in
Latin America. In 2019, we recorded $57 million of impairment charges for gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands
of $39 million in Europe, $15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America.

Note 7. Equity Method Investments
Equity method investments consist of our investments in entities in which we maintain an equity ownership interest and
apply the equity method of accounting due to our ability to exert significant influence over decisions relating to their
operating and financial affairs. Revenue and expenses of our equity method investees are not consolidated into our
financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of the earnings of each investee is reflected as equity method
investment net earnings. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also impacted by our proportionate
share of items impacting the investee's accumulated other comprehensive income or losses and other items, such as
our share of investee dividends.
Our equity method investments include, but are not limited to, our ownership interests in JDE Peet’s (Euronext
Amsterdam: “JDEP”), Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (Nasdaq: “KDP”), Dong Suh Foods Corporation and Dong Suh Oil & Fats
Co. Ltd. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 22.8%, 5.3%, 50.0% and 49.0%, respectively, of these companies'
outstanding shares.
Our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled $5,289 million as of December 31, 2021
and $6,036 million as of December 31, 2020. We recorded equity earnings and cash dividends of $393 million and
$172 million in 2021, equity earnings and cash dividends of $421 million and $246 million in 2020 and equity earnings
and cash dividends of $501 million and $250 million in 2019.
Based on the quoted closing prices as of December 31, 2021, the combined fair value of our publicly-traded
investments in JDEP and KDP was $6.3 billion, and for each investment, its fair value exceeded its carrying value.
JDE / Keurig Exchange:
On March 7, 2016, we exchanged a portion of our 43.5% JDE equity interest for a new equity interest in Keurig Green
Mountain, Inc. (“Keurig”). Following the transaction, our JDE equity interest became 26.5% and our new Keurig equity
interest was 24.2%. During 2016, we recorded the difference between the $2.0 billion fair value of Keurig and our basis
in the exchanged JDE shares as a gain of $43 million. During 2019, we determined an adjustment to accumulated
other comprehensive losses related to our JDE investment was required, which reduced our previously reported gain
by $29 million. We recorded the adjustment as a loss on equity method transactions.
Keurig Dr Pepper Transactions:

JDE Peet’s Transaction:
In May 2020, JDE Peet’s B.V. (renamed JDE Peet’s N.V. immediately prior to Settlement (as defined below), “JDE
Peet’s”) consummated the offering, listing and trading of its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, a regulated
market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. In connection with this transaction, JDE Peet’s and the selling
shareholders, including us, agreed to sell at a price of €31.50 per ordinary share a total of approximately 82.1 million
ordinary shares, including ordinary shares subject to an over-allotment option. The ordinary shares were listed and first
traded on May 29, 2020, and payment for, and delivery of, the ordinary shares sold in the offering (excluding ordinary
shares subject to the over-allotment option) took place on June 2, 2020 (“Settlement”).
Prior to Settlement, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet’s. We
did not invest new capital in connection with the transaction and the exchange was accounted for as a change in
interest transaction. Upon Settlement, we sold approximately 9.7 million of our ordinary shares in JDE Peet’s in the
offering for gross proceeds of €304 million ($343 million). We subsequently sold approximately 1.4 million additional
shares and received gross proceeds of €46 million ($51 million) upon exercise of the over-allotment option. Following
Settlement and the exercise of the over-allotment option, we held a 22.9% equity interest in JDE Peet’s. During the
second quarter of 2020, we recorded a preliminary gain of $121 million, net of $33 million released from accumulated
other comprehensive losses, and $48 million of transaction costs. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our
preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million.
On September 20, 2021, we issued €300 million exchangeable bonds, which are redeemable at maturity at their
principal amount in cash or, at our option, through the delivery of an equivalent number of JDE Peet’s ordinary shares
based on an initial exchange price of €35.40 and, as the case may be, an additional amount in cash. If all bonds were
redeemed in exchange for JDE Peet's shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately
7% of our equity interest in JDE Peet's. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for further details on this
transaction.
As was the case in our ownership interest in JDE, we have significant influence with respect to JDE Peet’s, and we will
continue to account for our investment in JDE Peet’s under the equity method, resulting in recognizing our share of
JDE Peet’s earnings within our earnings and our share of JDE Peet’s dividends within our cash flows.

Note 8. Restructuring Program
On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion 2014-2018 restructuring program and up to $2.2 billion
of capital expenditures. On August 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $600 million reallocation between
restructuring program cash costs and capital expenditures so the $5.7 billion program consisted of approximately $4.1
billion of restructuring program costs ($3.1 billion cash costs and $1.0 billion non-cash costs) and up to $1.6 billion of
capital expenditures. On September 6, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring
program through 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion in the program charges and an increase of $700 million in capital
expenditures. On October 21, 2021, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring program through
2023. The total $7.7 billion program now consists of $5.4 billion of program charges ($4.1 billion of cash costs and $1.3
billion of non-cash costs) and total capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to be incurred over the life of the program. The
current restructuring program, as increased and extended by these actions, is now called the Simplify to Grow
Program.
The primary objective of the Simplify to Grow Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain
and overhead costs. The program covers severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing and
procurement-related one-time costs. Since inception, we have incurred total restructuring and related implementation
charges of $5.0 billion related to the Simplify to Grow Program. We expect to incur the remainder of the program
charges by year-end 2023.

•We recorded restructuring charges of $154 million in 2021, $156 million in 2020 and $176 million in 2019 within
asset impairment and exit costs and benefit plan non-service income.
•We spent $160 million in 2021 and $169 million in 2020 in cash severance and related costs.
•In 2021, we recognized non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments),
non-cash pension settlement losses and other non-cash adjustments, partially offset by gains on sale of assets,
primarily real estate, included in the restructuring program totaling $73 million. In 2020, we recognized a gain on
sale of assets included in the restructuring program, partially offset by noncash asset write-downs (including
accelerated depreciation and asset impairments), non-cash pension settlement losses and other non-cash
adjustments totaling $6 million.
•At December 31, 2021, $180 million of our net restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities and
$31 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.
Implementation Costs:
Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special
accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers
of our financial statements with more information on the total costs of our Simplify to Grow Program. Implementation
costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention
program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to
the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simplification of our information systems. Within our
continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $167 million in 2021, $207 million in 2020 and
$272 million in 2019. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and general corporate expense within selling,
general and administrative expenses.
Restructuring and Implementation Costs in Operating Income:
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, and since inception of the Simplify to Grow Program, we recorded the following

$24.6 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses), the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles and
earnings/(losses) recognized in connection with the ongoing application of any mark-to-market accounting for pensions and other retirement
plans. At December 31, 2021, we complied with this covenant as our shareholders' equity, as defined by the covenant, was $38.9 billion. The
revolving credit facility also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. There are no credit rating triggers, provisions or

Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options. The fair value
of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.
Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter (“OTC”) currency exchange forwards,
options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our
currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the
contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on
the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on
pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are
valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires
assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of
price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet’s shares over the life of the option. Our
calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of
the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments
takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions
are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under
these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative
contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives
by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure
with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

(1)In 2020 we reviewed the impact of market changes on design features of certain historical defined contribution plans. The review resulted in
additional plans being accounted for as defined benefit pension plans, which resulted in increases of $133 million in the projected benefit
obligation and $125 million in plan assets in 2020.(1)

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, for U.S. pension plans
was $1,723 million at December 31, 2021 and $1,882 million at December 31, 2020. The accumulated benefit
obligation for non-U.S. pension plans was $10,650 million at December 31, 2021 and $11,404 million at December 31,
2020.
The actuarial (gain) loss for all pension plans in 2020 and 2021 was primarily related to a change in the discount rate
used to measure the benefit obligations of those plans.
Salaried and non-union hourly employees hired after January 1, 2009 in the U.S. and after January 1, 2011 in Canada
(or earlier for certain legacy Cadbury employees) are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension
plans. Benefit accruals for salaried and non-union hourly employee participants in the U.S. and Canada defined benefit
pension plans ceased on December 31, 2019. These employees instead receive Company contributions to the
employee defined contribution plans.
The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net pension asset of $297 million at December 31, 2021
and a net pension liability of $614 million at December 31, 2020. We recognized these amounts in our consolidated
balance sheets as follows:
 As of December 31,
 2021 2020
 (in millions)
Prepaid pension assets $ 1,009 $ 672 
Other current liabilities (31) (29)
Accrued pension costs (681) (1,257)
$ 297 $ (614)
Certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans are underfunded with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.
For these plans, the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets
were:
 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans

Accumulated benefit obligation 42 51 1,805 3,873 
Fair value of plan assets 3 3 1,223 2,827 
We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our benefit obligations under the pension plans:
 U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
 As of December 31, As of December 31,
 2021 2020 2021 2020
Discount rate 3.01 % 2.73 % 1.73 % 1.33 %
Expected rate of return on plan assets 4.50 % 4.50 % 3.44 % 3.90 %
Rate of compensation increase 4.00 % 4.00 % 2.83 % 3.16 %
Year-end discount rates for our U.S., Canadian, Eurozone and U.K. plans were developed from a model portfolio of
high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit
obligations. Year-end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S. plans were developed from local bond indices that
match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of
changes in bond yields year-over-year. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’
historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset
class.

For the periods presented, we measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along a yield
curve used to measure plan obligations to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more
precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the
corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.
Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost:
Net periodic pension cost consisted of the following:

(1)During the third quarter of 2021, we terminated our Defined Benefit Pension Scheme in Nigeria. During the second quarter of 2021, we made a
decision to freeze our Defined Benefit Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom. As a result, we recognized curtailment credits of ($17 million) in
2021 recorded within benefit plan non-service income. In connection with the United Kingdom plan freeze, we also incurred incentive payment
charges and other expenses of $48 million in 2021 included in operating income.
For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a
calculated market return value that recognizes the cost over a four-year period. For our non-U.S. plans, we utilize a
similar approach with varying cost recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine the expected
return on plan assets based on asset fair values as of the measurement date.
We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our net periodic pension cost:

Fair value measurements
•Level 1 – includes primarily U.S and non-U.S. equity securities and government bonds valued using quoted prices
in active markets.
•Level 2 – includes primarily pooled funds, including assets in real estate pooled funds, valued using net asset
values of participation units held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of the trusts and as
supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Level 2 plan assets also include corporate
bonds and other fixed-income securities, valued using independent observable market inputs, such as matrix
pricing, yield curves and indices.
•Level 3 – includes investments valued using unobservable inputs that reflect the plans’ assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the assets, based on the best information available.
•Fair value estimates for pooled funds are calculated by the investment advisor when reliable quotations or
pricing services are not readily available for certain underlying securities. The estimated value is based on
either cost or last sale price for most of the securities valued in this fashion.
•Fair value estimates for private equity investments are calculated by the general partners using the market
approach to estimate the fair value of private investments. The market approach utilizes prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions, type of security, degree of liquidity, restrictions on the
disposition, latest round of financing data, company financial statements, relevant valuation multiples and
discounted cash flow analyses.
•Fair value estimates for private debt placements are calculated using standardized valuation methods,
including but not limited to income-based techniques such as discounted cash flow projections or market-based
techniques utilizing public and private transaction multiples as comparables.
•Fair value estimates for real estate investments are calculated by investment managers using the present
value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investments, based on valuation methodologies
such as appraisals, local market conditions, and current and projected operating performance.
•Fair value estimates for fixed-income securities that are buy-in annuity policies are calculated on a replacement
policy value basis by discounting the projected cash flows of the plan members using a discount rate based on
risk-free rates and adjustments for estimated levels of insurer pricing.
•Net asset value – primarily includes equity funds, fixed income funds, real estate funds, hedge funds and private
equity investments for which net asset values are normally used.

For our U.S. plans, our investment strategy is to reduce our funded status risk in part through appropriate asset
allocation within our plan assets. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset
classes as we make monthly benefit payments. The strategy involves using indexed U.S. equity and international
equity securities and actively managed U.S. investment grade fixed-income securities (which constitute 95% or more of
fixed-income securities) with smaller allocations to high yield fixed-income securities.
For our non-U.S. plans, the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans
in each individual country. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as
a mix of approximately 15% equity securities, 58% fixed-income securities, 24% buy-in annuity policies and 3% real
estate.
Employer Contributions:
In 2021, we contributed $10 million to our U.S. pension plans and $271 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. In
addition, employees contributed $21 million to our non-U.S. plans. We make contributions to our pension plans in
accordance with local funding arrangements and statutory minimum funding requirements. Discretionary contributions
are made to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability. In 2022, we estimate that
our pension contributions will be $3 million to our U.S. plans and $185 million to our non-U.S. plans based on current
tax laws. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws,
significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

Non-U.S. Plans 422 414 425 430 443 2,266
Multiemployer Pension Plans:
In accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we made contributions to
multiemployer pension plans for continuing participation of $4 million in 2021, $5 million in 2020 and $5 million in 2019.
Our contributions are based on our contribution rates under our collective bargaining agreements, the number of our
eligible employees and fund surcharges.
In 2018, we executed a complete withdrawal from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International
Pension Fund and recorded a $429 million estimated withdrawal liability. On July 11, 2019, we received an
undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments
over 19 years. We began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. Within selling, general and
administrative expenses, we recorded a $35 million ($26 million net of tax) adjustment related to the discounted
withdrawal liability. Within interest and other expense, net, we recorded accreted interest of $11 million in 2021,
$11 million in 2020 and $12 million in 2019. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was
$360 million, with $14 million recorded in other current liabilities and $346 million recorded in long-term other liabilities.

Other Costs:
We sponsor and contribute to employee defined contribution plans. These plans cover eligible salaried, non-union and
union employees. Our contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by
the plans. Amounts charged to expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $73 million in
2021, $83 million in 2020 and $72 million in 2019.

The actuarial (gain) for all postretirement plans in 2020 and 2021 was driven by gains related to assumption changes
partially offset by losses related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations of those plans.
We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations:

Year-end discount rates for our U.S., Canadian and U.K. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality,
fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Year-
end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S. plans were developed from local bond indices that match local benefit
obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields
year-over-year. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs.
For the periods presented, we measure service and interest costs for other postretirement benefits by applying the
specific spot rates along a yield curve used to measure plan obligations to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this
approach provides a good measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash
flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.

cost increases of 4.0% in 2021 and 2020 and assumed benefits as defined in the respective plans.
Postemployment costs arising from actions that offer employees benefits in excess of those specified in the respective
plans are charged to expense when incurred.

approximately $4 million.
Note 12. Stock Plans
Under our Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), we are authorized through
May 21, 2024 to issue a maximum of 243.7 million shares of our Class A common stock (“Common Stock”) to
employees and non-employee directors. As of December 31, 2021, there were 48.9 million shares available to be
granted under the 2005 Plan.
Stock Options:
Stock options (including stock appreciation rights) are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying stock on the grant date, generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first
anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of ten years.
We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes
methodology or a Lattice Model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock
options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense
related to stock options held by our employees of $23 million in 2021, $28 million in 2020 and $38 million in 2019 in our
results from continuing operations. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $4
million in 2021, $5 million in 2020 and $8 million in 2019. The unamortized compensation expense related to our
employee stock options was $21 million at December 31, 2021 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-
average period of 1.6 years.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes and Lattice Model fair value assumptions were:
 Risk-Free
Interest Rate Expected LifeExpected
VolatilityExpected
Dividend YieldFair Value
at Grant Date
2021 0.57% 5 years 23.45% 2.20% $9.08
2020 1.34% 5 years 19.64% 2.06% $8.61
2019 2.46 % 5 years 19.96 % 2.37 % $7.83
The risk-free interest rate represents the constant maturity U.S. government treasuries rate with a remaining term equal
to the expected life of the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their
options. Volatility reflects historical movements in our stock price for a period commensurate with the expected life of
the options. The dividend yield reflects the dividend yield in place at the time of the historical grants.

$40 million in 2019.
Deferred Stock Units, Performance Share Units and Other Stock-Based Awards:
Deferred stock units granted to eligible employees have most shareholder rights, except that they may not sell, assign,
pledge or otherwise encumber the shares and our deferred stock units do not have voting rights until vested. Deferred
stock units are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Deferred stock units generally vest on
the third anniversary of the grant date. Performance share units granted under our 2005 Plan vest based on varying
performance, market and service conditions. The unvested performance share units have no voting rights and do not
pay dividends. Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid only after the performance share
units vest.
The fair value of the deferred stock units, performance share units and other stock-based awards at the date of grant is
amortized to earnings over the vesting period. The fair value of our deferred stock units and other stock-based awards
is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Performance share unit awards generally
have targets tied to both performance and market-based conditions. For market condition components, market volatility
and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation
expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has
been provided. For performance condition components, we estimate the probability that the performance conditions will
be achieved each quarter and adjust compensation expenses accordingly. The grant date fair value of performance
share units is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return
component and the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date for performance-based components. The
number of performance share units that ultimately vest ranges from 0-200 percent of the number granted, based on the
achievement of the performance and market-based components.(1)

We recorded compensation expense related to deferred stock units, performance share units and other stock-based
awards of $98 million in 2021, $98 million in 2020 and $97 million in 2019 in our results from continuing operations. The
deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $16 million in 2021, $15 million in 2020 and
$16 million in 2019. The unamortized compensation expense related to our deferred stock units, performance share
units and other stock-based awards was $107 million at December 31, 2021 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Share Repurchase Program:
Between 2013 and 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of a total of $13.7 billion of our Common
Stock through December 31, 2018. On January 31, 2018, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from
our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization
to $19.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2020. On
December 2, 2020, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $4.0 billion in the share repurchase program,
raising the authorization to $23.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through
December 31, 2023. Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary.
Prior to January 1, 2021, we had repurchased approximately $18.0 billion of Common Stock pursuant to this
authorization. During 2021, we repurchased approximately 35.4 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of
$59.24 per share, or an aggregate cost of approximately $2.1 billion, all of which was paid during the period except for
approximately $16 million settled in January 2022. All share repurchases were funded through available cash and
commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $3.7 billion in remaining share
repurchase capacity.

Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings:
We routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters and governmental inspections or
investigations arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to our business, including those noted below in this section.
We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an
unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For matters we have not
provided for that are reasonably possible to result in an unfavorable outcome, management is unable to estimate the
possible loss or range of loss or such amounts have been determined to be immaterial. At present we believe that the
ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. However, legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent
uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial
monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could
include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways,
precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome might result in a material
adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position.
On April 1, 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) filed a complaint against Kraft Foods
Group and Mondelēz Global LLC (“Mondelēz Global”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the
“District Court”), Eastern Division (the “CFTC action”) following its investigation of activities related to the trading of
December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the spin-off of Kraft Foods Group. The complaint alleges
that Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the
fall of 2011; (2) violated position limit levels for wheat futures and (3) engaged in non-competitive trades by trading both
sides of exchange-for-physical Chicago Board of Trade wheat contracts. The CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties of
either triple the monetary gain for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”) or $1 million for each
violation of Section 6(c)(1), 6(c)(3) or 9(a)(2) of the Act and $140,000 for each additional violation of the Act, plus post-
judgment interest; an order of permanent injunction prohibiting Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global from violating
specified provisions of the Act; disgorgement of profits; and costs and fees. On August 15, 2019, the District Court
approved a settlement agreement between the CFTC and Mondelēz Global. The terms of the settlement, which are
available in the District Court’s docket, had an immaterial impact on our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows. On October 23, 2019, following a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
regarding Mondelēz Global's allegations that the CFTC and its Commissioners violated certain terms of the settlement
agreement and the CFTC's argument that the Commissioners were not bound by the terms of the settlement
agreement, the District Court vacated the settlement agreement and reinstated all pending motions that the District
Court had previously mooted as a result of the settlement. The parties have reached a new agreement in principle to
resolve the CFTC action and have submitted the settlement to the District Court for approval. The District Court
cancelled a scheduled conference on June 4, 2020 to discuss the proposed settlement agreement but indicated that it
would rule on pending motions in due course. Additionally, several class action complaints were filed against Kraft
Foods Group and Mondelēz Global in the District Court by investors in wheat futures and options on behalf of
themselves and others similarly situated. The complaints make similar allegations as those made in the CFTC action,
and the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages, interest and unjust enrichment; costs and fees; and injunctive,
declaratory and other unspecified relief. In June 2015, these suits were consolidated in the District Court. On January
3, 2020, the District Court granted plaintiffs' request to certify a class. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these
matters; however, based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement with Kraft Foods Group dated as of September
27, 2012, we expect to bear any monetary penalties or other payments in connection with the CFTC action and the
class action. Although the CFTC action and the class action complaints involve the same alleged conduct, a resolution
or decision with respect to one of the matters may not be dispositive as to the outcome of the other matter.
In November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it has initiated an investigation into our alleged
infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices restricting cross-border trade within the
European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it has taken the next
procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. We are cooperating with the investigation and
expect to continue to engage with the European Commission as its investigation proceeds. It is not possible to predict
how long the investigation will take or the ultimate outcome of this matter.

Third-Party Guarantees:
We enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these
transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At
December 31, 2021, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
Tax Matters:
We are a party to various tax matter proceedings incidental to our business. These proceedings are subject to inherent
uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could subject us to additional tax liabilities and could materially adversely
impact our business, results of operations or financial position.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we resolved several indirect tax matters and recorded $85 million of net indirect tax
expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Note 16. Income Taxes
On August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On
September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote
regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes
was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter
referred to as “Swiss tax reform”. Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is our position that enactment of Swiss
tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third
quarter of 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred
tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and
remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and
administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1,
2020. With the acquisition of Chipita in January 2022 (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures), we believe there
is a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset
for the step-up of intangible assets will no longer be needed. The amount of the valuation allowance to be released in
2022 is dependent on the increase in Switzerland's future taxable income.

The effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate as follows:

U.S. federal statutory rate 21.0% 21.0% 21.0%

Changes in judgment on realizability of deferred tax assets 0.1% (2.2)% (0.3)%
Reversal of other tax accruals no longer required (0.5)% (0.8)% (3.0)%
Tax accrual on investment in KDP (including tax impact of
   share sales) 4.7% 6.7% 0.8%
Excess tax benefits from equity compensation (0.7)% (1.0)% (1.2)%
Tax legislation (non-Swiss tax reform) 2.3% 1.0% 0.4%
Swiss tax reform — — (22.3)%
Business sales (including tax impact from JDE Peet's transaction) — 7.4% —
Foreign tax provisions under TCJA (GILTI, FDII and BEAT) 0.8% 1.1% 2.5%
Other — 0.3% 0.7%
Effective tax rate 27.2% 36.2% 0.1%
(1) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) established the Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (“GILTI”) provision, which taxes U.S. allocated
expenses and certain income from foreign operations; the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) provision, which allows a deduction against
certain types of U.S. taxable income resulting in a lower effective U.S. tax rate on such income; and the Base Erosion Anti-abuse Tax (“BEAT”),
which is a minimum tax based on cross-border service payments by U.S. entities.
Our 2021 effective tax rate of 27.2% was high due to the $187 million net tax expense incurred in connection with the
KDP share sales during the second and third quarters. Excluding this impact, our effective tax rate was 23.0%, which
reflects unfavorable provisions from the 2017 U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments
(these earnings are reported separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before
income taxes), largely offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The
23.0% includes a discrete net tax benefit of $2 million, primarily driven by a $47 million net benefit from the release of
liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several
jurisdictions and a $44 million benefit from two U.S. tax returns amended to reflect new guidance from the U.S.
Treasury Department, offset by $100 million net tax expense from the increase of our deferred tax liabilities resulting
from enacted tax legislation (mainly in the United Kingdom).
Our 2020 effective tax rate of 36.2% was high due to the $452 million net tax expense incurred in connection with the
JDE Peet's transaction and four KDP share sales that occurred during 2020 (the related gains were reported as gains
on equity method investments). Excluding these impacts, our effective tax rate was 22.8%, which reflects unfavorable
provisions from U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments (these earnings are reported
separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before income taxes), largely offset by
favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and discrete net tax benefits of
$119 million. The discrete net benefits were primarily driven by the $70 million net benefit from the release of the China
valuation allowance and a $50 million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to
expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions.
Our 2019 effective tax rate of 0.1% was significantly impacted by the $769 million net deferred tax benefit related to
Swiss tax reform in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding this impact, our 2019 effective tax rate was 22.4%, which
reflects unfavorable provisions from U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments (these
earnings are reported separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before income
taxes), largely offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and discrete
net tax benefits of $176 million. The discrete net tax benefits were primarily driven by a $128 million net benefit from the
release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in
several jurisdictions.(1)

Total deferred income tax liabilities (4,303) (4,211)
Net deferred income tax liabilities $ (2,903)$ (2,556)
Our significant valuation allowances are in the U.S. and Switzerland. The U.S. valuation allowance mainly relates to
excess foreign tax credits generated by the deemed repatriation under U.S. tax reform while the Swiss valuation
allowance brings the allowed step-up of intangible assets recorded under Swiss tax reform to the amount more likely
than not to be realized.
At December 31, 2021, the Company has pre-tax loss carryforwards of $2,935 million, of which $171 million will expire
at various dates between 2022 and 2041 and the remaining $2,764 million can be carried forward indefinitely.
The unremitted earnings as of December 31, 2021 in those subsidiaries where we continue to be indefinitely reinvested
is approximately $1.7 billion. We currently have not recognized approximately $121 million of deferred tax liabilities
related to those unremitted earnings. Future tax law changes or changes in the needs of our non-U.S. subsidiaries
could require us to recognize deferred tax liabilities on a portion, or all, of our accumulated earnings that are currently
indefinitely reinvested.

As of January 1, 2021, our unrecognized tax benefits were $442 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the
net impact on our income tax provision would have been $369 million. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $446 million
at December 31, 2021, and if we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision would
have been $372 million. Within the next 12 months, our unrecognized tax benefits could increase by approximately $35
million due to unfavorable audit developments or decrease by approximately $65 million due to audit settlements and
the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We include accrued interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $170 million as of January 1,
2021 and $173 million as of December 31, 2021. Our 2021 provision for income taxes included $11 million expense for
interest and penalties.
In connection with the 2017 enacted U.S. tax reform, we recorded a $1.3 billion transition tax liability that is payable in
installments through 2026. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining liability was approximately $720 million.
Our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities. U.S. federal, state and
non-U.S. jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years; however, these statutes are
often extended by mutual agreement with the tax authorities. The earliest year still open to examination by U.S. federal
and state tax authorities is 2016 and years still open to examination by non-U.S. tax authorities in major jurisdictions
include (earliest open tax year in parentheses): China (2011), France (2015), India (2005), the United Kingdom (2015)
and Switzerland (2016).

Note 18. Segment Reporting
We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks),
chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products.
We manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units. We manage our operations by
region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively
and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have
responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.

Table of Contents
Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:
•Latin America
•AMEA
•Europe
•North America
We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is
appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating
income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general
corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible
assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of
selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating
income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage
benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by
segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.
Our segment net revenues and earnings, reflecting our current segment structure for all periods presented, were:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO,
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021. Based on
this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2021.
Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those
written policies and procedures that:
 
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of assets;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
•provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
management and director authorization; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.
Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in
Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). The scope of Management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting excludes
0.2% of the Company’s consolidated total assets and 0.5% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues related to the
2021 acquired businesses of Hu, Grenade and Gourmet Food.
Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, as stated in their report that appears under Item 8.
