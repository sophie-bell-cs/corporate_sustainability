Our Company
We are a global energy technology company. We deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation,
storage and communication on one single platform. We revolutionized the solar industry with our microinverter technology
and we produce a fully integrated solar-plus-storage solution. To date, we have shipped more than 32 million
microinverters, and approximately 1.4 million Enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more
than 130 countries.
COVID-19 update
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) continues to cause disruptions and uncertainties, including in the
core markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and
services and had a notable impact on general economic conditions including but not limited to the temporary closures of
many businesses, “shelter in place” orders and other governmental regulations, and reduced consumer spending. The
most significant near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our financial performance are a decline in sales orders as future
residential and commercial system owners are canceling sales meetings with system installation professionals or
postponing system installations. As the purchase of new solar energy management solutions declines as part of the impact
of COVID-19 on consumer spending, many businesses through which we distribute our products are working at limited
operational capacity. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance will depend
on various future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, duration of employees working
remotely, impact on our customers, effect on our sales cycles or costs, and effect on our supply chain and vendors, all of
which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, but which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition. Further information relating to the risks and uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic may be found in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Background
Historically, traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic (“PV”)
installations. In an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter, the solar PV modules are connected in series
strings. In a large installation, there are multiple series strings connected in parallel. The aggregated voltage from each of
these strings is then fed into a large central inverter. We believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design
and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems, including the
following:
•Productivity limits. If solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter—group or “string” of modules are
wired in series, and an entire string’s output is limited by the output of the lowest-performing module. Because of
its string design, there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional central inverter approach.
•Reliability issues. Traditional central inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail,
resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output. As a result, central inverters typically
carry warranties of only 5 to 10 years.
•Complex design and installation requirements. The central inverter-based solar PV installation requires greater
effort on the part of the installer, both in terms of design and on-site labor. Central inverter installations require
string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation, as well as specialized equipment such as DC
combiners, conduits and disconnects. In addition, the use of high-voltage direct current (“DC”) requires
specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology.
•Lack of monitoring. The majority of solar installations with central inverter technology offer limited monitoring
capabilities. If a module in a central inverter system fails or is not performing to specification, the resulting loss of
energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 7
Table of Contents
•Safety issues. Central inverter solar PV installations have a wide distribution of high-voltage (600 volts to 1,000
volts) DC wiring. If damaged, DC wires can generate sustained electrical arcs, reaching temperatures of more
than 5,000 °F. This creates the risk of fire for solar PV installation owners and injury for installers and
maintenance personnel.
These challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment
of solar installations to both installers and system owners:
•Installer. Solar PV installers aim for simple installation design, fast installation times and maximum system
performance and predictability. The installation of high-voltage DC central inverter technology, however, requires
significant preparation, precautionary safety measures, time-consuming string calculations, extensive design
expertise and specialized installation equipment, training and knowledge. Together, these factors significantly
increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer.
•System owner. Solar power system owners aim for high energy production, low cost, high reliability, and low
maintenance requirements, as well as reduced fire risks. With traditional central inverters, owners often are
unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar PV installations due to string design limitations. As such, they
experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions, can face frequent system failures and lack the
ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar PV installation. In addition, central inverter installations
operate at high-voltage DC which bears significant fire risks. Further, due to their large size, central inverter
installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building.
The solar industry is transitioning from solar only systems to complete energy management solutions, which consist
of solar-plus storage and load control.
Our Products
We design, develop, manufacture and sell home energy solutions that manage energy generation, energy storage
and control and communications on one intelligent platform. We have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a
systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductor-based microinverter that converts energy at the
individual solar module level and, combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies, provides advanced
energy monitoring and control. This is vastly different than a central inverter system using string modules, with or without
an optimizer, approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical
unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array. The Enphase Home Energy Solution with
IQ™ platform, which is our current generation integrated solar, storage and energy management offering, enables self-
consumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy, simplifying design and installation, and
improving system uptime and reliability. The IQ family of microinverters, like all of our previous microinverters, is fully
compliant with NEC 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements. Unlike string inverters, this capability is built-in, with no
additional equipment necessary.
The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ™ brings a high technology, networked approach to solar generation
plus energy storage, by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics, semiconductors and cloud-based
software technologies. Our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home’s energy potential while providing
advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities. The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ uses a single
technology platform for seamless management of the whole solution, enabling rapid commissioning with the Installer
Toolkit™; consumption monitoring with our Envoy™ Communications Gateway with IQ Combiner+, Enphase Enlighten, a
cloud-based energy management platform, and our Enphase AC Battery™. System owners can use Enphase Enlighten to
monitor their home’s solar generation, energy storage and consumption from any web-enabled device. Unlike some of our
competitors, who utilize a traditional inverter, or offer separate components of solutions, we have built-in system
redundancy in both PV generation and energy storage, eliminating the risk that comes with a single-point of failure. Further,
the nature of our cloud-based, monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates, enabling cost-effective
remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance.
The Enphase IQ 7™ microinverter and Enphase IQ 7+™ microinverter, part of our seventh-generation IQ product
family, support high-powered 60-cell and 72-cell solar modules and integrate with alternating current (“AC”) modules. Our
IQ 7X™ microinverter addresses 96-cell photovoltaic (“PV”) modules up to 400W direct DC and with its 97.5% California
Energy Commission (“CEC”) efficiency rating, is ideal for integration into high power modules.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8
Table of Contents
During 2020, we started shipping our IQ 7A™ for high-power monofacial and bifacial solar modules to customers in
Australia and Europe. Our IQ 7A microinverters, which began shipping to customers in North America in November 2019,
support up to 450W high-power modules, targeting high-power residential and commercial applications. Our customers will
be able to pair the IQ 7A microinverter with monofacial or bifacial solar modules, up to 450 W, from solar module
manufacturers who are expected to introduce high-power variants of their products in the next three years.
AC Module (“ACM”) products are integrated systems which allow installers to be more competitive through improved
logistics, reduced installation times, faster inspection and training. We continued to make steady progress during the fourth
quarter of 2020 with our ACM partners, including SunPower Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, LONGi
Solar, Solaria Corporation, Hanwha Q CELLS, and Maxeon Solar Technologies, Sonnenstromfabrik (CS Wismar GmBH),
and DMEGC Solar.
During 2020, we introduced to customers in North America our Enphase storage system, featuring our Ensemble™
management technology, which powers the world’s first grid-independent microinverter-based storage system. Our next-
generation battery in North America is Enphase Encharge 10™ or Encharge 3™ storage systems, with usable and scalable
capacity of 10.1 kWh and 3.4 kWh, respectively. Enphase Encharge™ storage systems feature Enphase embedded grid-
forming microinverters that enable the Always-On capability that keeps homes powered when the grid goes down, and the
ability to save money when the grid is up. These systems are compatible with both new and existing Enphase IQ solar
systems with IQ 6™, IQ 7™, M215 and M250 microinverters and provide a simple upgrade path for our existing solar
customers. We started production shipments of Enphase Encharge storage systems to customers in North America during
the second quarter of 2020.
We expect further revisions of our storage products with Ensemble technology to be released in 2021, with a focus
on the grid-agnostic IQ 8 PV microinverter for residential installations. Our next-generation IQ 8™ system is based upon
our Always On Enphase Ensemble™ energy management technology. This system has five components: 1) energy
generation, which is accomplished with the grid-agnostic microinverter IQ 8; 2) energy storage, which is achieved by the
Encharge™ battery with capacities of 10.1 kWh and 3.4 kWh; 3) Enpower™ smart switch, which includes a microgrid
interconnect device (“MID”); 4) communication and control via the combiner box with the Envoy gateway; and 5) Enlighten,
which is the internet of things (“IoT”), cloud software.
The advantage of IQ 8s on the roof will be that these grid-forming microinverters produce power from panels even
during blackouts, as long as the sun is still shining. It addresses a major drawback of traditional solar installations without
the need for storage and is differentiated in that respect.
We also expect to introduce both Enphase IQ 8D™ for commercial solar purposes and Ensemble-in-a Box, an off-
grid solar and storage system.

Customers and Sales
We currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central
American markets, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India and certain other Asian markets. We sell our solutions primarily
to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators, who in turn integrate our products into complete solar PV
installations for residential and commercial system owners. We work with many of the leading solar and electrical
distributors. In addition to our distributors, we sell directly to large installers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”),
strategic partners and homeowners. Our OEM customers include solar module manufacturers who bundle our products
and solutions with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers. We also sell certain products
and services directly to the homeowners and the do-it-yourself market through our legacy product upgrade program or our
online store. Strategic partners include a variety of companies including industrial equipment suppliers and providers of
solar financing solutions. In 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 29% of total net revenues. The revenues
generated from the U.S. market have represented 82%, 84% and 69% of our total revenue for annual period ending on
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Manufacturing, Quality Control and Key Suppliers
We outsource the manufacturing of our products to manufacturing partners. Flex Ltd. and affiliates (“Flex”) and
Salcomp Manufacturing India Pvt. Ltd. (“Salcomp”) assemble and test our microinverter, AC Battery storage systems and
Envoy products. Prices for such services are agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis, and we are obligated to
purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the agreement. Flex also
provides receiving, kitting, storage, transportation, inventory visibility and other value-added logistics services at locations
managed by Flex. Hong Kong Sinbon Industrial Limited manufactures our custom AC cables. During the fourth quarter of
2020, we qualified Amperex Technology Limited (“ATL”) in addition to A123 Systems LLC (“A123”) as our lithium-ion
batteries suppliers to help increase our available capacity. In addition, we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply
certain components used in the fabrication of our products.
Our partnership with Flex and Salcomp provides us with strategic manufacturing capabilities and flexibility. In the
beginning of the second quarter of 2019, we announced the first shipment of seventh-generation Enphase IQ
microinverters produced in Mexico as part of our expanded manufacturing agreement with Flex. In addition, we began
microinverter production at Salcomp in India and started shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. We anticipate
that this additional manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India could help us to not only mitigate tariffs, but also better
serve our customers by cutting down delivery times and diversifying our supply chain.
Customer Service
We continue to cultivate an organizational focus on customer satisfaction and are committed to providing a best-in-
class customer experience. We maintain high levels of customer engagement through our customer support group and the
Enlighten cloud-based software portal. During 2020, we introduced the Enphase Community to help installers and
homeowners solve their problems quickly. We launched Service-on-the-Go™ in Australia, which installers can use from
their mobile devices to get service instantly. Our Net Promoter Score (commonly referred to as “NPS”) improved from 52%
in 2019 to 65% in 2020 through multiple customer service initiatives. In 2020, the service organization achieved average
wait time of under 3 minutes.TM

and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. A majority of our patents relate to DC to AC
power conversion and energy storage for alternative energy power systems, as well as power system monitoring, control
and management systems.
With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce,
we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many
elements of our microinverter and storage manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that
are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and
procedures.
We own or have rights to various registered trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries,
including Enphase, Ensemble, Encharge Envoy, Enpower and Enlighten, and rely on both registration of our marks as well
as common law protection where available.
All of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information
agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to
assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us.
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any
sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.

As part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property, we may take legal actions to prevent third parties
from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology.
Seasonality
Historically, the majority of our revenues are from the North American and European regions which experience higher
sales of our products in the second, third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand
trends, including weather patterns and construction cycles. The first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in
our industry, due to these same factors. Although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector, historical patterns
should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
Government Regulations
Our business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and
regulations. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws,
regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or
unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time
impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Changes in tax
policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on
imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws,
rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures and results of
operations.
Privacy and Security Laws
There are also data privacy and security laws to which we are currently, and/or may in the future, be subject. The
U.S., federal government, individual U.S. states, EU member countries and other jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have
adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and
use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(“GDPR”).
The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the control over personal data
by individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must
maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors
in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out
of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including
the potential for significant fines. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of
information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. The GDPR has increased our responsibility
and potential liability in relation to all types of personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may be
required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s
attention and increase our cost of doing business. However, despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into
compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control or other factors
outside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the GDPR,
leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU member states.

Additionally, in June 2018, the state of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”),
which contains requirements similar to GDPR for the handling of personal information of California residents, which
became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an
expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a
framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to
provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers
new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. It
remains unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and
exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related
to personal data. As we expand our operations, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some
observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the
United States. Additionally, other states are beginning to pass similar laws.
Government Incentives
U.S. federal, state, and local government bodies, as well as non-U.S. government bodies provide incentives to
owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of
rebates, tax credits, lower VAT rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for
renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from
property tax assessments. The market for on‑grid applications, where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s
electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, often depends in large part on the availability
and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives, which vary by geographic market and from time to time,
thus helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.
Our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted by the scheduled phase-
down of the investment tax credit for solar projects under Section 48(a) (the “ITC”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”). The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008 provided a 30% federal tax credit for
residential and commercial solar installations through December 31, 2019, which was reduced to a tax credit of 26% for
any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through December 31, 2022, and 22% thereafter to
December 31, 2023 before being reduced to 10% for commercial installations and 0% for residential installations beginning
on January 1, 2024. As a result, several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take
advantage of safe harbor guidance from the IRS published in June 2018, allowing them to preserve the historical 30%
investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after December 31, 2019.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not
presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations.
Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of
these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other
information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related
notes. See also “Forward-Looking Statements” in the forepart of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Risks Related to our Business, Operations and Our Industry
If demand for solar energy solutions does not grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate, including as a
result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our business will suffer.
Our microinverter and AC Battery storage systems are utilized in solar PV installations, which provide on-site
distributed power generation. As a result, our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and
the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand. The solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced
substantial changes in recent years, and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar PV systems
as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business. Traditional electricity distribution is
based on the regulated industry model under which businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government
regulated utility. For alternative methods of distributed power to succeed, businesses and consumers must adopt new
purchasing practices. The viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions, and in turn, our products,
may be impacted by many factors outside of our control, including:th
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 15
Table of Contents
•market acceptance of solar PV systems based on our product platform;
•cost competitiveness, reliability and performance of solar PV systems compared to conventional and non-solar
renewable energy sources and products;
•availability and amount of government subsidies and incentives to support the development and deployment of
solar energy solutions;
•the extent to which the electric power industry and broader energy industries are deregulated to permit broader
adoption of solar electricity generation;
•the cost and availability of key raw materials and components used in the production of solar PV systems;
•prices of traditional utility-provided energy sources;
•levels of investment by end-users of solar energy products, which tend to decrease when economic growth slows;
and
•the emergence, continuance or success of, or increased government support for, other alternative energy
generation technologies and products.
If demand for solar energy solutions does not grow, demand for our customers’ products as well as demand for our
products will decrease, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business.
Short-term demand and supply imbalances, especially for solar module technology, have recently caused prices for
solar technology solutions to decline rapidly. Furthermore, competition in the solar industry has increased due to the
emergence of lower-cost manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines, excess inventory
and oversupply. These market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices, which could
adversely affect our business and financial results.
Further, our success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment
vendors to meet this demand. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for solar energy solutions
decreased in the second and third quarters of 2020 compared to the same quarters of the prior year. The demand for solar
energy solutions may continue to decrease, or at least not continue its growth relative to pre-pandemic periods and recent
years, as a result of government orders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, due to adverse worldwide economic and
market conditions, or other factors. If demand for solar energy solutions decreases or does not grow, demand for our
customers’ products as well as demand for our products will decrease, which would have an adverse impact on our ability
to increase our revenue and grow our business.
The rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.
The solar energy industry is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy and is undergoing and subject to
rapid change. The solar energy industry will take several more years to develop and further mature, which makes it difficult
to evaluate our current business, and we cannot be certain that the market will grow to the size or at the rate we expect.
We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in
rapidly changing industries, including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business. If we do not manage these
risks and overcome these difficulties successfully, our business will suffer.
Since we began commercial shipments of our products, our revenue, gross profit and results of operations have
varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our
control. It is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and,
therefore, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations.

We depend on sole-source and limited-source suppliers for key components and products. If we are unable to
source these components and products on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver our products to our
customers.
We depend on sole-source and limited-source suppliers for key components of our products, such as our ASICs and
lithium-ion batteries. Any of the sole-source and limited-source suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and
reliability issues, stop producing our components, cease operations, or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive
arrangements with, our competitors. We generally do not have long-term supply agreements with our suppliers, and our
purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers. As a
result, most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices, or at all. Any such quality or
reliability issue, or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources,
which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Switching suppliers may require that we redesign
our products to accommodate new components, and may potentially require us to re-qualify our products, which would be
costly and time-consuming. Any interruption in the quality or supply of sole-source or limited-source components for our
products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost
revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business.
Our business has been affected by, is currently being adversely affected and could be materially and adversely
affected in the future by the current impacts and evolving effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-
19 pandemic may continue to, and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health
crises may in the future, adversely affect our and our customers’ results of operations and financial condition, our
supply chain and our business.
Our business has been affected by, is currently being adversely affected and could be materially and adversely
affected in the future by the evolving effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also
continues to have worldwide impact resulting in a global slowdown of economic activity which has decreased demand for a
broad variety of goods and services, including from our customers, while also disrupting sales channels and marketing
activities. As a result, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our sales and our results of
operations. We are closely evaluating the impacts of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability, and the
ability of our third-party partners to effectively market, maintain supply, sell and distribute our products. Further, even
though vaccine programs have recently been initiated, there is no current indication whether these vaccine programs will
be effective. We are currently unable to predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue, whether vaccinations or
other actions will contain the pandemic, and the extent and duration of the pandemic’s continued impact on our current or
future performance.
Among other impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental orders, including the various “shelter-
in-place” orders, slowed the demand for our products, and we expect the pandemic will continue to reduce demand for our
products and impede or cause temporary and long-term disruptions in solar installations, our supply chains and/or delays in
the delivery of our products. The most significant near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our financial performance have been
a decline in sales orders as future residential and commercial system owners are canceling sales meetings with system
installation professionals or postponing system installations. As the purchase of new solar energy management solutions
declines as part of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer spending, many businesses through which we
distribute our products are working at limited operational capacity.
Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental orders could require or cause employees to
continue to “shelter-in-place” for longer periods of time, which could adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and
manage our businesses. While our field-based personnel are engaging in limited in-person interactions, they are primarily
using electronic communication, such as emails, phone calls and video conferences. We expect the different quality of
electronic interactions as compared with in-person interactions, as well as the reduced quantity of interactions during the
COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce the effectiveness of our sales personnel, as well as those of our partners, which have and
could negatively affect our sales and future revenue. Further, such risks could also adversely affect our customers' financial
condition, resulting in reduced spending for our solar products.
The global spread of COVID-19 and the efforts to control it have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely
affect, global supply chains. Any disruptions to our suppliers and manufacturers by, for example, worker absenteeism,
quarantines, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, or other travel or health-
related restrictions have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business and operations.
For example, the general market for the semiconductors has been disrupted by the
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 17
Table of Contents
COVID-19 pandemic, and that disruption has impacted and may in future further impact the component supply for our IQ7
and IQ8 products. As a result of these supply chain disruptions, we are working to expand our supplier base, but there can
be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that supply chain disruptions will not continue, or worsen. Limits on
manufacturing availability or capacity, or delays in production or delivery of components, due to COVID-19-related
restrictions could delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished products and offerings,
which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships.
Our liquidity also may be negatively impacted if sales decline significantly for an extended period due to the impact of
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary
measures in response thereto impact our business and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are uncertain
and cannot be precisely predicted at this time.
The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of
operations will depend on future developments, including those that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with
confidence at this time, including the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing
and business closure requirements in the U.S. and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to
contain and treat the disease. It is possible that additional legislation or governmental action will be taken in response to
the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of
changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation or governmental action;
however, such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could negatively affect our revenue or sales of our current and or
potential future products. Moreover, the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unknown, and it is possible
that following the pandemic in-person interactions will remain limited, which would negatively impact our sales team and
our future revenues. These and other potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed elsewhere in this “Risk
Factors” section, as well as any future and unforeseen risks related to the pandemic not yet contemplated, could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent the evolving effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, they may also have the
effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section.
It is also possible that future global pandemics could also occur and also materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
We depend upon a sole-source and small number of outside contract manufacturers, and our business and
operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers.
We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build
our products. In particular, we outsource the manufacturing of our products to manufacturing partners. Flex Ltd. and
affiliates (“Flex”), and Salcomp Manufacturing India Pvt. Ltd. (“Salcomp”) assemble and test our microinverter, AC Battery
storage systems and Envoy products. Prices for such services are agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis, and we are
obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the related
agreements. As of December 31, 2020 our related purchase obligations (including amounts related to component inventory
procured by our primary contract manufacturers on our behalf) were approximately $162.2 million. The timing of purchases
in future periods could differ materially from our estimates due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying
sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.
Flex also provides receiving, kitting, storage, transportation, inventory visibility and other value-added logistics
services at locations managed by Flex. Hong Kong Sinbon Industrial Limited manufactures our custom AC cables. During
the fourth quarter of 2020, we qualified Amperex Technology Limited in addition to A123 Systems LLC as our lithium-ion
batteries suppliers to help increase our available capacity. In addition, we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply
certain components used in the fabrication of our products.
Our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and
reduced control over component availability, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. We do not have long-term
supply contracts with our contract manufacturing partners. Consequently, these manufacturers are not obligated to supply
products to us for any period, in any specified quantity or at any certain price. If any of these suppliers reduce or eliminate
the supply of the components to us in the future, our revenues, business, financial condition and results of operations
would be adversely impacted.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 18
Table of Contents
Further, the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small
percentage of their overall revenues. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of
constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner. In addition, the facilities in which the vast
majority of our products are manufactured are located outside of the U.S. We believe that the location of these facilities
outside of the U.S. increases supply risk, including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or
controls.
If any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at
high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements, we would have to identify, qualify and select
acceptable alternative contract manufacturers, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. For example,
we have experienced a volume shortage of components and may experience in future as well. An alternative contract
manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production
requirements on commercially reasonable terms. Any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce
our supply of products to our customers, which in turn would reduce our revenues, harm our relationships with our
customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities.
If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw
materials increases significantly, production time and product costs could increase, which may adversely affect
our business.
The manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as
copper, aluminum, silicon and petroleum-based products. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies
or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us
directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials. If the prices of these raw
materials rise significantly, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers. While we may from time to
time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, the availability
and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited. Due to all these factors, our results of operations could be
adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely
manner or at reasonable cost. In addition, from time to time, we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw
materials that do not meet our specifications, resulting in potential delays or declines in output. Furthermore, problems with
our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, which could lead to an increase in
product warranty claims. Errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our
detection or control, which could lead to additional product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and
results of operations.
Manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments, which would adversely affect our revenue,
competitive position and reputation.
We have in the past and may in the future experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our
manufacturing operations. Our product development, manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require
significant technological and production process expertise. Such processes involve a number of precise steps from design
to production. Any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors, requiring a temporary suspension
or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched, identified and properly addressed and rectified. This may
occur particularly as we introduce new products, modify our engineering and production techniques, and expand our
capacity. In addition, our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product
failures, loss of customers, increased production costs and delays. Any of these developments could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
A disruption could also occur in one of our contract manufacturers’ facilities due to any number of reasons, such as
equipment failure, contaminated materials, COVID-19 pandemic impacts or process deviations, which could adversely
impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments. As a result, we could incur additional costs that would adversely
affect our gross profit, and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the schedules requested, which
would negatively affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 19
Table of Contents
Additionally, manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the stability and manufacturability of the
product design, manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes, and the quality and consistency
of component parts. Capacity constraints, raw materials shortages, logistics issues, labor shortages, and changes in
customer requirements, manufacturing facilities or processes have historically caused, and may in the future cause,
reduced manufacturing yields, negatively impacting the gross profit on, and our production capacity for, those products.
Moreover, an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before, during or after
manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields, gross profit and production capacity.
Component shortages have required us and may continue to require us to incur expedited shipping costs to meet
delivery schedules, which impacts our revenue and gross profit.
The risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines,
which has from time to time caused, and may in the future cause, temporary suspension of product lines while problems
are addressed or corrected. Since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines, any
prolonged or substantial suspension of an individual product line could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue,
gross profit, competitive position, and distributor and customer relationships.
We rely primarily on distributors, installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products to
customers, and the failure of these customers to perform at the expected level, or at all, would have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.
We sell our solutions primarily through distributors, as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and
developers of third-party solar finance offerings. We do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties. As a
result, many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors, which may reduce our sales. Our
customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time, or with short notice. Our customers may fail to
devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices, in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect, or
may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors. In addition, participants in the solar industry are
becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process, which may lead to an
overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products.
In addition, while we provide our distributors and installers with training and other programs, including accreditations
and certifications, these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently. In addition, new partners may require
extensive training and may take significant time and resources to achieve productivity. Our partners may subject us to
lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our
platform or products to customers, fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations, or violate laws or our policies. In
addition, our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with
products and services that we offer currently or in the future. Concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property
ownership could constrain the growth and development of these partnerships or result in the termination of one or more
partnerships. If we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners, or properly monitor the quality and efficacy
of their service delivery, our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted, and our
operating results may be harmed.
Our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers, as
well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets
in which we have not previously distributed our products. Termination of agreements with current customers, failure by
customers to perform as expected, or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships, could hinder our ability to
expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results.
The solar industry is highly competitive, and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing
competitors introduce products or develop alternative technologies, which could negatively impact our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
We compete primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers, as well as against new solutions and
emerging technologies that directly compete with our business. A number of companies have developed or are developing
microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our solutions in the module-level power electronics market.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 20
Table of Contents
Competitors in the inverter market include, among others, SolarEdge Technologies, Inc., Fronius International GmbH,
SMA Solar Technology AG, AP Systems, Generac, Tesla, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Delta, Ginglong, Sungrow,
Solax and other companies offering string inverters. Other existing or emerging companies may also begin offering
alternative microinverter, DC-to-DC optimizer, energy storage, monitoring and other solutions that compete with our
products. Competitors in the storage market include Tesla, LG Chem, Sonnen, Generac, Panasonic, BYD, E3/DC, Senec,
Schneider, Goal Zero, Simpliphi and other producers of battery cells and integrated storage systems.
Several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial,
marketing, distribution, and customer support resources, and may have significantly broader brand recognition, especially
in certain markets. In addition, some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring
new products and technologies and creating market awareness for these offerings. Further, certain competitors may be
able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that
provide more functionality than ours. In addition, some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive
products at aggressive or below-market pricing levels, which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to
lower prices of our products in order to compete effectively. Suppliers of solar products, particularly solar modules, have
experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining
revenues. If we have to reduce our prices, or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices
by increasing our sales volume, reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products, our revenues and gross
profit would suffer.
Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advances in other forms of distributed solar PV power
generation, storage solutions such as batteries, the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial
properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our
business and prospects. Any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in
existing technologies, could result in product obsolescence, the loss of competitiveness of our products, decreased
revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.
We also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities
against the merits of manufacturing products internally. Other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire
competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform DC-to-AC conversion in the module
itself. Due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products,
they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers. As a
result, these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our systems or sell products that compete with our
systems, which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit.
The loss of, or events affecting, one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 29% of total net revenues.
Further, as of December 31, 2020, amounts due from one customer represented approximately 36% of the total accounts
receivable balance, and amounts due from three customers represented 34%, 14% and 11% of the total accounts
receivable balance as of December 31, 2019. Our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a
number of factors outside of our control, including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives, among
others. Although we have agreements with some of our largest customers, these agreements generally do not have long-
term purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period. In addition,
these customers may decide to no longer use, or to reduce the use of, our products and services for other reasons that
may be out of our control. We may also be affected by events impacting our large customers that result in their decreasing
their orders with us or impairing their ability to pay for our products. The loss of, or events affecting, one or more of our
large customers have had from time to time, and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our microinverter systems, including our storage solution, integrated AC Module, eighth-generation IQ
microinverters and Ensemble technology, may not achieve broader market acceptance, which would prevent us
from increasing our revenue and market share.
If we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products, including international acceptance of our eighth-
generation IQ microinverters and Ensemble technology announced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and for which product
shipments commenced during the second quarter of 2020, there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our
revenue, gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability. Our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our
products will be impacted by a number of factors, including:
•our ability to produce PV systems that compete favorably against other solutions on the basis of price, quality,
reliability and performance;
•our ability to timely introduce and complete new designs and timely qualify and certify our products;
•whether installers, system owners and solar financing providers will continue to adopt our systems, which have a
relatively limited history with respect to reliability and performance;
•whether installers, system owners and solar financing providers will adopt our storage solution, which is a
relatively new technology with a limited history with respect to reliability and performance;
•the ability of prospective system owners to obtain long-term financing for solar PV installations based on our
product platform on acceptable terms or at all;
•our ability to develop products that comply with local standards and regulatory requirements, as well as potential
in-country manufacturing requirements; and
•our ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with our customers and suppliers.
In addition, our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established
solar installers, who have traditionally sold central or string inverters, or who currently sell DC-to-DC optimizers. These
installers often have made substantial investments in design, installation resources and training in traditional central or
string inverter systems or DC optimizers, which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our solutions.
Our success in marketing and selling “AC module” versions of our microinverter system depends in part upon our
ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers.
We continue to work on variants of our microinverter systems that enable direct attachment of a microinverter to solar
modules. The market success of such “AC Module” solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely
with SunPower and other solar module manufacturers to design microinverters that are compatible with and can be
attached directly to solar modules. We may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the
development of such compatible solutions for a variety of reasons, including differences in marketing or selling strategy,
competitive considerations, lack of competitive pricing, and technological compatibility. In addition, our ability to form
effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial challenges faced by
many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules and the tariffs in the U.S.
Our recent and planned expansion into existing and new markets could subject us to additional business,
financial and competitive risks.
We currently offer solar microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets throughout the world,
and we intend to expand into other international markets. Our success in new geographic and product markets will depend
on a number of factors, such as:
•acceptance of microinverters in markets in which they have not traditionally been used;
•our ability to compete in new product markets to which we are not accustomed;
•our ability to manage manufacturing capacity and production;
•willingness of our potential customers to incur a higher upfront capital investment than may be required for
competing solutions;
•timely qualification and certification of new products;
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 22
Table of Contents
•our ability to reduce production costs in order to price our products competitively;
•availability of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy solutions;
•accurate forecasting and effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand;
•our customer service capabilities and responsiveness; and
•timely hiring of the skilled employees and efficient execution of our project plan.
Further, new geographic markets and larger commercial and utility-scale installation markets have different
characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products, and our success will depend on our ability to properly
address these differences. These differences may include:
•differing regulatory requirements, including tax laws, trade laws, labor, safety, local content, recycling and
consumer protection regulations, tariffs, export quotas, customs duties or other trade restrictions;
•limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;
•risk of change in international political or economic conditions;
•restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;
•fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;
•difficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and trade
standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act;
•potentially longer sales cycles;
•generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;
•higher volume requirements;
•increased customer concentrations;
•warranty expectations and product return policies; and
•cost, performance and compatibility requirements.
Failure to address these new markets successfully, to generate sufficient revenue from these markets to offset
associated research and development, marketing and manufacturing costs, or to otherwise effectively anticipate and
manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets, could
adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.
We may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing.
We are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets. We
have made investments in our infrastructure, increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in
order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so. Any new product is subject to certain risks, including
component sourcing, strategic partner selection and execution, customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation,
market timing, challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified
personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point
where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new
product introductions, these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline
projected, thus, having a materially adverse impact on our revenue, operating results and financial stability.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced our eight-generation IQ microinverters and Ensemble technology. We
started production shipments of Ensemble technology to customers in North America during the second quarter of 2020.
Our new products are complex and require significant preparation, precautionary safety measures, time-consuming string
calculations, extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment, training and knowledge. Together, these
factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer. Our installers
may not have sufficient resources or expertise necessary to sell our products at the prices, in the volumes and within the
time frames that we expect, which could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating
results.

If we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to
achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.
Our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain
key personnel, and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key personnel in areas
such as engineering, marketing, and sales, any of whom would be difficult to replace. For example, we are highly
dependent on our president and chief executive officer, Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman. Mr. Kothandaraman possesses
technical knowledge of our business, operations and strategy, and he has substantial experience and contacts that help us
implement our goals, strategy and plan. If we lose his services or if he decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete
directly or indirectly with us, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.
All of our employees, including our senior management, are free to terminate their employment relationships with us
at any time. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense, and our
competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to
continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the
progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help
attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use stock-based incentive awards, including
restricted stock units. If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of
our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to
attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our business and results
of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create substantial
personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future
restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.
Additionally, our ability to attract qualified personnel, including senior management and key technical personnel, is
critical to the execution of our growth strategy. Competition for qualified senior management personnel and highly skilled
individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense, and we face challenges identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified
personnel in all areas of our business. In addition, integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our
operations, require substantial resources and management attention, and ultimately prove unsuccessful. Our failure to
attract and retain qualified senior management and other key technical personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

Any failure by management to properly manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, and financial condition.
Our business has grown rapidly, and if our business develops as currently expected, we anticipate that we will
continue to grow rapidly in the near future. Our expected rapid growth could place significant demands on our
management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources, and it may also negatively impact
our ability to retain key personnel. If we experience difficulties in any of these or other areas, we may not be able to expand
our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage our growth and to
respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
If we are unsuccessful in continuing to expand our direct-to-consumer sales channel by driving purchases
through our website, our business and results of operation could be harmed.
We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as federal, state, foreign and provincial regulations
and laws specifically governing the internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the
growth of the use of the internet, availability of economic broadband access, or other online services, and increase the cost
of providing our digital delivery of content and services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, tariffs, user
privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer
protection, broadband internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws
governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet
and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations.
Although we primarily sell our solutions and products directly to solar distributors, who resell to installers and
integrators, who then in turn integrate our products into complete solar PV installations for residential and commercial
system owners, we have recently invested significant resources in our direct-to-consumer sales channel through our
website, and our future growth relies, in part, on our ability to attract consumers through this channel. Expanding our direct-
to-consumer sales model will require significant expenditures in marketing, software development and infrastructure.
Further, the success of direct-to-consumer sales through our website is also subject to general business regulations and
laws, as well as federal, state, foreign and provincial regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e-
commerce. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, tariffs, privacy, data protection, pricing, distribution, electronic
contracts and other communications, consumer protection and intellectual property. These laws and regulations can be
complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering
with our ability to sell our products directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Further, the expansion of our direct-to-consumer channel could alienate some of our existing partners and cause a
reduction in sales from these partners. Our existing partners may perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage based on
the direct-to-consumer sales offered through our website. Due to these and other factors, conflicts in our sales channels
could arise and cause our existing partners to divert resources away from the promotion and sale of our products. If we are
unable to successfully continue to drive traffic to, and increase sales through, our website, our business and results of
operations could be harmed.

Risks Related to our Intellectual Property and Technology
We could be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could cause significant
reputational, legal and financial damages.
Like many companies, we use and store a wide variety of confidential and proprietary information relating to our
business. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite our implementation
of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks,
worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks,
unauthorized access, including impersonation of unauthorized users, efforts to discover and exploit any security
vulnerabilities or securities weaknesses, and other similar disruptions. These types of attacks have increased, in general,
as more businesses implement remote working environments. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security
and integrity of our information technology and related systems, and have implemented measures to manage the risk of a
security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective, or that
attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.
The techniques used in attempted cyber-attacks and intrusions are sophisticated and constantly evolving, and may
be difficult to detect for long periods of time. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate
preventative measures. Although to date we have not experienced any material breaches of our systems that could have
material adverse effect on our business, attacks and intrusions on our systems will continue and we may experience a
breach of our systems that compromises sensitive company information or customer data. In addition, hardware, software,
or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems
that could unexpectedly compromise information security. If we experience a significant data security breach, we could be
exposed to reputational damage and significant costs, including to rebuild our systems, modify our products and services,
defend litigation, respond to government enforcement actions, pay damages or take other remedial steps, any of which
could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to incur
significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.
We may also share information with contractors and third-party providers to conduct our business. Although such
contractors and third-party providers typically implement encryption and authentication technologies to secure the
transmission and storage of data, those third-party providers may experience a significant data security breach, which may
also detrimentally affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
The software we use in providing system configuration recommendations or potential energy savings estimates to
customers relies in part on third party information that may not be accurate or up-to-date; this may therefore
generate inaccurate recommendations or estimates, resulting in a loss of reputation and customer confidence.
We provide our customers online tools to help them determine proper system sizing and configurations, estimates of
bill savings, and potential revenues resulting from executing a specific curtailment strategy. These estimates are in turn
based on a number of factors such as customer tariff structures, estimated wholesale electricity prices and estimates of the
reduction in electricity usage as a result of a curtailment activity. If the estimates we provide prove to be significantly
different from actual payments or savings received by our customers, it may result in the loss of reputation and/or customer
confidence.

We are subject to stringent privacy laws, information security policies and contractual obligations governing the
use, processing and transfer of personal information and any unauthorized access to, or disclosure or theft of
personal information we gather, store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation.
We receive, store and use certain personal information of our customers, and the end-users of our customers’ solar
PV systems, including names, addresses, e-mail addresses, credit information and energy production statistics. We also
store and use personal information of our employees. We take steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of
the personal information we collect, store and transmit, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or
disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts.
Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not
identified until they are launched against a target, we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these
techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures.
We are subject to a variety of local, state, national and international laws, directives and regulations that apply to the
collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data in the different jurisdictions
in which we operate, including comprehensive regulatory systems in the U.S. and Europe. California enacted the California
Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA), which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy
and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and
became enforceable by the California Attorney General on July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended from time to time,
and, further a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters in the
November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by
expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state
agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. It remains unclear what, if any,
further modifications will be made to the CCPA or CPRA, or how such legislation will be interpreted. Certain other state
laws impose similar privacy obligations and all 50 states have laws including obligations to provide notification of security
breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, state officers and others.
In May 25, 2018, the European Union (“EU”), implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), a
broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current EU data protection law to non-European Union entities
that process, or control the processing of, the personal information of EU subjects.
The GDPR imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example,
more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach
notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of data, such
as health data, and additional obligations when we contract with third-party processors in connection with the processing of
the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU and the EEA to the
United States and other third countries. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that
struck down the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which provided companies with a mechanism to comply with data
protection requirements when transferring personal data from the EU to the United States and additionally called into
question the validity of the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, on which U.S. companies rely to
transfer personal data from Europe to the United States and elsewhere. If we or our vendors fail to comply with the GDPR
and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU or EEA member states, or if regulators assert we have failed to
comply with these laws, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to
€20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and
other administrative penalties. Further, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU and the EEA, and the expiry
of the transition period, companies have to comply with both the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into the United
Kingdom national law, the Data Protection Act of 2018, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the
greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to
certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between
each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk.
Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs
or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Our and
our collaborators’ and contractors’ failure to fully comply with GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and
other laws could lead to significant fines and require onerous corrective action. In addition,
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27
Table of Contents
data security breaches experienced by us, our collaborators or contractors could result in the loss of trade secrets or other
intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive commercial data, and the exposure of personally identifiable information
(including sensitive personal information) of our employees, customers, collaborators and others. Compliance with these
and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we
may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.
Furthermore, the laws are not consistent, and compliance with various different requirements may be costly. If we fail to
comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf, whether
through breach of our systems, breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party, or through
employee or contractor error, theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use or
disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted, and we
could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and investigations, related actions, and penalties by
regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise
complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to,
or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure
of, such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights,
our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.
Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary
rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as
confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property
and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the U.S. and in other countries,
some of which have been issued. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our
existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology, and any failure
to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to, among
other things, rebrand or re-design our affected products. In countries where we have not applied for patent protection or
where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the U.S., we may be at greater risk
that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated, infringed or otherwise violated.
To protect our unregistered intellectual property, including our trade secrets and know-how, we rely in part on trade
secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors. We
also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into non-
disclosure agreements. Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and we cannot assure that our
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information,
especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us, or provide us with an
adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure. Furthermore, competitors or other third parties may independently
discover our trade secrets, copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof, or develop similar technology. If we
fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be
materially harmed.
In the future, we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our
intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property
rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and
attention from our technical and management personnel, which could significantly harm our business. In addition, we may
not prevail in such proceedings. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or
otherwise harm our financial condition and our business.

We may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that
could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network
infrastructures to operate our business. In addition, our Enlighten web-based monitoring service, which our installers and
end-user customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar PV systems, is dependent on cloud-based
hosting services, along with the availability of WiFi or mobile data services at end-user premises. Despite testing by us, real
or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our customer solutions, software or technology or the technology or software we
license from third parties, including open source software, may not be found until our customers use our products. Real or
perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of
our products, harm to our brand, weakening of our competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by
them. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems, third-party cloud hosting platforms or end-
user data services as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer
viruses, cyber-attacks, third-party security breaches, employee/human error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power
disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, failure of our Enlighten service, loss of
intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner,
customer and employee personal data. We have been and may in the future be subject to fraud attempts from outside
parties through our electronic systems (such as “phishing” e-mail communications to our finance, technical or other
personnel), which could put us at risk for harm from fraud, theft or other loss if our internal controls do not operate as
intended. Any such future events could further harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, cause
us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial
condition.
Third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, which could divert
management’s attention, cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology
to which such rights relate.
Our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry, and claims
of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against our competitors. We may
also be subject to such claims and litigation. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming,
divert management’s attention and resources, and may cause us to incur significant expenses. While we believe that our
products and technology do not infringe upon any intellectual property rights of third parties, we cannot be certain that we
would be successful in defending against any such claims. Furthermore, patent applications in the U.S. and most other
countries are confidential for a period of time before being published, so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing
third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent
applications. An adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and
force us to do one or more of the following:
•obtain from a third-party claiming infringement a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which may not be
available on reasonable terms, or at all;
•stop manufacturing, selling, incorporating or using products that embody the asserted intellectual property;
•pay substantial monetary damages;
•indemnify our customers under some of our customer contracts; or
•expend significant resources to redesign the products that use the infringing technology, or to develop or acquire
non-infringing technology.
Any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an
extended period of time.

Our failure to obtain the right to use necessary third-party intellectual property rights on reasonable terms, or our
failure to maintain, and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights, could harm our business
and prospects.
We have licensed, and in the future we may choose or be required to license, technology or intellectual property from
third parties in connection with the development and marketing of our products. We cannot assure you that such licenses
will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us
to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost.
Further, such licenses may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same
intellectual property. The licensing or acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and other
established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may
consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their
size, capital resources or greater development or commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to
be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We could encounter delays and incur significant costs, in
product or service introductions while we attempt to develop alternative products or services, or redesign our products or
services, to avoid infringing third party patents or proprietary rights. Failure to obtain any such licenses or to develop a
workaround could prevent us from commercializing products or services, and the prohibition of sale or the threat of the
prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could materially affect our business and our ability to gain market
acceptance for our products or services.
In addition, we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software. Use of open source software can
lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, since open source licensors generally do not provide
warranties or controls with respect to origin, functionality or other features of the software. Further, companies that
incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging their use of open
source software and compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties
claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing
terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to
publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code
available for limited fees or at no cost. Although we monitor our use of open source software, open source license terms
may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated. If we
were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code,
re-engineer our software, discontinue the sale of certain products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a
timely basis, or take other remedial action. Furthermore, if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or
fail to comply with open source licenses, we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement
or ownership of our proprietary source code. There is little legal precedent in this area and any actual or claimed
requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could harm our business and
could help third parties, including our competitors, develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours. Any
of the above could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage.
We may not be able to protect and enforce our trademarks and trade names, or build name recognition in our
markets of interest thereby harming our competitive position.
The registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names that we own may be challenged, infringed, circumvented,
declared generic, lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our
rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition. In addition, third parties
have filed, and may in the future file, for registration of trademarks similar or identical to our trademarks, thereby impeding
our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. If they succeed in registering or developing
common law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such rights, we may not be able to use
these trademarks to develop brand recognition of our technologies, products or services. In addition, there could be
potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that
incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. If third parties succeed they succeed in
registering such trademarks in the U.S. or other countries, and if we are not successful in challenging such third party
rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products and technologies such countries. If we do not
secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we
otherwise would. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be
able to
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 30
Table of Contents
compete effectively, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. And, over the
long-term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks, then our marketing abilities may be
materially adversely impacted.
Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various required procedures,
document submissions, fee payments and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our
patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.
Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or
applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States at
several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these
fees, and we engage an outside service and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent
agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of
procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ
reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by
payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which
non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss
of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors may be able to enter the market without
infringing our patents and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of
time.
Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of
a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the
life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our products are obtained, once the patent
life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. If one of our products requires extended
development, testing and/or regulatory review, patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such
products are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights
to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.
Risks related to Legal Proceedings and Regulations
Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations, or new interpretations
thereof, in the solar energy sector or international trade, by federal or state agencies in the United States or
foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to compete, and could materially harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
There has been and will continue to be regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector generally and the solar
energy sector in particular. Changes in current laws or regulations, or the imposition of new laws and regulations around
the world, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
changes in our products or further changes in tariffs, export and import laws and implementing regulations may create
delays in the introduction of new products in international markets, prevent our customers from deploying our products
internationally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether.
For example, several states or territories, including California, Hawaii and Queensland, Australia, have either
implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar
power systems with which we may not be able to comply. In the event that we cannot comply with these or other new
regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise, the total market available for our microinverter
products in such states, and our business as a result, may be adversely impacted.
While we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict
our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale, any change in export or import regulations
or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries,
persons or technologies targeted by these regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our
decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. In such
event, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 31
Table of Contents
Additionally, if the U.S. takes action to eliminate or reduce laws, regulations and incentives supporting solar energy,
such actions may result in a decrease in demand for solar energy in the U.S. and other geographical markets, it would
harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in the U.S. trade environment, including the recent imposition of import tariffs, could adversely affect the
amount or timing of our revenues, results of operations or cash flows.
Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including
tariffs applicable to certain of our products. For example, on September 24, 2018, the U.S. began assessing 10% tariffs on
certain solar products manufactured in China including our microinverter products and related accessories which are
manufactured in China. These tariffs increased to 25% in May 2019, and on January 15, 2020, the United States and China
entered into an initial trade deal which preserves the bulk of the tariffs imposed in 2018 and maintains a threat of additional
sanctions should China breach the terms of the deal.
However, on March 26, 2020, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced certain exclusion requests
related to tariffs on Chinese imported microinverter products that fit the dimensions and weight limits within a Section 301
Tariff exclusion (the “Tariff Exclusion”). The Tariff Exclusion applied to covered products exported from China to the United
States from September 24, 2018 until August 7, 2020. Accordingly, we sought refunds totaling approximately $38.9 million
plus approximately $0.6 million accrued interest on tariffs previously paid from September 24, 2018 to March 31, 2020 for
certain microinverters that qualify for the Tariff Exclusion. As of December 31, 2020, we have received $24.8 million of tariff
refunds and accrued for the remaining $14.7 million tariff refunds that were approved, however, not yet received on or
before December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $38.9 million as a reduction to cost of
revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the approved refunds relate to paid tariffs previously recorded to
cost of revenues. Therefore, we recorded the corresponding approved tariff refunds as credits to cost of revenues in the
current period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded the $0.6 million accrued interest as interest income in
our consolidated statement of operations. The tariff refund receivable of $14.7 million is recorded as a reduction of
accounts payable to Flex Ltd. and affiliates, our manufacturing partner and the importer of record who will first receive the
tariff refunds, on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. This exemption has expired in August 2020,
and our request to extend it has been denied. Unless U.S. policy changes, or we are eligible for other exemptions or take
other actions to avoid them, such tariffs will continue to apply to our microinverters and other products. Such tariffs could
hurt the demand for these products and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. There is
no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining exemptions or that any actions that we may pursue with respect to the
organization and operation of our business will effectively mitigate the effects of any tariffs that apply to our business. If we
are not able to avoid or mitigate the effects of such tariffs, the tariffs (or mitigating actions we might take) could result in
material additional costs to us and our suppliers, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted as a result.
It is unknown whether and to what extent additional new tariffs or other new laws or regulations will be adopted that
increase the cost of manufacturing in China and/or importing components from China to the United States. Further, it is
unknown what effect that any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions would have on us or our industry and customers. Our
LFP lithium-ion phosphate battery cells for our storage products are supplied solely via our two suppliers in China. Although
we are in the process of searching for other suppliers outside of China for future supplies, the expertise and industry for the
LFP lithium-ion phosphate battery cell is primarily in China and we cannot be certain that we will locate additional qualified
suppliers with the right expertise to develop our battery cells outside of China, if at all.
In response to the tensions in US-China trade relations and increased tariffs, we focused efforts and resources on
attaining manufacturers outside of China, primarily in Mexico and India. The tariffs and the possibility of additional tariffs in
the future have created uncertainty in the industry. If the price of solar power systems in the United States increases, the
use of solar power systems could become less economically feasible and could reduce our gross margins or reduce the
demand of solar power systems manufactured and sold, which in turn may decrease demand for our products. Additionally,
existing or future tariffs may negatively affect key partners, suppliers, and manufacturers. Such outcomes could adversely
affect the amount or timing of our revenues, results of operations or cash flows, and continuing uncertainty could cause
sales volatility, price fluctuations or supply shortages or cause our customers to advance or delay their purchase of our
products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include additional or
increased tariffs and trade restrictions, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions. As additional
new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if China or
other
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 32
Table of Contents
affected countries take retaliatory trade actions, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Our significant international operations subject us to additional risks that could adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
We have significant international operations, including in emerging markets such as India, and we are continuing to
expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 41% of our
total employees were located in India, where we primarily conduct our research and development activities, procurement,
customer support services, and other general and administrative support functions. Our current international operations
and our plans to expand our international operations have placed, and will continue to place, a strain on our employees,
management systems and other resources.
Our international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in operating businesses internationally, such
as:
•our lack of familiarity with commercial and social norms and customs in countries which may adversely affect our
ability to recruit, retain and manage employees in these countries;
•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;
•the potential diversion of management’s attention to oversee and direct operations that are geographically distant
from our U.S. headquarters;
•compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment,
tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;
•legal systems in which our ability to enforce and protect our rights may be different or less effective than in the
United States and in which the ultimate result of dispute resolution is more difficult to predict;
•higher employee costs and difficulty in terminating non-performing employees;
•differences in workplace cultures;
•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
•tariffs, export controls and other non-tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules;
•more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•adverse tax consequences, including as a result of transfer pricing adjustments involving our foreign operations;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•anti-bribery compliance by us or our partners;
•restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•global epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases; and
•new and different sources of competition.
Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our existing and future international operations and
seriously impair our overall business.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 33
Table of Contents
We could be adversely affected by any violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery
laws.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making
improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Other countries in
which we operate also have anti-bribery laws, some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non-
government persons and entities, and others (e.g., the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act) extend their application to activities
outside of their country of origin. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. We currently
operate in, and may further expand into, key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some
degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.
In addition, due to the level of regulation in our industry, our entry into new jurisdictions through internal growth or
acquisitions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from U.S. standards. Although, we implement
policies and procedures and conduct training designed to facilitate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, thereby
mitigating the risk of violations of such laws, our employees, subcontractors, agents and partners may take actions in
violation of our policies and anti-bribery laws. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could subject us to
criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, cash flows, and reputation.
From time to time we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of
such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes could adversely affect our
business and financial condition.
We are, or may become, involved in legal proceedings, government and agency investigations, and consumer,
employment, tort and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings (see
discussion of “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The outcome of some of these
legal proceeding could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or
could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.
There can also be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities.
Additionally, defending against lawsuits and legal proceedings may involve significant expense and could divert the
attention of our key personnel.
Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Liquidity
The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar
electricity applications could reduce demand for solar PV systems and harm our business.
The market for on-grid applications, where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from
the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, depends in large part on the availability and size of government and
economic incentives that vary by geographic market. Because our customers’ sales are typically into the on-grid market,
the reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar electricity may
negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and non-solar renewable sources of
electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business.
In general, the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates, and we believe this tendency will continue
in the near term. As a result, national, state and local government bodies in many countries, including the U.S., have
provided incentives in the form of feed-in tariffs (“FiTs”), rebates, tax credits and other incentives to system owners,
distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar PV systems to promote the use of solar electricity in on-grid
applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Many of these government incentives expire, phase out
over time, terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding, require renewal by the applicable authority or are being
changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national, state or local energy policy.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 34
Table of Contents
Electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other non-solar renewable sources of electricity may
successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry. Reductions
in, or eliminations or expirations of, governmental incentives in regions where we focus our sales efforts could result in
decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar PV systems there, which would adversely affect sales of our products.
In addition, our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and
maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity, to the extent such incentives are not currently in place. Furthermore,
electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our
sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry.
Our gross profit may fluctuate over time, which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.
Our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period. Our gross
profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•changes in customer, geographic or product mix;
•increased price competition, including the impact of customer and competitor discounts and rebates;
•our ability to reduce and control product costs, including our ability to make product cost reductions in a timely
manner to offset declines in our product prices;
•warranty costs and reserves, including changes resulting from changes in estimates related to the long-term
performance of our products, product replacement costs and warranty claim rates, as well as changes in the
discount rates;
•loss of cost savings due to changes in component or raw material pricing or charges incurred due to inventory
holding periods if product demand is not correctly anticipated;
•introduction of new products;
•ordering patterns from our distributors;
•price reductions on older products to sell remaining inventory;
•component shortages and related expedited shipping costs;
•our ability to reduce production costs, such as through technology innovations, in order to offset price declines in
our products over time;
•changes in shipment volume;
•changes in distribution channels;
•excess and obsolete inventory and inventory holding charges;
•expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;
•tariffs assessed on our products imported to the U.S. and elsewhere; and
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain
profitability.
We are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which has adversely affected, and may
continue to adversely affect, our gross margins.
The solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time. We have reduced the prices
of our products in the past, and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future,
including from our major customers. In addition, we have reduced our prices ahead of planned cost reductions of our
products, which has adversely affected our gross margins. When seeking to maintain or increase their market share, our
competitors may also reduce the prices of their products. In addition, our customers may have the ability or seek to
internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge, which would add
additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices. If we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling
prices by increasing our sales volume, reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products, our gross margins
would continue to be adversely affected.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 35
Table of Contents
Given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological
change, a principal component of our business strategy is reducing the costs to manufacture our products to remain
competitive. If our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the
efficiency of their products, our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency, and we may be
forced to sell our products at a price lower than our cost. Further, if raw materials costs and other third-party component
costs were to increase, we may not meet our cost reduction targets. If we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction
roadmap, we may not be able to remain price competitive, which would result in lost market share and lower gross
margins.
A drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources, or a change
in utility pricing structures, may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar PV system is strongly influenced by the cost of
electricity generated by solar PV installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other
renewable energy sources, including electricity from solar PV installations using central inverters. Decreases in the retail
prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar PV systems to compete. In particular, growth
in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep
natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future. Persistent low natural gas prices, lower prices of electricity
produced from other energy sources, such as nuclear power or coal-fired plants, or improvements to the utility
infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid, making the purchase of solar PV systems less
economically attractive and depressing sales of our products. In addition, energy conservation technologies and public
initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid.
Moreover, technological developments by our competitors in the solar industry, including manufacturers of central inverters
and DC-to-DC optimizers, could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that
can be achieved from solar PV installations based on our product platform, which could result in reduced demand for our
products. Additionally, as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business
models or utility infrastructure, utilities may change their pricing structures to increase the cost of installation or operation of
solar distributed generation. Such measures can include grid access fees, costly or lengthy interconnection studies,
limitations on distributed generation penetration levels, or other measures. If the cost of electricity generated by solar PV
installations incorporating our solutions is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources, our business, financial
condition and results of operations may be harmed.
If we do not forecast demand for our products accurately, we may experience product shortages, delays in
product shipment, excess product inventory, difficulties in planning expenses or disputes with suppliers, any of
which will adversely affect our business and financial condition.
We manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand. This process requires us to make
multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors, their end customers and general market
conditions. Because we sell most of our products to distributors, who in turn sell to their end customers, we have limited
visibility as to end-customer demand. We depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their end-
customer demand, and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions. If the information from
our distributors turns out to be incorrect, then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate. Furthermore, we do not have long-
term purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers, and our sales are generally made by purchase orders
that may be canceled, changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty. As a result, it is difficult to forecast future
customer demand to plan our operations.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36
Table of Contents
If we overestimate demand for our products, or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed, we may
have excess inventory that we cannot sell. We may have to make significant provisions for inventory write-downs based on
events that are currently not known, and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material. We may
also become involved in disputes with our suppliers who may claim that we failed to fulfill forecast or minimum purchase
requirements. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end-customer
demand, and we may lose market share, damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential
revenue opportunities. Obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible, particularly
in the short term due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes, which could
prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and cost-efficient manner or at all. In addition, if we overestimate our production
requirements, our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory. If our contract
manufacturers, at our request, purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the
costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess parts
or products and recognize related inventory write-downs.
In addition, we plan our operating expenses, including research and development expenses, hiring needs and
inventory investments, in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue. If customer demand or revenue
for a particular period is lower than we expect, we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses
for that period, which would harm our operating results for that period.
Our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification, elimination or
expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar electricity applications.
To date, we have generated the majority of our revenues from North America, and a substantial majority of our
revenues come from the U.S., and revenues generated from the U.S. market have represented 82%, 84% and 69% of our
total revenue for annual period ending on December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We also expect to continue to
generate a substantial amount of our revenues from North America in the future.
There are a number of important incentives (including U.S. federal and state tax incentives) that are expected to
phase-out or terminate in the future, which could adversely affect sales of our products in North America and other
markets. For instance, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008 provided a 30% federal tax credit for
residential and commercial solar installations through December 31, 2019, which was reduced to a tax credit of 26% for
any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through December 31, 2022, and 22% thereafter to
December 31, 2023 before being reduced to 10% for commercial installations and 0% for residential installations beginning
on January 1, 2024. As a result, several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take
advantage of safe harbor guidance from the IRS published in June 2018, allowing them to preserve the historical 30%
investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after December 31, 2019.
These tax credits could be reduced or eliminated as part of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), changes or regulatory reform initiatives by the current Congress or the new presidential administration.
In addition, net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and, in some instances modified, which may have a
negative impact on future inverter sales. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from California’s residential solar
market and the existing California net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of
residential solar power systems. Future legislative or regulatory changes in California may discourage further growth in the
residential solar market.
A number of European countries, including Germany, Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom have adopted
reductions in or concluded their net energy metering or FiT programs. Certain countries have proposed or enacted taxes
levied on renewable energy. These and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in Europe and
may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in Europe.

We also sell our products in Australia. In 2012 Australia enacted a Renewable Energy Target that is intended to
ensure that 33,000 Gigawatt-hours of Australia’s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020. This policy supports
both the installation of large-scale centralized renewable generation projects, along with small-scale systems of under
100kW each for residential and small business customers. This target was met in 2019; however, the scheme continues to
require high-energy users to meet their obligations under the policy until 2030. During 2018, the states of Victoria and
South Australia introduced state-based incentive schemes, aimed at solar customers in the state of Victoria and battery
storage in the state of South Australia. Other Australian states and territories introduced similar programs in 2019. Any
change in, or failure to implement, these programs may adversely affect the demand for solar energy solutions in Australia.
U.S. federal and state tax credits, grants and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since
inception. However, unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential
solar market, the phase-out of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future. Reductions in
incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy, including local content requirements, have negatively affected and
may continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations as we seek to increase our
business domestically and abroad. Additionally, as we further expand to other countries, changes in incentive programs or
electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.
Although we had net income in the past two years, we cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability.
We had net income of $134.0 million and $161.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 where we incurred a net loss of $11.6 million. We incurred
substantial net losses from our inception through the year ended December 31, 2018, and we may not be able to sustain
profitability and may incur additional losses in the future. At December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of
$51.2 million. Our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons, many of which are outside
our control, including a decline in demand for our offerings, increased competition, a decrease in the growth of the solar
industry or our market share, future declines in average selling prices of our products, the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, the
imposition of additional tariffs applicable to our industry or our products, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities.
If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations, we may not be able to sustain profitability.
Risks Related to our Acquisition Activity
The failure to successfully develop new generation products that are compatible with those of SunPower could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our failure to continue to successfully integrate our microinverter products and software with SunPower’s solar
modules could negatively impact our revenue projections, impair goodwill, intangible assets recognized, and otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As of December 31, 2020, we have $28.5 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net for developed technology and
customer relationship and $21.1 million of goodwill acquired from SunPower pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement
transaction with SunPower in August 2018 (the “SunPower APA”). We make assumptions and estimates in this assessment
which are complex and often subjective. Our judgement and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including
external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our
internal forecasts. To the extent that the factors described above change, we could be required to record additional non-
cash impairment charges in the future, which could negatively affect our results of operations.
We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the SunPower transaction which may result in
conflicts between us and SunPower.
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the SunPower transaction will depend, to a large extent, on our ability
to successfully execute the terms of the SunPower Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”), which is a complex and time-
consuming process. Any delay, failure or breach of obligations under the MSA could adversely impact the expected
benefits of the transaction and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Additionally, in connection with the SunPower APA transaction, SunPower acquired 7.5 million shares of our common
stock and has the right to designate one member of our board of directors. Through its share ownership and board seat,
SunPower may have the ability to directly or indirectly influence our business, and conflicts may arise between us and
SunPower regarding corporate priorities and strategic objectives. As of December 31, 2020, SunPower held 3.5 million
shares of our common stock.
As part of growing our business, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. If we fail to
successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, then our business and operating results could be
harmed and our stock price could decline.
From time to time, we will undertake acquisitions to add new product lines and technologies, gain new sales
channels or enter into new sales territories. For example, in January 2021, we acquired Sofdesk Inc., a cloud-based solar
energy software company, to extend our solar offering through digital transformation, and on February 8, 2021 we
announced our pending acquisition of the solar design services business of DIN Engineering Services LLP. Acquisitions
involve numerous risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following:
•integrating the companies, assets, systems, products, sales channels and personnel that we acquire;
•higher than anticipated acquisition and integration costs and expenses;
•reliance on third parties to provide transition services for a period of time after closing to ensure an orderly
transition of the business;
•growing or maintaining revenues to justify the purchase price and the increased expenses associated with
acquisitions;
•entering into territories or markets with which we have limited or no prior experience;
•establishing or maintaining business relationships with customers, vendors and suppliers who may be new to us;
•overcoming the employee, customer, vendor and supplier turnover that may occur as a result of the acquisition;
•disruption of, and demands on, our ongoing business as a result of integration activities including diversion of
management's time and attention from running the day to day operations of our business;
•inability to implement uniform standards, disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls over financial
reporting and other procedures and policies in a timely manner;
•inability to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses,
products, technologies or personnel that we acquire; and
•potential post-closing disputes.
As part of undertaking an acquisition, we may also significantly revise our capital structure or operational budget,
such as issuing common stock that would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders, assuming liabilities or debt,
utilizing a substantial portion of our cash resources to pay for the acquisition or significantly increasing operating expenses.
Our acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in charges being taken in an individual quarter as well as future
periods, which results in variability in our quarterly earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate in any particular quarter may
also be impacted by acquisitions. Following the closing of an acquisition, we may also have disputes with the seller
regarding contractual requirements and covenants, purchase price adjustments, contingent payments or for indemnifiable
losses. Any such disputes may be time consuming and distract management from other aspects of our business. In
addition, if we increase the pace or size of acquisitions, we will have to expend significant management time and effort into
the transactions and integrations, and we may not have the proper human resources bandwidth to ensure successful
integrations and accordingly, our business could be harmed or the benefits of our acquisitions may not be realized.
As part of the terms of an acquisition, we may commit to pay additional contingent consideration if certain revenue or
other performance milestones are met. We are required to evaluate the fair value of such commitments at each reporting
date and adjust the amount recorded if there are changes to the fair value.
We cannot ensure that we will be successful in selecting, executing and integrating acquisitions. Failure to manage
and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. In addition, if stock market
analysts or our stockholders do not support or believe in the value of the acquisitions that we choose to undertake, our
stock price may decline.

We invest in companies for both strategic and financial reasons but may not realize a return on our investments
We have made, and continue to seek to make, investments in companies around the world to further our strategic
objectives and support our key business initiatives. These investments may include equity or debt instruments of public or
private companies and may be non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. We do not restrict the types of
companies in which we seek to invest. These companies may range from early-stage companies that are often still defining
their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. If any company
in which we invest fails, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that an other-than-
temporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have
invested, we will have to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment
loss. The performance of any of these investments could result in significant impairment charges and gains (losses) on
other equity investments. We must also analyze accounting and legal issues when making these investments. If we do not
structure these investments properly, we may be subject to certain unfavorable accounting impact, such as potential
consolidation of financial results.
Furthermore, if the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business
diverges from our strategic objectives, we may seek to dispose of the investment. Our non-marketable equity investments
in private companies are not liquid, and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all.
The occurrence of any of these events could harm our results. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from
expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities and impairment charges related
to debt instruments as well as equity and other investments.
Risks Related to our Debt and Equity Securities
Conversion of our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise
depress the price of our common stock, adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
In March 2020, we issued and sold a total of $320.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Notes due 2025 (the
“Notes due 2025”).
In June 2019, we issued and sold a total of $132.0 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes
due 2024 (the “Notes due 2024”).
In August 2018, we issued and sold a total of $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior
notes due 2023 (the “Notes due 2023”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and an affiliate of ours. In
May 2019, we entered into separately and privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the Notes due 2023
resulting in the repurchase and exchange of $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes in consideration for the
issuance of shares of common stock and separate cash payments.
The Conversion Condition for the Notes due 2024 was met for all quarters ended March 31, 2020 through December
31, 2020. Therefore, our Notes due 2024 became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on April 1, 2020 and continue
to be convertible through March 31, 2021. Accordingly, we classified the net carrying amount of the Notes due 2024 of
$69.0 million as debt, current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. From January 1, 2021 through
February 12, 2021, we have received the request for conversion of approximately $61.5 million in principal amount of our
Notes due 2024, of which we have elected to settle the aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 in a combination
of cash and any excess in shares of our common stock in accordance with the applicable indenture. Such conversion will
be settled in March 2021. We may purchase shares under the convertible note hedge to the extent shares of our common
stock are issued for the additional conversion amount due over the principal amount. From January 1, 2021 through
February 12, 2021, we had not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge and the warrants had not been
exercised and remain outstanding. If we receive additional requests for conversion from the holders of the Notes due 2024
to exercise their right to convert the debt to equity, we have asserted our intent and ability to settle the remaining
$26.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 in cash.
The Conversion Condition for the Notes due 2025 was met during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Therefore,
our Notes due 2025 became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on January 1, 2021 and continue to be convertible
through March 31, 2021. Accordingly, we have classified the net carrying amount of the Notes due 2025 of $255.0 million
as debt, current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, holders converted $43.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes due
2024, the principal amount of which was repaid in cash. Of the $43.9 million in aggregate principal amount, $38.5 million in
aggregate principal amount was settled pursuant to an exchange agreement entered into in December 2020 with certain
holders of Notes due 2024. In connection with the exchange agreement, we entered into partial unwind agreements to
unwind a number of warrants exercisable under the hedging arrangements previously entered into in connection with the
issuances of the Notes due 2024, and we issued approximately 2.1 million warrants on a net basis, resulting in a net
issuance of approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock to the holders with an aggregate fair value of
$301.0 million, representing the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes due 2024, which were fully
offset by shares received from our exercise of the associated note hedging arrangements discussed below. As of
December 31, 2020, warrants exercisable to purchase a total of approximately 4.3 million shares remain outstanding. The
total amount of $43.9 million paid to partially settle the Notes due 2024 was allocated between the liability and equity
components of the amount extinguished by determining the fair value of the liability component immediately prior to the
notes settlement and allocating that portion of the conversion price to the liability component in the amount of $37.2 million.
The residual of the conversion price of $6.7 million was allocated to the equity component of the Notes due 2024 as a
reduction of additional paid-in capital. The fair value of the notes settlement was calculated using a discount rate of 5.75%,
representing an estimate of our borrowing rate at the date of repurchase with a remaining expected life of approximately
3.6 years. As part of the settlement, we wrote-off the $8.9 million unamortized debt discount and $0.8 million debt issuance
cost apportioned to the principal amount of Notes due 2024 settled. We also recorded a loss on partial settlement of the
Notes due 2024 of $3.0 million in other expense, net, representing the difference between the consideration attributed to
the liability component and the sum of the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance
costs. As of December 31, 2020, $88.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 remains outstanding.
We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the first quarter of 2021. If more holders
elect to convert their Notes due 2024 and Notes due 2025 in future periods, we intend to settle all or a portion of our
conversion obligation related to the aggregate principal amount in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity and result
in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, to the extent we
receive conversion requests, we may also record a loss on early conversions of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2025
converted by note holders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the
settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance on the settlement
date.
As of December 31, 2020,
•$320.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2025 were outstanding; (the foregoing, collectively, the
“Convertible Notes”);
•$88.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 were outstanding; and
•$5.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2023 were outstanding; (the foregoing, collectively, the
“Convertible Notes”).
The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders.
Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing
market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by
market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition,
the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our
common stock.

Servicing our debts requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our
business to pay our debts.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness,
including the Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive
and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future
sufficient to service our debts, including the Convertible Notes, and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable
to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or
obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness,
including the Convertible Notes, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be
able to engage in any of those activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on
our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Convertible Notes.
We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes or
repurchase the Convertible Note upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our
ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes.
Holders of our Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the
occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Fundamental change is defined in the
Convertible Notes Indenture entered into in connection with the financing and consists of events such as an acquisition of a
majority of our outstanding common stock, an acquisition of our company or substantially all of our assets, the approval by
our stockholders of a plan of liquidation or dissolution, or our common stock no longer being listed on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely
shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we
will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have
enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make such repurchase of the
Convertible Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the
Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our
failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the relevant indenture or to pay any cash payable
on future conversions of the notes as required by the relevant indenture would constitute a default under the relevant
indenture. A default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements
governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any
applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the
Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.
The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions and/or their early termination may affect the value of our
common stock.
In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024, we entered into privately negotiated
convertible note hedge transactions pursuant to which we have the option to purchase approximately the same number of
shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024, at a price
approximately the same as the initial conversion price of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024. These transactions are
expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes due 2025 and
Notes due 2024. Separately, we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions to acquire the same number of
shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024 (subject to
customary anti-dilution adjustments) at an initial strike price of approximately $81.54 per share and $25.23 per share for
Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024, respectively. If the market value per share of our common stock, as measured under
the warrants, exceeds the strike price of the warrants, the warrants will have a dilutive effect on the ownership interests of
existing stockholders and on our earnings per share, unless we elect, subject to certain conditions, to settle the warrants in
cash. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time of settlement.
In addition, the existence of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may encourage purchasing and
selling share of our common stock, or other of our securities and instruments, in open market and/or privately negotiated
transactions in order to modify hedge positions. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common
stock and the value of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024.

Changes in current accounting methods, standards, or regulations applicable to the Convertible Notes due 2025
and Notes due 2024 could have a material impact on our reported financial results, future financial results, future
cash flows, and/or our stock price.
Under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 470-20, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options,” an entity must
separately account for the host contract and conversion option associated with convertible debt instruments, such as the
Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024, that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, in a manner that
reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. For Notes due 2024, conversion option meets the classification of an equity
component, hence we have included the equity component in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity
on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date. For Notes due 2025, conversion option met the
classification of an embedded derivative liability, from March 9, 2020 to May 19, 2020, and hence we had included
embedded derivative liability in the Debt, non-current on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date.
Effective upon the filing of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation on May 20, 2020, the conversion option of the
Notes due 2025 met the classification of an equity component, hence we reclassified the embedded derivative liability in
the Debt, non-current to additional paid-in capital section of stockholders’ equity on our condensed consolidated balance
sheet on May 20, 2020. This change in fair value of derivatives has resulted in a charge recognized of $44.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020. We have treated the value of the equity component and embedded derivative liability as
debt discount for the host contract at the issuance date. We are required to amortize the debt discount as non-cash interest
expense over the term of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024, which could adversely affect our reported or future
financial results or the trading price of our common stock.
In addition, we use the treasury stock method for convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes due 2024 since the
date of issuance and Notes due 2025 since May 20, 2020) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash, and the effect of
which is that any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per
share except to the extent that the conversion value of such notes exceeds their principal amount. In August 2020, the
FASB issued Account Standard Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-
20),” effective January 1, 2022, which requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability
measured at its amortized cost. Interest expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations will be close to the
coupon rate interest expense. Further, for the diluted earnings per share calculation, treasury stock method will no longer
be permitted. The if-converted method will be used for the calculation of the diluted earnings per share calculation, when
accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes due 2024 and Notes due 2025, which will adversely affect
our diluted earnings per share.
ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,”
clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be classified in the statement of cash flows, including the cash
settlement for our Notes due 2024 and Notes due 2025. Upon cash settlement, repayment of the principal amount will be
bifurcated between cash outflows for operating activities for the portion related to accreted interest attributable to debt
discounts arising from the difference between the coupon interest rate and the effective interest rate, and financing
activities for the remainder. This will require us to classify the debt discount totaling $36.4 million for Notes due 2024 and
$68.7 million for Notes due 2025 of accreted interest as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statement of
cash flows upon cash settlement, if and when such cash settlement occurs prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 discussed
above, which could adversely affect our future cash flow from operations. In our consolidated statement of cash flows for
the year ended December 31, 2020, $3.1 million of the debt discount associated with the conversion of $43.9 million in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 was classified as cash used in operating activities.
The market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
The market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among
other things, the other risk factors described herein, and other factors beyond our control, such as quarterly variations in
operating results, announcements of technology innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes in financial
estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that
investors may deem comparable to us, and new reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions.
These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These
broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions,
interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock,
regardless of our operating performance.

In addition, in the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been
subject to securities class action litigation. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities
litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns,
which could seriously harm our business.
Our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, which may lead to
volatility in our stock price.
Our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from
quarter to quarter. As a result, the trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and
could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, the
trading prices of the securities of solar companies in general have been highly volatile, and the volatility in market price and
trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the
securities. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock, some of which are beyond our control, include:
•seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for our products;
•the timing, volume and product mix of sales of our products, which may have different average selling prices or
profit margins;
•changes in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;
•the impacts and the evolving effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, sales and results of
operations;
•our ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner
and that meet customer requirements;
•our ability to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers, customers and suppliers;
•quality control or yield problems in our manufacturing operations;
•the anticipation, announcement or introductions of new or enhanced products by our competitors and ourselves;
•reductions in the retail price of electricity;
•changes in laws, regulations and policies applicable to our business and products, particularly those relating to
government incentives for solar energy applications;
•the impact of tariffs on the solar industry in general and our products in particular;
•unanticipated increases in costs or expenses;
•the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of
our business operations;
•the impact of government-sponsored programs on our customers;
•our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, particularly in light of the fact that some of our customers are
relatively new entrants to the solar market without long operating or credit histories and impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic they may experience;
•our ability to estimate future warranty obligations due to product failure rates, claim rates or replacement costs;
•our ability to forecast our customer demand and manufacturing requirements, and manage our inventory;
•fluctuations in our gross profit;
•our ability to predict our revenue and plan our expenses appropriately;
•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•announcement of acquisitions or dispositions of our assets or business operations;
•issuances of our common stock or equity-linked securities such as the Convertible Notes;

•changes in our management;
•technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock that may produce price movements that may
or may not comport to macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the
sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites),
the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other
derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging or other technical trading factors;
•general economic conditions and changes in such conditions specific to our target markets; and
•actions by research analysts, such as if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock or
cease publishing reports about us or our business.
The above factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect
our quarterly and annual results of operations. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue
shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations. Moreover, our results of
operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the
price of our common stock could decrease significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully
address these risks.
If research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or
downgrade our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish
about us and our business. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our
stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one
or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for
our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
We may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on
favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient
to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional capital or
debt financing to execute on our current or future business strategies, including to:
•provide additional cash reserves to support our operations;
•invest in our research and development efforts;
•expand our operations into new product markets and new geographies;
•acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies; or
•otherwise pursue our strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures, including adjustments to our
business to mitigate the effects of any tariffs that might apply to us or our industry.
Additionally, while we have not repurchased any shares under the plan, our Board of Directors has authorized the
repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock through open market purchases or through structured repurchase
agreements with third parties. Such purchases are expected to continue through March 2022 unless otherwise extended or
shortened by our Board of Directors.
We do not know what forms of financing, if any, will be available to us. If financing is not available on acceptable
terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, enhance our research and development and sales and
marketing functions, develop and enhance our products, respond to unanticipated events and opportunities, or otherwise
respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. In any such event, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially harmed, and we may be unable to continue our operations. Moreover, if we raise
additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders
could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those
of existing stockholders.

Our affiliated stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock, and they
may take actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial.
Our affiliated stockholders, executive officers and directors collectively own, and will continue to own after giving
effect to this offering, a significant percentage of our common stock. This significant concentration of share ownership may
adversely affect the trading price for our common stock and the notes because investors often perceive disadvantages in
owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, as a result, these stockholders, acting together, may be able
to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets.
Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, including
a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a
tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders
could cause our stock price to fall.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales
might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the
sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of
our common stock. All of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in
some cases to agreed limits on sale volumes and the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of Rule 144
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Sales of stock by our stockholders could have a
material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.
Certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the
Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable
without restriction under the Securities Act. For instance, in December in 2018, we filed a resale registration statement
related to the approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock that were issued to SunPower upon the closing of the
APA transaction. Any sales of securities by SunPower or other stockholders with registration rights could have a material
adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.
Manipulative techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock.
Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own, but rather has borrowed from a third
party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. Short sellers hope to profit
from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the
replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short
seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of,
negative opinions regarding the issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and
generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. The use of the Internet, social media, and blogging have allowed
short sellers to publicly attack a company’s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called “research reports” that
mimic the type of investment analysis performed by legitimate securities research analysts. These short attacks have in the
past led to stock price declines and significant selling activity in our common stock. Issuers with limited trading volumes or
substantial retail shareholder bases can be particularly susceptible to higher volatility levels, and can be particularly
vulnerable to such short attacks.
Short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority
in the U.S., are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the SEC in Regulation Analyst Certification and,
accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or, in some cases, outright fabrications.
In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the significant profits that can be made from running
successful short attacks, short sellers have issued such reports on our stock and will likely continue to issue such reports.
Such short-seller attacks may cause our stock to suffer a decline in market price.
We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to
achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 46
Table of Contents
We currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition,
our term loan agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, an investor’s only opportunity to achieve a
return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells
its shares at a profit.
Our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could
also reduce the market price of our stock.
Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of
our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate
actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:
•providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms, which could delay the ability of
stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;
•not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to
elect director candidates;
•authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of
common stock, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;
•prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or
special meeting of our stockholders;
•requiring the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding
shares of voting stock, voting as a single class, to amend provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to
the management of our business, our board of directors, stockholder action by written consent, advance
notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, forum selection and the liability of our directors, or to
amend our bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of stockholders or an acquiror to effect such amendments to
facilitate changes in management or an unsolicited takeover attempt;
•requiring special meetings of stockholders may only be called by our chairman of the board, if any, our chief
executive officer, our president or a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our
stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and
•requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, which may discourage or deter a
potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law may prohibit large stockholders, in
particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations,
without approval of substantially all of our stockholders, for a certain period of time.
These provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential
takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and
result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.
General Risks Related to our Business
Natural disasters, public health events, significant disruptions of information technology systems, data security
breaches, or other catastrophic events could adversely affect our operations.
Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters, public health events and other business disruptions,
which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our
corporate headquarters in Fremont, California is located near major earthquake fault lines and our Petaluma, California
facility is near fault lines and the sites of recent catastrophic wildfires. We rely on third-party manufacturing facilities
including for all product assembly and final testing of our products, which are performed at third-party manufacturing
facilities, in China, Mexico and India. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including
public health issues (for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or an outbreak of other contagious diseases or health
epidemics), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or
general economic or political factors. Such risks could result in an increase
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47
Table of Contents
in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export
licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes,
restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could
ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.
Further, any terrorist attacks, material disruption to our information technology systems or any data security
breaches, including due to cyber-attacks, especially any aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our
cloud-based monitoring service, could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products or
otherwise adverse affect us. Such significant disruptions of our, our third party vendors’ and/or business partners’
information technology systems or data security breaches, including in our remote work environment as a result of COVID-
19, could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access,
use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual
property, proprietary business information and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business and
reputational harm to us. Any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information,
including personal information regarding our customers, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or
state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the
correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy
and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or
result in legal and financial exposure. In addition, security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to
detect, and any delay in identifying them may further harm us. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices to access
confidential information increases the risk of security breaches. While we have implemented security measures to protect
our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service
interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal
accounting controls related to security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and
accurate financial statements and subject us to regulatory scrutiny.
In the event that natural disasters, public health epidemics or technical catastrophes were to damage or destroy any
part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer, destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our
operations or services for any extended period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected.
The threat of global economic, capital markets and credit disruptions, including sovereign debt issues, pose risks
to our business.
The threat of global economic, capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks to our business. These risks include
slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services. These economic
developments, particularly decreased credit availability, have in the past reduced demand for solar products. For instance,
the European sovereign debt crisis in recent years has caused and may continue to cause European governments to
reduce, eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy, which could limit our
growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. These conditions, including reduced incentives, continued decreases in credit availability, as well as continued
economic instability, have and may continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations
as we seek to increase our sales internationally.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 48
Table of Contents
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our
internal controls, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud; in that case, our
stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could
negatively impact the price of our stock.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition,
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and
disclosure controls procedures. The process of implementing our internal controls and complying with Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required, and will continue to require, significant attention of management. If we or our
independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting,
the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and
harm our stock price. To the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified,
we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses
or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings.
Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities.
We are subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct
business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic
and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”) contained many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, the
consequences of which could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future
U.S. income tax expense. As additional guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as new accounting
treatment is clarified, we may report additional adjustments in the period if new information becomes available. We have a
significant amount of deferred tax assets and a portion of the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax
credits could be subject to limitations under the Code Sections 382 or 383, separate return limitation year rules. The
limitations could reduce our ability to utilize our net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.
Tax law changes or the limitations could be material and could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.
In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax,
indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot be
certain that the final determination of our tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected
in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or
litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income (loss) in the period or periods
for which that determination is made.
Our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles.
We have been and could continue to be subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the majority of
our revenues are from the North American and European regions which experience higher sales of our products in the
second, third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends, including weather patterns
and construction cycles. The first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry, due to these same
factors. In the U.S., customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take
advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons. In addition, construction levels are typically slower in colder and wetter
months. In European countries with FiTs, the construction of solar PV systems may be concentrated during the second half
of the calendar year, largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum FiT and the fact that the coldest winter
months are January through March. Accordingly, our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by
seasonal fluctuations in the future.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we might be subject to various legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations.
The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period
for amounts above management’s expectations, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for
that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Except as described in this Item 3, we are not currently
involved in any material legal proceedings, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our
operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
Class Action Suit
On or about June 17, 2020, Gregory A. Hurst (“Plaintiff”) filed a securities class action lawsuit against our company,
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer (collectively, the "Defendants") in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California on behalf of a class consisting of those individuals who purchased or otherwise
acquired our common stock between February 26, 2019 and June 17, 2020 (the “Hurst Action”). The complaint alleges that
the Defendants made false and/or misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff does not quantify any alleged damages in his complaint but, in
addition to attorneys' fees and costs, he seeks to recover damages on behalf of himself and other persons who purchased
or otherwise acquired our stock during the putative class period at allegedly inflated prices and purportedly suffered
financial harm as a result. The court appointed Plaintiff as the Lead Plaintiff on November 30, 2020. On December 7, 2020,
the court granted the parties’ stipulation setting the schedule for the filing of an amended complaint and Defendants’
anticipated motion to dismiss. On January 22, 2021, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint against Defendants asserting
substantially the same allegations as the original complaint purportedly on behalf of individuals who purchased or otherwise
acquired Enphase common stock between February 26, 2019 and June 16, 2020. We dispute all allegations, intend to
defend the matter vigorously and believe the claims are without merit.
Derivative Action Suit
On or about July 10, 2020, Yan Shen filed a verified shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Shen v.
Kothandaraman, et al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Badrinarayanan
Kothandaraman, Eric Branderiz, Mandy Yang, Steven J. Gomo, Benjamin Kortlang, Richard Mora, Thurman J. Rodgers,
and Enphase Energy, Inc. (nominal defendant) alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control,
gross mismanagement, waste, and violations of Section 14(a) under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Shen Action”). The
plaintiff does not quantify any alleged damages in the complaint, but in addition to attorneys’ fees and costs, seeks a
proposal to strengthen the Board’s supervision of operations and shareholder input into the policies and guidelines of the
Board; to permit our shareholders to nominate at least three candidates for election to the Board; and to ensure the
establishment of effective oversight of compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations; and restitution from the
individual defendants. On September 24, 2020, the court entered an order staying the derivative action until all motions to
dismiss the securities class action are decided.
On October 28, 2020, Benjamin Weber filed a verified shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Weber v.
Kothandaraman, et al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Badrinarayanan
Kothandaraman, Eric Branderiz, Mandy Yang, Steven J. Gomo, Benjamin Kortlang, Richard Mora, Thurman J. Rodgers,
and Enphase Energy, Inc. (nominal defendant) containing substantially the same allegations
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 50
Table of Contents
as those in the Shen Action (the “Weber Action”). On November 20, 2020, the court consolidated the Shen and Weber
Actions, ordered them related to the Hurst Action, and ordered the terms of the stay previously entered in the Shen Action
to apply to the newly consolidated action under Lead Case No. 3:20-cv-04623-BLF (the “Consolidated Derivative Action”)
and all subsequently filed derivative lawsuits arising out of substantially the same allegations as the Consolidated
Derivative Action.
On November 18, 2020, Anthony R. Buch filed a verified shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Buch v.
Kothandaraman, et al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Badrinarayanan
Kothandaraman, Eric Branderiz, Mandy Yang, Steven J. Gomo, Benjamin Kortlang, Richard Mora, Thurman J. Rodgers,
and Enphase Energy, Inc. (nominal defendant) containing substantially the same allegations as those in the Consolidated
Derivative Action (the “Buch Action”). On December 2, 2020, the court granted the parties stipulation to consolidate the
Buch Action with the Consolidated Derivative Action.
On December 9, 2020, Frank Caggiano filed a verified shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Caggiano v.
Kothandaraman, et al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Badrinarayanan
Kothandaraman, Eric Branderiz, Mandy Yang, Steven J. Gomo, Benjamin Kortlang, Richard Mora, Thurman J. Rodgers,
and Enphase Energy, Inc. (nominal defendant) containing substantially the same allegations as those in the Consolidated
Derivative Action (the “Caggiano Action”). On December 24, 2020, the court granted the parties stipulation to consolidate
the Caggiano Action with the Consolidated Derivative Action.
We dispute the allegations in each of the above-reference derivative lawsuits, and we intend to defend the matter
vigorously and believe the claims are without merit.
Books and Records Suit
On September 15, 2020, Stanley Olochwoszcz filed a lawsuit against our company in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, 8 Del. C. § 220, to compel the
company to permit Mr. Olochwoszcz to inspect certain of our books and records (the “Section 220 Litigation”). The
complaint alleges that our company has wrongfully refused to produce documents in response to Mr. Olochwoszcz’s
demand and seeks a court order compelling us to permit inspection and copying of certain of our books and records, as
well as costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, related to the lawsuit. We have also received similar demands for
inspection of our books and records from four other company stockholders.
On February 4, 2021, Mr. Olochwoszcz and three other demanding stockholders—Teamsters Local 677 Health
Services & Insurance Plan, Saratoga Advantage Trust Small Capitalization Portfolio and Leo Schumacher—filed in the
Section 220 Litigation a stipulation to intervene on a limited basis. The parties agreed to the limited intervention, a
confidentiality agreement, and a stay of the Section 220 Litigation in connection with a document production agreement
between the Company and four of the five demanding stockholders. Pursuant to the stay agreement, the Section 220
Litigation will be stayed to allow the parties to explore the resolution of the demands.
The pending lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense
and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of the pending lawsuits and any other related
lawsuits is necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of the pending lawsuits
and any additional lawsuits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in
connection with such lawsuits.

Securities
Common Stock
Our common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, has been traded on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol
“ENPH” since March 30, 2012.
Holders
As of February 8, 2021, there were approximately 19 holders of record of our common stock, one of which was Cede
& Co., a nominee for Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). All of the shares of our common stock held by brokerage firms,
banks and other financial institutions as nominees for beneficial owners are deposited into participant accounts at DTC and
are therefore considered to be held of record by Cede & Co. as one stockholder.
Dividend Policy
We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain any
available funds to invest in the growth and operation of our business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in
the foreseeable future.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Issuer Repurchases of Securities
Except as previously reported in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the
SEC during the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no unregistered sales of equity securities by us during the year
ended December 31, 2020.
In April 2020, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock,
exclusive of brokerage commissions. Purchases will be completed from time to time in the open market or through
structured repurchase agreements with third parties. Such purchases are expected to continue through March 2022 unless
otherwise extended or shortened by our board of directors. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on a variety
of factors, including the price of our common stock compared to the intrinsic value, alternative investment opportunities,
corporate and regulatory requirements and market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, we have not repurchased any
shares under this repurchase program.

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together
with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,”
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “intend,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. Such statements, include but are not limited to statements regarding our expectations as to future
financial performance, expense levels, liquidity sources, the capabilities and performance of our technology and products
and planned changes, timing of new product releases, our business strategies, including anticipated trends, growth and
developments in markets in which we target, the anticipated market adoption of our current and future products,
performance in operations, including component supply management, product quality and customer service, risks related to
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated benefits and risks relating to the transaction with SunPower
Corporation. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking
statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk
Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Overview and 2020 Highlights
We are a global energy technology company. We deliver smart, easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation,
storage and communication on one single platform. We revolutionized the solar industry with our microinverter technology
and we produce a fully integrated solar-plus-storage solution. To date, we have shipped more than 32 million
microinverters, and approximately 1.4 million Enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more
than 130 countries.
We sell our solutions primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers. We also sell directly to large
installers, OEMs, strategic partners and homeowners. Our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020
was positively impacted by the scheduled phase-down of the investment tax credit for solar projects under Section 48(a)
(the “ITC”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 
The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008 provided a 30% federal tax credit for residential and
commercial solar installations through December 31, 2019, which was reduced to a tax credit of 26% for any solar energy
system that began construction during 2020 through December 31, 2022, and 22% thereafter to December 31, 2023 before
being reduced to 10% for commercial installations and 0% for residential installations beginning on January 1, 2024. As a
result, several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor
guidance from the IRS published in June 2018, allowing them to preserve the historical 30% investment tax credit for solar
equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after December 31, 2019. Safe harbor prepayments
from customers in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulted in $44.5 million of revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2020
when we delivered the product.
On March 9, 2020, we issued $320.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2025
(the “Notes due 2025”) in a private placement. The Notes due 2025 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at
a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1,
2020. The Notes due 2025 will mature on March 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the
holders. Further information relating to the Notes due 2025 may be found in Note 11, “Debt,” of the notes to consolidated
financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and below under the section titled “-
Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

On March 26, 2020, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (the “USTR”) announced certain exclusion
requests related to tariffs on Chinese imported microinverter products that fit the dimensions and weight limits within a
Section 301 Tariff exclusion under U.S. note 20(ss)(40) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of
the United States (the “Tariff Exclusion”). The Tariff Exclusion applies to covered products under the China Section 301
Tariff Actions (“Section 301 Tariffs”) taken by the USTR exported from China to the United States from September 24, 2018
until August 7, 2020. Accordingly, we sought refunds totaling approximately $38.9 million plus approximately $0.6 million
accrued interest on tariffs previously paid from September 24, 2018 to March 31, 2020 for certain microinverters that qualify
for the Tariff Exclusion. The refund request was subject to review and approval by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
therefore, we assessed that the probable loss recovery for the year ended December 31, 2020 is equal to the approved
refund requests available to us prior to issuance of the financial statements on February 12, 2021.
As of December 31, 2020, we have received $24.8 million of tariff refunds and accrued for the remaining $14.7
million tariff refunds that were approved, however, not yet received on or before December 31, 2020. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, we recorded $38.9 million as a reduction to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of
operations as the approved refunds relate to paid tariffs previously recorded to cost of revenues; therefore, we recorded the
corresponding approved tariff refunds as credits to cost of revenues in the current period. For the year ended December
31, 2020, we recorded the $0.6 million accrued interest as interest income in our consolidated statement of operations. The
tariff refund receivable of $14.7 million is recorded as a reduction of accounts payable to Flex Ltd. and affiliates (“Flex”), our
manufacturing partner and the importer of record who will first receive the tariff refunds, on the consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2020.
The Tariff Exclusion expired on August 7, 2020 and those microinverter products now are subject to tariffs. We
continue to pay Section 301 Tariffs on our storage and communication products and other accessories imported from China
which are not subject to the Tariff Exclusion.
In December 2020, holders exchanged $43.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024, the
principal amount of which was repaid in cash. Of the $43.9 million in aggregate principal amount, $38.5 million in aggregate
principal amount was settled pursuant to an exchange agreement entered into in December 2020 with certain holders of
Notes due 2024. We also issued approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock to the holders in December 2020
for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes due 2024, which were fully offset by shares
received from our exercise of the associated note hedging arrangements. Refer to Note 11. Debt, of the notes to
consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
In connection with the settlement of the Notes due 2024, we entered into partial unwind agreements to unwind number of
warrants exercisable under our note hedging arrangements and to issue approximately 2.1 million warrants on a net basis,
resulting in a net issuance of approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock in connection with the exchange of the
Notes due 2024.
Impact of COVID-19
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause disruptions and uncertainties, including in the core markets in
which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services and
had a notable impact on general economic conditions including but not limited to the temporary closures of many
businesses, “shelter in place” orders and other governmental regulations, and reduced consumer spending. The most
significant near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our financial performance are a decline in sales orders as future residential
and commercial system owners are canceling sales meetings with system installation professionals or postponing system
installations. As the purchase of new solar energy management solutions declines as part of the impact of COVID-19 on
consumer spending, many businesses through which we distribute our products are working at limited operational capacity.
The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance will depend on various future
developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our employees, impact on our customers,
effect on our sales cycles or costs, and effect on our supply chain and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be
predicted, but which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Further information relating to the risks and uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may be found in Part
I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations
Net Revenues
We primarily generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter solutions and related accessories, which include
our storage systems, our Envoy communications gateway and Enlighten cloud-based monitoring service as well as other
accessories.
Our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our solutions and related
accessories, supply and demand, sales incentives, and competitive product offerings. Our revenue growth is dependent on
our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive, developing and introducing new
products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, the diversification and
expansion of our revenue base, and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for
microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs, warranty, manufacturing personnel and logistics costs,
freight costs, depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs. Our product costs are impacted
by technological innovations, such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions, economies of
scale resulting in lower component costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. Certain costs,
primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment, are not directly affected by sales volume.
We outsource our manufacturing to third-party contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with
them on a quarterly basis. We believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the
anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future. However, shortages in the supply of certain key raw
materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We contract with third parties,
including one of our contract manufacturers, to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products
in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices, product cost,
product mix, customer mix, tariff refunds, warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and
restructuring expenses. Personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories
other than restructuring expense and include salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, sales commissions, incentive compensation
and stock-based compensation.
Research and development expense include personnel-related expenses, third-party design and development costs,
testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other indirect costs. Research and development employees are
primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics, semiconductors, powerline communications,
networking and software functionality, and storage. We devote substantial resources to research and development
programs that focus on enhancements to, and cost efficiencies in, our existing products and timely development of new
products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs, improve functionality, and enhance reliability. We
intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are
critical to maintaining our competitive position.
Sales and marketing expense include personnel-related expenses, travel, trade shows, marketing, customer support
and other indirect costs. We expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to
increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors,
large installers, OEMs and strategic partners. We currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets
in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central American markets, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India and certain other Asian
markets. We expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in
addressable markets in the future.
General and administrative expense include personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, human
resources, information technology and legal organizations, facilities costs, and fees for professional services. Fees for
professional services consist primarily of outside legal, accounting and information technology consulting costs.

Table of Contents
Restructuring charges are the net charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2018 through 2019
(the “2018 Plan”) to improve operational performance and reduce overall operating expenses. Under the 2018 Plan, costs
included in restructuring primarily consisted of employee severance and one-time benefits, workforce reorganization
charges, non-cash charges related to impairment of property and equipment, and the establishment of lease loss reserves.
See Note 10. “Restructuring,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Other Expense, Net
Other expense, net primarily consists of interest expense and fees under our convertible notes and term loans,
non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs, and non-
cash charge recognized for the change in fair value of our convertible notes embedded derivative and warrants. Other
expense, net also includes interest income on our cash balance, accrued interest on tariffs previously paid and approved
for refund, and gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into U.S. dollars.
Income Tax Benefit (Provision)
We are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. Historically, we have primarily been
subject to taxation in the U.S. because we have sold the majority of our products to customers in the U.S. As we have
expanded the sale of products to customers outside the U.S., we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign
statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place. As sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future, our
effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly. We regularly assess the ability to realize deferred tax assets based on the
weight of all available evidence, including such factors as the history of recent earnings and expected future taxable
income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, after considering these factors,
we determined that the positive evidence overcame any negative evidence, primarily due to cumulative income in recent
years, and the expectation of sustained profitability in future periods and concluded that it was more likely than not that the
US federal and state deferred tax assets were realizable. As a result, we released the valuation allowance against all of the
U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

2020 2019 $ %
(In thousands, except percentages)
Net revenues $ 774,425 $ 624,333 $ 150,092 24 %
Net revenues increased by 24% or $150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same
period in 2019, primarily due to the 11% increase in microinverter unit volume shipped primarily as a result of business
growth in the U.S., higher microinverter units shipped in the first quarter of 2020 as our customers took advantage of safe
harbor guidance from the IRS and shipments of our Enphase Encharge storage systems to customers in North America.
We sold approximately 6.8 million microinverter units in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately
6.2 million microinverter units in the same period in 2019.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Years Ended December 31, Change in

Gross profit 345,981 221,245 124,736 56 %
Gross margin 44.7 % 35.4 %
Cost of revenues increased by 6% or $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same
period in 2019, primarily due to higher volume of microinverter units sold and shipments of our Enphase Encharge storage
systems primarily as a result of business growth in the U.S., as well as higher units shipped in the first quarter of 2020 as
our customers took advantage of safe harbor guidance from the IRS, partially offset by the $38.9 million in refunds
approved for tariffs mentioned above and a decrease in the unit cost of our products as a result of our cost reduction
efforts.
Gross margin increased by 9.3 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same
period in 2019. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the $38.9 million in refunds approved for tariffs
mentioned above as well as our overall pricing and cost management efforts, including the transition of our contract
manufacturing to Mexico to mitigate tariffs.

Percentage of net revenues 7 % 6 %
Research and development expense increased by 38% or $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as
compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to $13.6 million higher personnel-related expenses
and $2.5 million of outside consulting, engineering services and equipment associated with the innovation and
development, introduction and qualification of new products, partially offset by a $0.6 million reduction in travel expenditure
as we implemented travel restrictions prohibiting all non-essential business travel. The increase in personnel-related
expenses was primarily due to hiring employees in New Zealand, India and US, increasing total compensation costs. The
amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to differing levels and stages of
development activity.
Sales and Marketing

Percentage of net revenues 7 % 6 %
Sales and marketing expense increased by 44% or $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to $11.4 million of higher personnel-related
expenses as a result of our efforts to improve customer experience by hiring additional employees to reduce the average
call wait time for customers, as well as support our business growth in the U.S. and international expansion in Europe, and
$5.5 million for a combination of higher marketing expenses, professional services, advertising costs and facilities costs to
enable business growth, partially offset by $0.7 million reduction in travel expenditure as we implemented travel restrictions
prohibiting all non-essential business travel and converting where possible our in-person sales, trainings and marketing
events to virtual-only due to COVID-19.

Interest income of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased, as compared to $2.5 million in
the same period in 2019, primarily due to significant decline in interest rates earned on cash balances, partially offset by a
higher average cash balance earning interest in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019
and approximately $0.6 million accrued interest on refunds for tariffs previously paid from September 24, 2018 to March 31,
2020 for certain microinverters that qualify for the Tariff Exclusion.
Interest expense of $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily includes $20.2 million related to
the accretion of the debt discount and debt issuance cost as well as coupon interest incurred associated with our Notes
due 2024 and Notes due 2025, $0.5 million of interest expense related to long-term financing receivable recorded as debt
and interest expense of $0.2 million related to coupon interest incurred and amortization of debt issuance costs associated
with our Notes due 2023. Interest expense of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily includes $4.6
million related to the coupon interest incurred, debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs with our Notes due
2024, interest expense of $2.7 million related to the repayment of our term loan, interest expense of $1.5 million related to
coupon interest incurred and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with Notes due 2023, and $0.9 million of
interest expense related to long-term financing receivable recorded as debt.
Other expense, net of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily related to $3.0 million non-cash
loss on settlement of $43.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 and $0.5 million net loss related to
foreign currency exchange and remeasurement. Other expense, net of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily relates to the $6.0 million fees paid for the repurchase and exchange of our Notes due 2023, partially offset by
$0.6 million net gain related to foreign currency exchange and remeasurement.
Change in fair value of derivatives of $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily includes the
charge recognized for the change in fair value of our convertible notes embedded derivative and warrants of $47.6 million
and $24.7 million, respectively. This charge is partially offset by a gain recognized for the change in fair value of our
convertible notes hedge of $28.0 million. See Note 11, “Debt,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in

The income tax benefit of $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased compared to the income
tax benefit of $71.0 million in 2019, primarily due to the valuation allowance release for the year ended December 31, 2019,
partially offset by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation tax deduction for year ended December 31,

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, we had $399.0 million in working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of $679.4
million, of which approximately $659.2 million were held in the U.S. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of
U.S. government money market mutual funds and both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits, with the
remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries. We consider amounts held outside the U.S. to be accessible and have
provided for the estimated U.S. income tax liability associated with our foreign earnings. However, our liquidity may be
negatively impacted if sales decline significantly for an extended period due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. While we have experienced delays in collections from certain customers due to COVID-19, we believe we will
be able to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Further, the extent to which the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto impact our business and liquidity will depend on
future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be precisely predicted at this time.
Convertible Notes
Notes due 2023. As of December 31, 2020, we had $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Notes due
2023 outstanding. The Notes due 2023 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per year,
payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The Notes due 2023 will mature on August 1, 2023,
unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders.
Notes due 2024. As of December 31, 2020, we had $88.1 million aggregate principal amount of our Notes due
2024 outstanding. The Notes due 2024 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 1.0% per year,
payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Notes due 2024 will mature on June 1, 2024, unless
earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders at a conversion price of $20.50 per share.
The Notes due 2024 may be converted on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding December 1, 2023, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under any of the
following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30,
2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the our common stock for at least 20 trading
days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading
day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $26.6513 (130% of the conversion price) on
each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the
“measurement period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of
notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of
the our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
events. Upon conversion of any of the notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a
combination of cash and common stock, at our election.
From April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, the Notes due 2024 may be converted because the last reported sale
price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on March 31,
2020, June, 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020 was greater than or equal to $26.6513 on each
applicable trading day. Upon conversion of any of the notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of
common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election.
In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2024, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge
transactions in order to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes due 2024.
Also, concurrently with the offering of the Notes due 2024, we entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions
whereby we issued warrants to effectively increase the overall conversion price of Notes due 2024 from $20.5010 to
$25.2320.

From January 1, 2021 through February 12, 2021, we’ve received the request for conversion of approximately
$61.5 million in principal amount of our Notes due 2024, of which we have elected to settle the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes due 2024 in a combination of cash and any excess in shares of our common stock in accordance with the
applicable indenture. Such conversion will be settled in March 2021. We may purchase shares under the convertible note
hedge to the extent shares of our common stock are issued for the additional conversion amount due over the principal
amount. From January 1, 2021 through February 12, 2021, we had not purchased any shares under the convertible note
hedge and the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding. If we receive additional request for conversion
from the holders of the Notes due 2024 to exercise their right to convert the debt to equity, we have asserted our intent and
ability to settle the remaining $26.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 in cash.
Notes due 2025. As of December 31, 2020, we had $320.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Notes due 2025
outstanding. The Notes due 2025 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable
semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2020. The Notes due 2025 will
mature on March 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders at a conversion price
of $81.54 per share.
The Notes due 2025 may be converted on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding September 1, 2024, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under any of the
following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2020
(and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the our common stock for at least 20 trading days
(whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day
of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $106.00 (130% of the conversion price) on each
applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the
“measurement period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of
notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of
the our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate
events. On and after September 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately
preceding the maturity date of March 1, 2025, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing
circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), holders may require
the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes due 2025 for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change
repurchase date.
From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021, the Notes due 2025 may be converted because the last reported
sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on
December 31, 2020 was greater than or equal to $106.00 on each applicable trading day. Upon conversion of any of the
notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common
stock, at our election.
In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2025, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge
transactions in order to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes due 2025. The
total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $89.1 million. Also, concurrently with the offering of
the Notes due 2025, we entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions whereby we issued warrants to acquire
shares of our common stock at a strike price of $106.94 rather than the Notes due 2025 conversion price of $81.54. We
received approximately $71.6 million from the sale of the warrants.
As of February 12, 2021, the Notes due 2025 were not converted into equity, therefore, we had not purchased any
shares under the convertible note hedge and the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding. If holders of the
Notes due 2025 are able to convert the debt to equity, and exercise that right, we have asserted our intent and ability to
settle the $320.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2025 in cash.
Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of
COVID-19 and other risks detailed in the ‘risk factor’ section in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form
10-K. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital
requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support
development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the
costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate
manufacturing capacity, the continuing market acceptance of our products and

macroeconomic events such as the impacts from COVID-19. We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt
financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms
acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and
financial condition may be adversely affected.
Stock Repurchase Program
In April 2020, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock,
exclusive of brokerage commissions. Purchases will be completed from time to time in the open market or through
structured repurchase agreements with third parties. Such purchases are expected to continue through March 2022 unless
otherwise extended or shortened by our board of directors. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on a variety
of factors, including the price of our common stock compared to the intrinsic value, alternative investment opportunities,
corporate and regulatory requirements and market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, we have not repurchased any
shares under this repurchase program.
Cash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

operating activities increased by $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in our gross profit as a result of increased revenue, $24.8 million cash
received of the total tariff refund request of $39.5 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses as we continue to
invest in the long-term growth of our business and also by $3.1 million cash repayment deemed as an amount paid for
settlement of $43.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 accreted debt discount. For more detail on

(2)Purchase obligations include amounts related to component inventory that our primary contract manufacturers procure
on our behalf in accordance with our production forecast as well as other inventory related purchase commitments. The
timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from estimates presented above due to fluctuations in
demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
SEC Regulation S-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities.
We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to
risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of COVID-19.
As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would
require us to update our estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. For a description of
our significant accounting policies, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the notes to consolidated
financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An accounting policy is considered to
be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at
the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the
accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial
statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.(1)

Revenue Recognition
We generate revenue from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units and related accessories, an
Envoy communications gateway, the cloud-based Enlighten monitoring service, and storage solutions to distributors, large
installers, OEMs and strategic partners.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 606, “Revenue Recognition”
(“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”) and applied the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of
January 1, 2018. The most significant impacts upon adoption of Topic 606 were how we account for revenue related to our
Envoy communications device and related Enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives are
recognized. The full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred and
recognized over the estimated service period.
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. We
generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers. A description of principal activities from which we generate
revenues are as follows.
•Products Delivered at a Point in Time. We sell our products to customers in accordance with the terms of the
related customer contracts. We generate revenues from sales of our solutions, which include microinverter units
and related accessories, an Envoy communications gateway and Enlighten service, communications accessories
and storage solutions to distributors, large installers, OEMs and strategic partners. Microinverter units,
microinverter accessories, and storage solutions are delivered to customers at a point in time, and we recognize
revenue for these products when we transfer control of the product to the customer, which is generally upon
shipment.
•Products Delivered Over Time. The sale of an Envoy communications gateway includes our Enlighten cloud-
based monitoring service. The full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation
and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 6 years. We also sell certain
communication accessories that contain a service performance obligation to be delivered over time. The revenue
from these products is recognized over the related service period, which is typically 5 or 12 years.
When we sell a product with more than one performance obligation, such as our IQ Combiner which includes both
hardware and Envoy, the total consideration is allocated to these performance obligations based on their relative
standalone selling prices. We previously sold Envoy communications device to certain customers under a long-term
financing arrangement. Under this financing arrangement, we net the unbilled receivables against deferred revenue.
We record certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions at the time
the related revenue is recorded.
We record upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized over the
estimated life of the asset. For contracts that have a duration of less than one year, we follow the Topic 606 practical
expedient and expense these costs when incurred. Commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service
are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue.
See Note 3. “Revenue Recognition,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to revenue recognition.
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by
reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). In cases where market exceeds net realizable value (i.e., estimated
selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value.
Market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit
margin. We determine cost on a first-in first-out basis. Certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory,
including customer demand and market conditions. Management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes
down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price, effect of new
product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Inventory
write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The carrying amounts of our cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair value are carried at
fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet
date. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, and are adjusted for
observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
Convertible Note Derivatives
In March 2020, we issued $320 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible notes due 2025.
Concurrently with the issuance of Notes due 2025, we entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge and warrant
transactions which in combination are intended to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2025.
We could not elect to issue the shares of common stock upon settlement of Notes due 2025 or convertible note hedge or
warrant transactions due to insufficient authorized share capital. As a result, the embedded conversion option and warrants
were accounted for as a derivative liabilities and convertible notes hedge as derivative asset and a gain (or loss) was
reported in other expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations to the extent the valuation changed from the
date of issuance of Notes due 2025. On May 20, 2020, at our annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved
an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the our common stock. As a
result, we are now be able to settle the Notes due 2025, convertible notes hedge and warrants through payment or
delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. Accordingly, on
May 20, 2020, the embedded derivative liability, convertible notes hedge and warrants liability were remeasured at a fair
value and were then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the second
quarter of 2020 and are no longer remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. As
of December 31, 2020, we do not have any convertible note derivatives. Note 8. “Debt” of the notes to consolidated
financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Warranty Obligations
Microinverters and Other Products Sold Through December 31, 2013
Our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units or other products that fail during the
product’s warranty term (15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for subsequent
generation microinverters). On a quarterly basis, we employ a consistent, systematic and rational methodology to assess
the adequacy of our warranty liability. This assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each
generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of the filing date. The key
estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The
key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail over time (i.e., failure
rate); (2) the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time (i.e., claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost
of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs, expected to be incurred to replace failed units
over time (i.e., replacement cost).
Estimated Failure Rates — Our Quality and Reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the
estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter. To establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of
microinverter, our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard Mean Time Between Failure (“MTFB”)
estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters, third party data collected on similar
equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed, and rigorous long
term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of
time. As units are deployed into operating environments, we continue to monitor product performance through our
Enlighten monitoring platform. It typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-user
installation. Consequently, our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months. When a
microinverter fails and is returned, we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the
underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. We then use the results of this analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative
performance data collected on those units prior to failure through Enlighten) to draw conclusions with respect to how or if
the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 68
Table of Contents
Estimated Claim Rates — Warranty claim rate estimates are based upon observed historical trends and
assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period. As the vast majority of our
microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected
by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file
claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.
Estimated Replacement Costs — Three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost:
(1) the estimated cost of replacement microinverters; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end
users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement
services for the end user. Because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods
of time (typically between 15 and 25 years, depending on the generation of product purchased), the estimated per unit cost
of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost. Estimated costs to ship
replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers. We have
a separate program that allows third-party installers to claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to
replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation. Included in our estimated
replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party
installers over the limited offering period.
In addition to the key estimates noted above, we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and
evaluate any significant differences. We may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance
trends or other qualitative factors. If actual failure rates, claim rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future
periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations. Such
increases or decreases could be material.
Fair Value Option for Microinverters and Other Products Sold Since January 1, 2014
Our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since January 1, 2014 provide us the right, but not the
requirement, to assign our warranty obligations to a third-party. Under ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (also referred to as
the “fair value option”), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes
the eligible item. We made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with
microinverters sold since January 1, 2014 at fair value. This election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the
time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
We estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for
sales prior to January 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. The expected present value
technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount. In addition to the key
estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant
to the overall fair value measurement. Such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element
and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our credit-
adjusted risk-free rate. See Note 9. “Fair Value Measurements,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included

In the normal course of business, we are subject to loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal
proceedings and claims arising out of our business as well as tariff refunds. An accrual for a loss contingency or loss
recovery is recognized when it is probable and the amount of loss or recovery can be reasonably estimated. See Note 12.

Business Combinations
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at
the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also
requires the Company to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions
with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. Accounting for business
acquisitions requires the Company to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract,
meaning that it includes other transaction components. This judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration
paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 9 years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets
are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Intangible assets with finite lives are
tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated
undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded
is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a
discounted cash flow analysis. There was no impairment of intangible assets in any of the years presented.
Income Taxes
We record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. In estimating future tax consequences,
generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation
allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as necessary. In
the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in
excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase
income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should it be determined that additional amounts of the net
deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance
will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
We operate in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities. We follow accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not”
to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating
and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately
anticipate actual outcomes.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market Risk
On March 9, 2020, we issued $320 million aggregate principal amount of our Notes due 2025, and entered into
privately-negotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, which in combination are intended to reduce the
potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2025 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from
$81.54 to $106.94 per share. For the period from March 9, 2020 through May 19, 2020, the Notes due 2025, convertible
note hedge and warrant transactions could only be settled in cash because the number of authorized and unissued shares
of our common stock that was not reserved for other purposes was less than the maximum number of underlying shares
that would be required to settle the Notes due 2025, convertible note hedge and warrants transactions. As such, the
embedded conversion option associated with the Notes due 2025, convertible notes hedge and warrants liability met the
criteria for derivative accounting, and as a result, derivative financial instruments were marked-to-market at each reporting
period. The volatile market conditions arising from
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 70
Table of Contents
the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant changes in the price of our common stock in the first half of 2020, causing
variability in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments, and materially affecting our consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Change in fair value of derivatives of $44.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 includes the charge recognized for the change in fair value of our convertible notes embedded
derivative and warrants of $47.6 million and $24.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a gain recognized for the change
in fair value of our convertible notes hedge of $28.0 million.
On May 20, 2020, we received approval at our annual meeting of stockholders to increase the authorized shares of
our common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, from 150,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares. As discussed further in
Note 11, “Debt,” of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, we reclassified the remeasured fair value of embedded derivative, warrants and convertible notes
hedge to additional paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated balance in the second quarter of 2020. As a result of this
reclassification, embedded derivative, warrants and convertible notes hedge are no longer marked to fair value at each
reporting period.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their
respective functional currency and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. More
specifically, we face foreign currency exposure primarily from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and
receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in Euros, Indian Rupee and Australian and New Zealand Dollars.
These payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions. We also face
currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our European, Indian, Australian and New Zealand operations,
including sales and marketing and research and development expenses, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have
fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period.
The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2020 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency
transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements, and we
have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.
We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We did not enter into any
foreign currency forward contracts during 2020 and 2019. Any foreign currency forward contracts entered in the future are
accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities,
and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income (expense), net, in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, and derivative financial instruments. We maintain a substantial portion of our cash balances in non-
interest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits and money market accounts. The derivative financial instruments expose us
to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We mitigate this
credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings. We are not required to pledge, and are not
entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for
trading or speculative purposes. Our net revenues are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers. We
monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary and
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated potential credit losses.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $679.4 million and $296.1 million as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, respectively, consisting of both non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits, and money market
accounts. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk, but the risk is limited due to the duration of
our short term investments. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. We do not enter into
investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our
interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to
changes in interest rates.
Our cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited as our Notes due 2025, Notes
due 2024 and Notes due 2023 have fixed interest rates of 0.25%, 1.0% and 4.0%, respectively. The fair value
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 71
Table of Contents
of the Convertible Notes may increase or decrease for various reasons, including fluctuations in the market price of our
common stock, fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions. In the year ended
December 31, 2020, we recognized a $3.0 million non-cash loss on settlement of approximately $43.9 million aggregate
principal amount of the Notes due 2024 as a result of the change in fair value. Based upon the quoted market price as of
December 31, 2020, the fair value of our Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024 was approximately $725.5 million and
$747.1 million, respectively. Notes due 2023 are not actively traded.
A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material
impact on our financial statements.
Equity Price Risk Involving Minority Interest Investment in A Non-Public Company
As of December 31, 2020, an investment of $5.0 million in a privately-held company is accounted for using the
measurement alternative method. This strategic equity investment in a third party is subject to risk of changes in market
value and could result in realized impairment losses. We generally do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market
exposure in equity investments. We monitor these investments for impairment and record reductions in the carrying values
when necessary. Circumstances that indicate an other-than-temporary decline include the valuation ascribed to the issuing
company in subsequent financing rounds, decreases in quoted market prices and declines in operations of the issuer.
There can be no assurance that our equity investment will not face risks of loss in the future.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enphase Energy, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enphase Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income
(loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts
or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Warranty Obligations – Microinverters - Refer to Notes 2, 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s warranty obligation provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product’s
warranty term of 15 to 25 years. The estimated warranty liability is developed for each generation of product and requires
management to estimate, among other factors, (1) the number of units expected to fail over time (i.e., failure rate); (2) the
number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time (i.e., claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost of
replacement units (i.e., replacement cost), all of which consider historical results, trends and the most current data
available when the financial statements are available to be issued. The Company’s warranty liability for all microinverter
units sold after January 1, 2014 is measured at fair value by applying both of the following to the liability that results from
the 3 factors discussed above: (1) compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required for a market
participant to assume the obligation and (2) a discount rate based on the Company’s credit adjusted risk free rate.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 74
Table of Contents
Given the subjectivity of estimating the projected failure rates and warranty claims, performing audit procedures to
evaluate whether the expected failure rates were appropriately determined as of December 31, 2020, required a high
degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the estimated failure rates used in determining the warranty obligation included the
following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls utilized in the review of the warranty obligation calculation, including
controls over the determination of estimated failure rates.
•We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the failure rates used as part of the
calculation of the warranty obligation by:
–Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s failure rate analysis, which include
historical claims and historical product sales, in order to evaluate the various assumptions and historical
data consisting of failure of individual components contained in its microinverters.
–Reviewing third party data compiled on similar products in order to challenge management’s assumptions
and identify supporting or contradictory evidence.
–Comparing management’s prior-year assumptions of expected failures to actual warranty claims received
during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the failure rate estimates used in
the warranty obligation recorded.
–Developing independent estimates of the future failure rates for product families by utilizing data analytics
and compared them to management assumptions.
Valuation of Convertible note embedded derivative, Convertible notes hedge and Warrants – Refer to Note 9 and
11.
Critical Audit Matter Description
On March 9, 2020, the Company issued $320 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes
due 2025 (the “Notes”). Concurrently, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible notes hedge and warrant
transactions which in combination were intended to mitigate potential dilutive effects from the conversion of the Notes.
Upon initial recognition of the Notes, the convertible notes embedded derivative, convertible note hedge and warrants met
the classification criteria for derivative accounting, and as a result, derivative financial instruments are mark-to-market at
each reporting period or until they no longer meet the classification criteria for derivative accounting. Complex models
incorporating observable and unobservable inputs were utilized to value the derivatives. The fair value of the convertible
note embedded derivative is estimated using a Binomial Lattice model and the fair value of convertible notes hedge and
warrants are estimated using Black-Scholes-Merton model.
Unlike the fair value of other financial instruments that are readily observable and therefore more easily
independently corroborated, the valuation of the three derivatives is inherently subjective and involves the use of complex
modeling tools. Auditing the fair values requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. This
includes involving our fair value specialists who possess significant quantitative and modeling expertise needed to evaluate
the appropriateness of these models and inputs.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the convertible notes embedded derivative, convertible notes hedge
and warrants included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s valuation of the convertible note embedded derivative,
convertible notes hedge and warrants.
•We evaluated management’s methodology and whether management’s assumptions were reasonable.
•We evaluated the competency and objectivity of management’s expert engaged by the Company to perform the
valuation of the convertible note embedded derivative, convertible notes hedge and warrants.
•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed independent fair value estimates and compared our
estimates to the Company’s estimates.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Enphase Energy, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Enphase Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company
and our report dated February 12, 2021 expressed as an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Description of Business
Enphase Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global energy technology company. The Company delivers smart, easy-
to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage and communication on one single platform. The Company
revolutionized the solar industry with its microinverter technology and produces a fully integrated solar-plus-storage
solution.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.”), or GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates and assumptions reflected in the financial statements include revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful
accounts, stock-based compensation, inventory valuation, accrued warranty obligations, fair value of debt derivatives and
convertible notes, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and
property and equipment, incremental borrowing rate for right-of-use assets and lease liability, probable loss recovery of
tariff refunds, legal contingencies, and tax valuation allowance. These estimates are based on information available as of
the date of the financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ materially from management’s estimates using
different assumptions or under different conditions.
The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity which
decreased demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from our customers, while also disrupting sales
channels and marketing activities for an unknown period of time and may continue to create significant uncertainty in future
operational and financial performance. The Company expects this to have negative impact on its sales and its results of
operations. In preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, the Company is
required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and
the accompanying disclosures. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with
certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, the
Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to update its estimates,
judgments or revise the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and
additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become
known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company’s
financial statements.
2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue from sales of its solutions, which include microinverter units and related
accessories, an Envoy communications gateway, the cloud-based Enlighten monitoring service, and storage solutions to
distributors, large installers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and strategic partners.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 85
Table of Contents
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 606, “Revenue
Recognition” (“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”) and applied the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not
completed as of January 1, 2018. The most significant impacts upon adoption of Topic 606 were how the Company
accounts for revenue related to its Envoy™ communications device and related Enphase Enlighten Software™, or
Enlighten, service and the timing of when certain sales incentives are recognized. The full consideration for these products
represents a single performance obligation and is deferred and recognized over the estimated service period.
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company’s
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or
services. The Company generates all of its revenues from contracts with its customers. A description of principal activities
from which the Company generates revenues follows.
•Products Delivered at a Point in Time. The Company sells its products to customers in accordance with the terms
of the related customer contracts. The Company generates revenues from sales of its solutions, which include
microinverter units and related accessories, an Envoy communications gateway and Enlighten service,
communications accessories and storage solutions to distributors, large installers, OEMs and strategic partners.
Microinverter units, microinverter accessories, and storage solutions are delivered to customers at a point in
time, and the Company recognizes revenue for these products when the Company transfers control of the
product to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.
•Products Delivered Over Time. The sale of an Envoy communications gateway includes the Company’s
Enlighten cloud-based monitoring service. The full consideration for these products represents a single
performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 6
years. The Company also sells certain communication accessories that contain a service performance obligation
to be delivered over time. The revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period, which
is typically 5 or 12 years.
When the Company sells a product with more than one performance obligation, such as the IQ Combiner which
includes both hardware and Envoy, the total consideration is allocated to these performance obligations based on their
relative standalone selling prices. The Company previously sold its Envoy communications device to certain customers
under a long-term financing arrangement. Under this financing arrangement, the Company nets the unbilled receivables
against deferred revenue.
The Company records certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions
at the time the related revenue is recorded.
The Company records upfront contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, to be capitalized and amortized
over the estimated life of the asset. For contracts that have a duration of less than one year, the Company follows the Topic
606 practical expedient and expenses these costs when incurred. Commissions related to the Company’s sale of
monitoring hardware and service are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue, which is 6 years.
See Note 3. “Revenue Recognition,” for additional information related to revenue recognition.
Cost of Revenues
The Company includes the following in cost of revenues: product costs, warranty, manufacturing personnel and
logistics costs, freight costs, inventory write-downs, hosting services costs related to the Company’s Enlighten service
offering, and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing test equipment. A description of principal activities from which
the Company recognizes cost of revenue is as follows.
• Products Delivered at a Point in Time. Cost of revenue from these products is recognized when the Company
transfers control of the product to the customer, which is generally upon shipment.
•Products Delivered Over Time. Cost of revenue from these products is recognized over the related service
period.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments, such as certificates of deposit and money market instruments
with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. For all periods presented, its cash
balances consist of amounts held in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits and money market accounts.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents cash held as certificate of deposit collateralized under a letter of credit issued to a
customer. The letter of credit was required as a performance security in a face amount equal to the aggregate purchase
price of the executed sales agreement. The letter of credit was issued per the terms of the executed sales agreement with
a customer for safe harbor prepayment and the Company had collateralized a certificate of deposit under this letter of credit
in an amount of $44.7 million, which was reflected as restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have restricted cash balance.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The carrying amounts of the Company’s
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair value are carried
at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance
sheet date. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, and are
adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
Convertible Note Derivatives
In March 2020, the Company issued $320 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible notes due 2025.
Concurrently with the issuance of Notes due 2025, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge
and warrant transactions which in combination are intended to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the
Notes due 2025. The Company could not elect to issue the shares of common stock upon settlement of Notes due 2025 or
convertible note hedge or warrant transactions due to insufficient authorized share capital. As a result, the embedded
conversion option and warrants were accounted for as a derivative liabilities and convertible notes hedge as derivative
asset and a gain (or loss) was reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations to the extent the
valuation changed from the date of issuance of Notes due 2025. On May 20, 2020, at the Company’s annual meeting of
stockholders, the stockholders approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of
authorized shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, the Company is now be able to settle the Notes due 2025,
convertible notes hedge and warrants through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common
stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. Accordingly, on May 20, 2020, the embedded derivative liability,
convertible notes hedge and warrants liability were remeasured at a fair value and were then reclassified to additional paid-
in-capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 and are no longer remeasured as
long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not
have any convertible note derivatives. See Note 11. “Debt” for additional information related to these transactions.
Accounts Receivables and Contract Assets
The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable are
recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets include deferred product costs and
commissions associated with the deferred revenue and will be amortized along with the associated revenue.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for uncollectible accounts receivable. Management
estimates anticipated credit losses from doubtful accounts based on days past due, customer specific experience,
collection history, the financial health of customers including from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other
factors. Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The following table sets forth activities in
the allowance for doubtful accounts for the periods indicated.

Write-of fs, net of recoveries (527) (1,791 ) (951)
Balance, at end of year $ 462 $ 564 $ 2,138  
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Market is current replacement cost (by purchase or by
reproduction, dependent on the type of inventory). In cases where market exceeds net realizable value (i.e., estimated
selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal), inventories are stated at net realizable value.
Market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit
margin. The Company determines cost on a first-in first-out basis. Management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis
and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand, anticipated sales price,
effect of new product introductions, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other
factors. Inventory write-downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market.
Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes amounts paid to acquire or
construct the asset as well as any expenditure that substantially adds to the value of or significantly extends the useful life
of an existing asset. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or expected useful life of the improvements.
Internal-use software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis
over its estimated useful life. Costs associated with internally developed software are expensed until the point at which the
project has reached the development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are
capitalized only to the extent that they provide additional functionality. Software maintenance and training costs are
expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The capitalization of internal-use software requires judgment in
determining when a project has reached the development stage and the period over which the Company expects to benefit
from the use of that software.
The Company capitalizes implementation costs related to cloud computing (i.e. hosting) arrangements that are
accounted for as a service contract that meets the accounting requirement for capitalization as such implementation costs
were incurred to develop or utilize internal-use software hosted by a third party vendor. The capitalized implementation
costs are recorded as part of “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheet and is amortized over the length of the
service contract.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 88
Table of Contents
Property, plant and equipment, including internal-use software, and capitalized implementation costs related to cloud
computing arrangements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the
asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The
Company recorded asset impairment charges for specific assets that were no longer in use of approximately zero, $1.1
million and $1.6 million for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no events or changes in
circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of remaining assets is not recoverable.
Business Combinations
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at
the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also
requires the Company to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions
with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. Accounting for business
acquisitions requires the Company to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract,
meaning that it includes other transaction components. This judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration
paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction.
Goodwill
Goodwill results from the purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets recorded in
connection with a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for potential impairment at least annually
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which the Company has
determined to be the same as the entity as a whole (entity level). The Company first performs qualitative assessment to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after
assessing the qualitative factors, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less
than its carrying value, an impairment analysis will be performed.
Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and
market capitalization and Company-specific events. The Company determined, after performing a qualitative review of its
reporting unit, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Accordingly,
there was no indication of impairment in the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018 and no quantitative goodwill impairment test
was performed.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 9 years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets
are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Intangible assets with finite lives are
tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated
undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded
is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a
discounted cash flow analysis. There was no impairment of intangible assets in any of the years presented.
Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and include
payments received in advance of performance obligations under the contract and are realized when the associated
revenue is recognized under the contract.

Warranty Obligations
Microinverters and Other Products Sold Through December 31, 2013
The Company’s warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units or other products that fail during
the product’s warranty term (typically 15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for
subsequent generation microinverters). On a quarterly basis, the Company employs a consistent, systematic and rational
methodology to assess the adequacy of its warranty liability. This assessment includes updating all key estimates and
assumptions for each generation of product, based on historical results, trends and the most current data available as of
the filing date. The key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management
on a quarterly basis. The key estimates used by the Company to estimate its warranty liability are: (1) the number of units
expected to fail over time (i.e., failure rate); (2) the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time
(i.e., claim rate); and (3) the per unit cost of replacement units, including outbound shipping and limited labor costs,
expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time (i.e., replacement cost).
Estimated Failure Rates — The Company’s Quality and Reliability department has primary responsibility to
determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter. To establish initial failure rate estimates for each
generation of microinverter, the Company’s quality engineers use a combination of industry standard Mean Time Between
Failure (“MTBF”) estimates for individual components contained in its microinverters, third party data collected on similar
equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which the Company’s microinverters are installed, and
rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short
period of time. As units are deployed into operating environments, the Company continues to monitor product performance
through its Enlighten monitoring platform. It typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of end-
user installation. Consequently, the Company’s ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine
months. When a microinverter fails and is returned, the Company performs diagnostic root cause failure analysis to
understand and isolate the underlying mechanism(s) causing the failure. The Company then uses the results of this
analysis (combined with the actual, cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through Enlighten)
to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanism(s) will impact the remaining units deployed in
the installed base.
Estimated Claim Rates — Warranty claim rate estimates are based upon observed historical trends and
assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period. As the vast majority of the Company’s
microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications, the Company believes that warranty claim rates will
be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because the Company expects that subsequent
homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters.
Estimated Replacement Costs — Three factors are considered in the Company’s analysis of estimated
replacement cost: (1) the estimated cost of replacement microinverters; (2) the estimated cost to ship replacement
microinverters to end users; and (3) the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers
performing replacement services for the end user. Because the Company’s warranty provides for the replacement of
defective microinverters over long periods of time (between 15 and 25 years, depending on the generation of product
purchased), the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated
replacement cost. Estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable, market-based shipping costs paid
by the Company to third party freight carriers. The Company has a separate program that allows third-party installers to
claim fixed-dollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the
date of original installation. Included in the Company’s estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixed-
dollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period.
In addition to the key estimates noted above, the Company also compares actual warranty results to expected results
and evaluates any significant differences. Management may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based
on performance trends or other qualitative factors. If actual failure rates, claim rates, or replacement costs differ from the
Company’s estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in
the Company’s warranty obligations. Such increases or decreases could be material.

Fair Value Option for Microinverters and Other Products Sold Since January 1, 2014
The Company’s warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since January 1, 2014 provide the Company the
right, but not the requirement, to assign its warranty obligations to a third-party. Under ASC 825, “Financial Instruments”
(also referred to as “fair value option”), an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it
first recognizes the eligible item. The Company made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations
associated with microinverters sold since January 1, 2014 at fair value. This election was made to reflect the underlying
economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years.
The Company estimates the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same
manner as for sales prior to January 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. The
expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount.
In addition to the key estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, the Company used certain inputs that
are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Such additional assumptions included
compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and
a discount rate based on the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free rate. See Note 9. “Fair Value Measurements,” for
additional information.
Warranty obligations initially recorded at fair value at the time of sale will be subsequently re-measured to fair value
at each reporting date. In addition, the fair value of the liability will be accreted over the corresponding term of the warranty
of up to 25 years using the interest method.
Warranty for Other Products
The Company offers a 5‑year warranty for its Envoy communications gateway and a 10‑year warranty on its AC
Battery storage solution. The warranties provide the Company with the right, but not the obligation, to assign its warranty
obligations to a third-party. As such, warranties for Envoy and AC Battery storage solution products are accounted for
under the fair value method of accounting.
Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal
proceedings and claims arising out of its business as well as tariff refunds. An accrual for a loss contingency or loss
recovery is recognized when it is probable and the amount of loss or recovery can be reasonably estimated.
Research and Development Costs
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense consists
primarily of product development personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, other
professional costs and allocated facilities costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
Share-based payments are required to be recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations based
on their fair values and the estimated number of shares expected to vest. The Company measures stock-based
compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including stock options made to employees and directors,
based on the estimated fair values on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options granted is estimated using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units granted is determined based on the price of
the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of non-market‑based performance stock units granted is
determined based on the date of grant or when achievement of performance is probable. The fair value of market‑based
performance stock units granted is determined using a Monte‑Carlo model based on the date of grant or when
achievement of performance is probable.

Table of Contents
Stock-based compensation for stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation for performance stock units (“PSUs”) without market
conditions is recognized when the performance condition is probable of being achieved, and then on a graded basis over
the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation for PSUs with market conditions is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period. Additionally, the Company estimates its forfeiture rate annually based on historical
experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease assets represent the
Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to
make lease payments over the lease term.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments
discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs
incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company combines the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and
liabilities.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company and most of its subsidiaries use their respective local currency as their functional currency.
Accordingly, foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period.
Aggregate exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of foreign assets and liabilities are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Foreign subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as
their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period.
In addition, transactions that are denominated in non-functional currency are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at
the end of the period. Exchange gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are
included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
are carried at their historical values.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) consists of two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income
(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholders’
equity but are excluded from net income (loss). The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign
currency translation adjustments for all periods presented.
Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. In estimating future tax
consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are
considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to
be realized.
The Company assesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as
necessary. In the event the Company determines that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize deferred tax
assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax
asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should it be determined that additional
amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset
valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.

The Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities. The Company
follows accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is
“more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The Company considers
many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and
which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a
Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,” to reduce diversity in practice in accounting for the costs of
implementing cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts. ASU 2018-15 allows entities to apply the guidance
in the ASC 350-40, “Intangibles–Goodwill and Other–Internal-Use Software,” to determine which implementation costs are
eligible to be capitalized as assets in a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service contract. ASU 2018-15 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted, including adoption in any interim period. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all
implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively and are required to make certain disclosures in
the interim and annual period of adoption. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2020 on a
prospective basis and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for
financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with a current
expected credit loss (CECL) model which will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. On January 1, 2020, the
Company on a prospective basis adopted Topic 326, the measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL model is
applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable. The adoption of this guidance did
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
In August 2020, the FASB issued Account Standard Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and
Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which
reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion
features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost
as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the
effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net
income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The
treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The
amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is
permitted. The Company is evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard.

Amortization of developed technology, patents and licensed technology is recorded to sales and marketing expense.
The developed technology acquired from the Company’s acquisition of SunPower Corporation’s (“SunPower”) microinverter
business in August 2018 was embedded in the microinverters that SunPower sold to its customers. The Company does not
actively use the developed technology acquired from SunPower and holds the developed technology to prevent others from
using it. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the developed technology as a defensive intangible asset and amortizes
the associated value over a period of six years from the date of acquisition.
The master supply agreement (“MSA”) entered into with SunPower in August 2018 provides the Company with the
exclusive right to supply SunPower with module level power electronics for a period of five years, with options for renewals.
The exclusivity arrangement extends throughout the term of the MSA, which comprises all of the expected cash flows from
the customer relationship intangible asset, and was a condition to, and was an essential part of the acquisition of
SunPower’s microinverter business by the Company. As the original $23.1 million fair value ascribed to the customer
relationship intangible asset represents payments to a customer, the Company amortizes the value of the customer
relationship intangible asset as a reduction to revenue using a pattern of economic benefit method over a useful life of nine
years. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company signed an amendment to the MSA which increased the period of
exclusive right to supply by another three months, and the associated incremental non-cash $3.3 million fair value of equity
is added to the customer relationship intangible asset will follow the same amortization pattern.

Changes in Estimates
On a quarterly basis, the Company uses the best and most complete underlying information available, following a
consistent, systematic and rational methodology to determine its warranty obligations. The Company considers all available
evidence to assess the reasonableness of all key assumptions underlying its estimated warranty obligations for each
generation of microinverter. The changes in estimates discussed below resulted from consideration of new or additional
information becoming available and subsequent developments. Changes in estimates included in the table above were
comprised of the following:
2020
In 2020, the Company recorded a $8.8 million increase to warranty expense based on continuing analysis of field
performance data and diagnostic root-cause failure analysis primarily relating to its prior generation products. The
Company also recorded additional warranty expense of $1.2 million related to unit costs for prior generation microinverter
replacement driven by tariffs and labor reimbursement costs expected to be paid to third party installers performing
replacement services.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 98
Table of Contents
2019
In 2019, the Company recorded a $5.5 million increase to warranty expense related to cost increases primarily driven
by increased U.S. tariffs announced during 2019 for its products manufactured in China. The Company also recorded
additional warranty expense of $3.1 million based on continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic root-
cause failure analysis primarily relating to its second and third generation products, partially offset by improved failure rates
for its IQ7 series.
2018
In 2018, the Company recorded a $0.9 million increase to warranty expense related to cost increases primarily for
backwards compatibility cables, supply constrained inventory components as well as tariffs. The Company also recorded
additional warranty expense of $3.3 million based on continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic root-
cause failure analysis primarily relating to its second and third generation products. In addition, the Company recorded an
increase of $2.1 million related to increased estimated claim rates and an increase to warranty expense of $0.2 million for
labor reimbursement costs expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services. These increases
were partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction to warranty expense, presented as “Other” in the table above, related to
changes in the discount rates for fair value accounting.
9.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.
The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset’s or liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is
based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to
measure fair value:
•Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company
is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an
active market, valuation of such assets or liabilities do not entail a significant degree of judgment.
•Level 2 - Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant
inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
•Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
Level 1. The Company considers all highly liquid investments, such as certificates of deposit and money market
instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. For all periods
presented, its cash balances consist of amounts held in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits and money
market accounts and are within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices for
identical instruments in active markets. As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents balance includes money
market funds of $654.7 million.

Level 2.
Convertible Notes due 2025 Derivatives.
On March 9, 2020, the Company issued $320 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes
due 2025 (the “Notes due 2025”). Concurrently with the issuance of Notes due 2025, the Company entered into privately-
negotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which in combination are intended to reduce the potential
dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2025. On May 20, 2020, at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders,
the stockholders approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
the Company’s common stock. As a result, the Company satisfied the share reservation condition (as defined in the
relevant indenture associated with the Notes due 2025). The Company will now be able to settle the Notes due 2025,
convertible notes hedge and warrants through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common
stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. Accordingly, on May 20, 2020, the embedded derivative liability,
convertible notes hedge and warrants liability were remeasured at a fair value of $116.3 million, $117.1 million and $96.4
million, respectively, and were then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet in
the second quarter of 2020 and are no longer remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity
classification. See Note 11. “Debt” for additional information related to these transactions.
The fair value of the Convertible notes embedded derivative was estimated using Binomial Lattice model and the fair
value of Convertible notes hedge and Warrants liability was estimated using Black-Scholes-Merton model. The significant
observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, and assumptions used in the models to calculate the fair value of the
derivatives include the Company’s common stock price, exercise price of the derivatives, risk-free interest rate, volatility,
annual coupon rate and remaining contractual term.
Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024.
The Company carries the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024 (as defined below) at face value less unamortized
discount and issuance costs on its consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2024
was $725.5 million and $747.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 based on the closing trading prices per $100
principal amount as of the last day of trading for the period. The Company considers the fair value of the Notes due 2025
and Notes due 2024 to be a Level 2 measurement as they are not actively traded.
Level 3.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair value.
In December 2020, the Company invested approximately $5.0 million in a privately-held company without readily
determinable market value, which is included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has
elected the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. The
Company did not record an impairment charge on its investment during the year ended December 31, 2020, as no events
or changes in circumstances were identified which could result as an indicator for impairment. Further, there were no
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer during the year
ended December 31, 2020. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are classified within Level 3 in the
fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value based on valuation methods using a combination of
observable and unobservable inputs including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds,
volatility in the results of operations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the securities the Company holds.

The Company estimates the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same
manner as for sales prior to January 1, 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result. The
expected present value technique, an income approach, converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount.
In addition to the key estimates of failure rates, claim rates and replacement costs, the Company used certain Level 3
inputs which are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Such additional assumptions included
a discount rate based on the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free rate and compensation comprised of a profit element and
risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation.
The following table provides information regarding changes in nonfinancial liabilities related to the Company’s

Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value
measurement of the Company’s liabilities designated as Level 3 are as follows:

Sensitivity of Level 3 Inputs - Warranty Obligations
Each of the significant unobservable inputs is independent of the other. The profit element and risk premium are
estimated based on requirements of a third-party participant willing to assume the Company’s warranty obligations. The
credit‑adjusted risk‑free rate (“discount rate”) is determined by reference to the Company’s own credit standing at the fair
value measurement date. Increasing the profit element and risk premium input by 100 basis points would result in a
$0.2 million increase to the liability. Decreasing the profit element and risk premium by 100 basis points would result in a
$0.2 million reduction of the liability. Increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points would result in a $1.4 million reduction
of the liability. Decreasing the discount rate by 100 basis points would result in a $1.6 million increase to the liability.

Convertible Senior Notes due 2025
On March 9, 2020, the Company issued $320.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2025. The Notes
due 2025 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate of 0.25% per year, payable semi-annually
on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 2020. The Notes due 2025 are governed by an
indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes due 2025 will mature on
March 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted at the option of the holders. The Company may
not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes. The Notes due 2025 may be
converted, under certain circumstances as described below, based on an initial conversion rate of 12.2637 shares of
common stock per $1,000 principal amount (which represents an initial conversion price of $81.54 per share). The
conversion rate for the Notes due 2025 will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but
will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change
(as defined in the relevant indenture), the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a
number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental
change. The Company received approximately $313.0 million in net proceeds, after deducting the initial purchasers’
discount, from the issuance of the Notes due 2025.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 104
Table of Contents
The Notes due 2025 may be converted prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding
September 1, 2024, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under the following
circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2020 (and only
during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days
(whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day
of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable
trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement
period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each
trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s
common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
On and after September 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding
the maturity date of March 1, 2025, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), holders may require the Company to
repurchase all or a portion of their Notes due 2025 for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to
be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
As of December 31, 2020, the sale price of the Company’s common stock was greater than or equal to $106.00
(130% of the notes conversion price) for at least 20 trading days (whether consecutive or not) during a period
of 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-ended December 31, 2020. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, the
Notes due 2025 are convertible at the holders’ option through March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company classified the net
carrying amount of the Notes due 2025 of $255.0 million as Debt, current on the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2020.
For the period from March 9, 2020, the issuance date, through May 19, 2020, the number of authorized and unissued
shares of the Company’s common stock that are not reserved for other purposes was less than the maximum number of
underlying shares that would be required to settle the Notes due 2025 into equity. Accordingly, unless and until the
Company had a number of authorized shares that were not issued or reserved for any other purpose that equaled or
exceeded the maximum number of underlying shares (“share reservation condition”), the Company would be required to
pay to the converting holder in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of notes being converted solely in cash in an
amount equal to the sum of the daily conversion values for each of the 20 consecutive trading days during the related
observation period. However, following satisfaction of the share reservation condition, the Company could settle
conversions of notes through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or
a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election.
In accounting for the issuance of the Notes due 2025, on March 9, 2020, the conversion option of the Notes due
2025 was deemed an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation from the Notes due 2025 (“host contract”) and separate
accounting as an embedded derivative liability, as a result of the Company not having the necessary number of authorized
but unissued shares of its common stock available to settle the conversion option of the Notes due 2025 in shares. The
proceeds from the Notes due 2025 were first allocated to the embedded derivative liability and the remaining proceeds
were then allocated to the host contract. On March 9, 2020, the carrying amount of the embedded derivative liability of
$68.7 million representing the conversion option was determined using the Binomial Lattice model and the remaining
$251.3 million was allocated to the host contract. The difference between the principal amount of the Notes due 2025 and
the fair value of the host contract (the “debt discount”) is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method
over the term of the Notes due 2025.

On May 20, 2020, at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved an amendment to
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s
common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, from 150,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares (the “Amendment”). The
Amendment became effective upon filing with the Secretary of State of Delaware on May 20, 2020. As a result, the
Company satisfied the share reservation condition. The Company may now settle the Notes due 2025 and warrants issued
in conjunction with the Notes due 2025 through payment or delivery, as the case may be, of cash, shares of its common
stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election. Accordingly, on May 20, 2020,
the embedded derivative liability was remeasured at a fair value of $116.3 million and was then reclassified to additional
paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 and is no longer remeasured as
long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The Company recorded the change in the fair value of
the embedded derivative in other expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended
December 31, 2020.
The Company separated the Notes due 2025 into liability and equity components, this resulted in a tax basis
difference associated with the liability component that represents a temporary difference. The Company recognized the
deferred taxes of $0.2 million for the tax effect of that temporary difference as an adjustment to the equity component
included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.

Debt issuance costs for the issuance of the Notes due 2025 were approximately $7.6 million, consisting of initial
purchasers' discount and other issuance costs. In accounting for the transaction costs, the Company allocated the total
amount incurred to the Notes due 2025 host contract. Transaction costs were recorded as debt issuance cost (presented
as contra debt in the consolidated balance sheet) and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes
due 2025.

Notes due 2025 Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2025, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note
hedge transactions pursuant to which the Company has the option to purchase a total of approximately 3.9 million shares
of its common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments), which is the same number of shares initially issuable upon
conversion of the notes, at a price of $81.54 per share, which is the initial conversion price of the Notes due 2025. The total
cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $89.1 million. The convertible note hedge transactions
are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes due
2025 and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted
notes, as the case may be. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had not purchased any shares under the convertible
note hedge transactions.
Additionally, the Company separately entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions (the “Warrants”) whereby
the Company sold warrants to acquire approximately 3.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to anti-
dilution adjustments) at an initial strike price of $106.94 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of
approximately $71.6 million from the sale of the Warrants. If the market value per share of the Company’s common stock,
as measured under the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the
Company’s earnings per share, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the Warrants in cash.
Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the Warrants are intended to reduce potential
dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2025 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $81.54 to
$106.94 per share. The Warrants are only exercisable on the applicable expiration dates in accordance with the
agreements relating to each of the Warrants. Subject to the other terms of the Warrants, the first expiration date applicable
to the Warrants is June 1, 2025, and the final expiration date applicable to the Warrants is September 23, 2025. As of
December 31, 2020, the Warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding.
For the period from March 9, 2020, the issuance date of the convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions,
through May 19, 2020, the number of authorized and unissued shares of the Company’s common stock that are not
reserved for other purposes was less than the maximum number of underlying shares that will be required to settle the
Notes due 2025 through the delivery of shares of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the convertibles note hedge
and the warrant transactions could only be settled on net cash settlement basis. As a result the convertible note hedge and
the warrants transaction were classified as a Convertible notes hedge asset and Warrants liability, respectively, in the
consolidated balance sheet and the change in fair value of derivatives was included in other expense, net in the
consolidated statement of operations.
On May 20, 2020, at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved the Amendment,
and as a result, the Convertible notes hedge asset and Warrants liabilities were remeasured at a fair value of $117.1 million
and $96.4 million, respectively, and were then reclassified to additional paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 and is no longer remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions
for equity classification. The change in the fair value of the Convertible notes hedge asset and Warrants liability were
recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Convertible Senior Notes due 2024
On June 5, 2019, the Company issued $132.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.0% convertible senior notes
due 2024 (the “Notes due 2024”). The Notes due 2024 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual
rate of 1.0% per year, payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2019. The
Notes due 2024 are governed by an indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The
Notes due 2024 will mature on June 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted at the option of the
holders. The Company may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes.
The Notes due 2024 may be converted, under certain circumstances as described below, based on an initial conversion
rate of 48.7781 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount (which represents an initial conversion price of
$20.5010 per share). The conversion rate for the Notes due 2024 will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a
make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), the Company will, in certain circumstances,
increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with
such make-whole fundamental change. The Company received approximately $128.0 million in net proceeds, after
deducting the initial purchasers’ discount, from the issuance of the Notes due 2024.
The Notes due 2024 may be converted on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding December 1, 2023, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under any of the
following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30,
2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last
trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $26.6513 (130% of the conversion
price) on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period
(the “measurement period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the relevant indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of
notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of
the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified
corporate events. On and after December 1, 2023 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day
immediately preceding the maturity date of June 1, 2024, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the
foregoing circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the relevant indenture), holders may
require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes due 2024 for cash at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental
change repurchase date.
As of December 31, 2020, the sale price of the Company’s common stock was greater than or equal to $26.6513
(130% of the notes conversion price) for at least 20 trading days (whether consecutive or not) during a period
of 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter-ended December 31, 2020. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, the
Notes due 2024 are convertible at the holders’ option through March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company classified the net
carrying amount of the Notes due 2024 of $69.0 million as Debt, current on the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2020. From January 1, 2021 through February 12, 2021, the Company has received the request for
conversion of approximately $61.5 million in principal amount of Notes due 2024, of which the Company has elected to
settle the aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 in a combination of cash and any excess in shares of the
Company’s common stock in accordance with the applicable indenture. Such conversion will be settled in March 2021.
In accounting for the issuance of the Notes due 2024, on June 5, 2019, the Company separated the Notes due 2024
into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component of approximately $95.6 million was
calculated by using a discount rate of 7.75%, which was the Company’s borrowing rate on the date of the issuance of the
notes for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component of
approximately $36.4 million, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability
component from the par value of the Notes due 2024. The equity component of the Notes due 2024 is included in
additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the
conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the Notes due 2024 and the liability
component (the “debt discount”) is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the
Notes due 2024.
Enphase Energy , Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 108
Table of Contents
The Company separated the Notes due 2024 into liability and equity components, this resulted in a tax basis
difference associated with the liability component that represents a temporary difference. The Company recognized the
deferred taxes of $0.3 million for the tax effect of that temporary difference as an adjustment to the equity component
included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.
Debt issuance costs for the issuance of the Notes due 2024 were approximately $4.6 million, consisting of initial
purchasers' discount and other issuance costs. In accounting for the transaction costs, the Company allocated the total
amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the Notes due
2024. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were approximately $3.3 million, were recorded as debt
issuance cost (presented as contra debt in the consolidated balance sheet) and are being amortized to interest expense
over the term of the Notes due 2024. The transaction costs attributable to the equity component were
approximately $1.3 million and were netted with the equity component in stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2020
and 2019, the unamortized deferred issuance cost for the Notes due 2024 was $1.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively,
on the consolidated balance sheets.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, holders converted $43.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes due
2024, the principal amount of which was repaid in cash. Of the $43.9 million in aggregate principal amount, $38.5 million in
aggregate principal amount was settled pursuant to an exchange agreement entered into in December 2020 with certain
holders of Notes due 2024. The Company also issued 1.9 million shares of its common stock to the holders with an
aggregate fair value of $301.0 million, representing the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the Notes due
2024, which were fully offset by shares received from the Company’s exercise of the associated note hedging
arrangements discussed below. The total amount of $43.9 million paid to partially settle the Notes due 2024 was allocated
between the liability and equity components of the amount extinguished by determining the fair value of the liability
component immediately prior to the notes settlement and allocating that portion of the conversion price to the liability
component in the amount of $37.2 million. The residual of the conversion price of $6.7 million was allocated to the equity
component of the Notes due 2024 as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. The fair value of the notes settlement was
calculated using a discount rate of 5.75%, representing an estimate of the Company's borrowing rate at the date of
repurchase with a remaining expected life of approximately 3.6 years. As part of the settlement, the Company wrote-off the
$8.9 million unamortized debt discount and $0.8 million debt issuance cost apportioned to the principal amount of Notes
due 2024 settled. The Company also recorded a loss on partial settlement of the Notes due 2024 of $3.0 million in Other
expense, net, representing the difference between the consideration attributed to the liability component and the sum of the
net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance costs. As of December 31, 2020, $88.1
million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 remains outstanding.
The following table presents the total amount of interest cost recognized in the statement of operations relating to the
Notes due 2024:

The effective interest rate on the liability component Notes due 2024 was 7.75% for the year ended December 31,
2020, which remains unchanged from the date of issuance. The remaining unamortized debt discount was $17.6 million
and $32.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and will be amortized over approximately
3.4 years from December 31, 2020.

In connection with the offering of the Notes due 2024, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note
hedge transactions pursuant to which the Company has the option to purchase a total of approximately 6.4 million shares
of its common stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments), which is the same number of shares initially issuable upon
conversion of the notes, at a price of $20.5010 per share, which is the initial conversion price of the Notes due 2024. The
total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was approximately $36.3 million. The convertible note hedge
transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of
the Notes due 2024 and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of
converted notes, as the case may be.
As a result of the conversion request received from the holders of $43.9 million in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes due 2024 in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company exercised the 2.1 million shares representing proportionate
number of the convertible note hedge transaction and received 1.9 million shares on net basis of its common stock during
the period. As of December 31, 2020, option to purchase a total of approximately 4.3 million shares remain outstanding.
Additionally, the Company separately entered into privately-negotiated warrant transactions (the “Warrants”) whereby
the Company sold warrants to acquire approximately 6.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to anti-
dilution adjustments) at an initial strike price of $25.2320 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of
approximately $29.8 million from the sale of the Warrants. If the market value per share of the Company’s common stock,
as measured under the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the
Company’s earnings per share, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the Warrants in cash.
Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the Warrants are intended to reduce potential
dilution from the conversion of the Notes due 2024 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $20.5010 to
$25.2320 per share. The Warrants are only exercisable on the applicable expiration dates in accordance with the Warrants.
Subject to the other terms of the Warrants, the first expiration date applicable to the Warrants is September 1, 2024, and
the final expiration date applicable to the Warrants is April 22, 2025.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into partial unwind agreements to unwind number of
warrants exercisable under the note hedge arrangements and to issue approximately 2.1 million Warrants on a net basis,
resulting in a net issuance of approximately 1.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in connection with the
exchange of the Notes due 2024. As of December 31, 2020, Warrants exercisable to purchase a total of approximately
4.3 million shares remains outstanding.
Given that the transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Notes due 2024 hedge and the warrants transactions
are recorded in stockholders’ equity, and they are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting
period.
Convertible Senior Notes due 2023
In August 2018, the Company sold $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% convertible senior notes due
2023 (the “Notes due 2023”) in a private placement. On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into separately and privately
negotiated transactions with certain holders of the Notes due 2023 resulting in the repurchase and exchange, as of June 5,
2019, of $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes in consideration for the issuance of 10,801,080 shares of
common stock and separate cash payments totaling $6.0 million. As of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
$5.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2023 remains outstanding.

Table of Contents
The remaining outstanding Notes due 2023 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 4.0% per
year, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The Notes due 2023 are governed by an indenture
between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The remaining outstanding Notes due 2023 will
mature on August 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted at the option of the holders. The
Company may not redeem the remaining Notes due 2023 prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for
such notes. The remaining Notes due 2023 are convertible, at a holder’s election, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount,
into shares of the Company’s common stock based on the applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate for such
notes is 180.0180 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to an initial
conversion price of approximately $5.56 per share). The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price are
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.
Holders of the remaining Notes due 2023 who convert their notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change
(as defined in the applicable indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate.
Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the remaining Notes due 2023 may require the Company to
repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest, including any additional interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Holders may convert all or any
portion of their Notes due 2023 at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding the maturity date, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount.

Sale of Long-Term Financing Receivables
The Company entered into an agreement with a third party in the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell certain current and
future receivables at a discount. In December 2017, the third party made an initial purchase of receivables that resulted in
net proceeds to the Company of $2.8 million. This transaction was recorded as debt on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, and the debt balance was relieved in January 2019 as the underlying receivables were settled. During the
year ended December 31, 2018, the third party made three additional purchases of receivables that resulted in total net
proceeds to the Company of $5.6 million. These transactions were recorded as debt on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, and the total associated debt balance will be relieved by September 2021 as the underlying receivables
are settled. As of December 31, 2020, the total sale of long-term financing receivable recorded as debt of $1.9 million
remains outstanding.

Litigation
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of its operations that have not
been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the
Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s business, results of
operations, financial position and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. As of
February 12, 2021, the Company is not currently a party to any matters that the management expects will have an adverse
material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Contingencies
On March 26, 2020, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (the “USTR”) announced certain exclusion
requests related to tariffs on Chinese imported microinverter products that fit the dimensions and weight limits within a
Section 301 Tariff exclusion under U.S. note 20(ss)(40) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of
the United States (the “Tariff Exclusion”). The Tariff Exclusion applies to covered products under the China Section 301
Tariff Actions (“Section 301 Tariffs”) taken by the USTR exported from China to the United States from September 24, 2018
until August 7, 2020. Accordingly, the Company has sought refunds totaling approximately $38.9 million plus approximately
$0.6 million accrued interest on tariffs previously paid from September 24, 2018 to March 31, 2020 for certain
microinverters that qualify for the Tariff Exclusion. The refund request was subject to review and approval by the U.S.
Customs and Border Protection; therefore, the Company assessed the probable loss recovery in the year ended December
31, 2020 is equal to the approved refund requests available to us prior to issuance of the financial statements on February
12, 2021.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had received $24.8 million of tariff refunds and accrued for the remaining
$14.7 million tariff refunds that were approved, however, not yet received on or before December 31, 2020. For the year
ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $38.9 million as a reduction to cost of revenues in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations as the approved refunds relate to paid tariffs previously recorded to cost of
revenues, therefore, the Company recorded the corresponding approved tariff refunds as credits to cost of revenues in the
current period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded the $0.6 million accrued interest as interest
income in the consolidated statement of operations. The tariff refund receivable of $14.7 million is recorded as a reduction
of accounts payable to Flex Ltd. and affiliates (“Flex”), the Company’s manufacturing partner and the importer of record
who will first receive the tariff refunds, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The
Company is unable to predict the timing of receipt of the $14.7 million approved.
The Tariff Exclusion expired on August 7, 2020 and those microinverter products now are subject to tariffs. The
Company continues to pay Section 301 Tariffs on its storage and communication products and other accessories imported
from China which are not subject to the Tariff Exclusion.
13.    SALE OF COMMON STOCK
In February 2018, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an investor pursuant to which
the Company, in a private placement, issued and sold to the investor approximately 9.5 million shares of the Company’s
common stock at a price per share of $2.10, for gross proceeds of approximately $20.0 million.
14.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Description of Equity Incentive Plans
2006 Plan
Under the Company’s 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), equity awards granted generally vest over a
4‑year period from the date of grant with a contractual term of up to 10 years. As of December 31, 2020, there were less
than 0.1 million shares of options outstanding under the 2006 Plan. No further stock options or other stock awards may be
granted under the 2006 Plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2011 Plan
Under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”), the Company could initially issue up to 2,643,171 shares of
its common stock pursuant to stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARS”), restricted stock awards (“RSA”), RSUs,
PSUs, and other forms of equity compensation, or collectively, stock awards, all of which may be granted to employees,
including officers, and to non-employee directors and consultants. Options granted under the 2011 Plan before August 1,
2012 generally expire 10 years after the grant date and options granted thereafter generally expire 7 years after the grant
date. Equity awards granted under the 2011 Plan generally vest over a 4-year period from the date of grant based on
continued employment. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized for issuance under the 2011
Plan automatically increases on each January 1 by 4.5% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock
outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or such lesser number of shares of common stock as
determined by the board of directors. As of December 31, 2020, 8,940,388 shares remained available for issuance
pursuant to future grants under the 2011 Plan. On January 1, 2021, the shares available for issuance under the 2011 Plan
automatically increased by 5,803,296 shares.
2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) became effective immediately upon the execution and delivery of
the underwriting agreement for the Company’s initial public offering on March 29, 2012. The ESPP authorized the issuance
of 669,603 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. The number of
shares of common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase, on each January 1, by a lesser of
(i) 330,396 shares of the Company’s common stock or (ii) 1.0% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common
stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, as determined by the Company’s board of directors. At
the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 18, 2017 the Company’s stockholders approved a one-time amendment
to the Company’s ESPP to increase the aggregate number of shares available for purchase by 400,000 shares and to
increase the annual automatic minimum increase in shares reserved for issuance from 330,396 to 700,000 shares effective
January 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, 1,288,887 shares remained available for future issuance under the ESPP. On
January 1, 2021, the shares available for issuance under the ESPP automatically increased by 700,000 shares.
The ESPP is implemented by concurrent offering periods and each offering period may contain up to four interim
purchase periods. In general, offering periods consist of the 24-month periods commencing on each May 15 and
November 15 of a calendar year.
Generally, all full-time employees in Australia, France, India, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United
States, including executive officers, are eligible to participate in the ESPP. The ESPP permits eligible employees to
purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of the employee’s total
compensation subject to certain limits. Stock may be purchased under the plan at a price equal to 85% of the fair market
value of the Company’s stock on either the date of purchase or the first day of an offering period, whichever is lower. A
two‑year look-back feature in the Company’s ESPP causes an offering period to reset if the fair value of the Company’s
common stock on a purchase date is less than that on the initial offering date for that offering period. The reset feature,
when triggered, will be accounted for as a modification to the original offering, resulting in additional expense to be
recognized over the 24-month period of the new offering. During any calendar year, participants may not purchase shares
of common stock having a value greater than $25,000, based on the fair market value per share of the common stock at
the beginning of an offering period.

Valuation of Equity Awards
Stock Options
The fair value of each option granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions:
•Expected term - The expected term of the option awards represents the period of time between the grant date of
the option awards and the date the option awards are either exercised, converted or canceled, including an
estimate for those option awards still outstanding. The Company used the simplified method, as permitted by the
SEC for companies with a limited history of stock option exercise activity, to determine the expected term for its
option grants.
•Expected volatility - The expected volatility was calculated based on the Company’s historical stock prices,
supplemented as necessary with historical volatility of the common stock of several peer companies with
characteristics similar to those of the Company.
•Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant and with a maturity that approximated the Company’s expected term.
•Dividend yield - The dividend yield was based on the Company’s dividend history and the anticipated dividend
payout over its expected term.
The following table presents the weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted for the periods presented
and the assumptions used to estimate those values using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Dividend yield —% —% —%
Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units (“RSU”) awards granted is based upon the closing price of the
Company’s stock price on the date of grant.
Performance Stock Units
The fair value of the Company’s non-market performance stock units (“PSU”) awards granted was based upon the
closing price of the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of awards of the Company’s PSU awards
containing market conditions was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model based upon the terms of the
conditions, the expected volatility of the underlying security, and other relevant factors.

The Company's accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the
realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets. Assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
several factors, including the likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income in relevant jurisdictions during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company's management forecasts taxable income
by considering all available positive and negative evidence including its history of operating income or losses and its
financial plans and estimates which are used to manage the business. These assumptions require significant judgment
about future taxable income. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future
periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.
The Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal and California income tax purposes of approximately
$113.7 million and $87.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 2036 and 2029, respectively.
The Company has approximately $18.2 million of federal research credit and $12.6 million of state research credit
carryforwards. The federal credits begin to expire in 2026 and the state credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual
limitations due to the “change in ownership” provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
The Company has completed a Section 382 analysis through December 31, 2020, which indicated no such change has
occurred through December 31, 2020.
The accounting for uncertain tax positions prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
Company is required to recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more-likely-than-
not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recorded a net charge for
unrecognized tax benefits in 2020 of $1.8 million.
The Company does not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible the total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease over the next year. The unrecognized tax benefits may increase or
change during the next year for items that arise in the ordinary course of business.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the years presented is as follows (in
thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2020 2019 2018
Unrecognized tax benefits—at beginning of year $ 6,589  $ 6,325  $ 6,106  
Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken in prior years — (370) — 
Increases in balances related to tax positions taken in current year 2,006  771 329 
Lapses in statutes of limitations (174) (137) (110)
Unrecognized tax benefits—at end of year $ 8,421  $ 6,589  $ 6,325  
The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the benefit from (provision
for) income taxes. As of years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the total amount of gross interest and penalties
accrued in each year was immaterial. Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are
not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company’s interest and penalty expense recognized
in 2020, 2019 and 2018 in the consolidated statements of operations was immaterial.
The Company’s tax returns continue to remain effectively subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the
years 2006 through 2020 and by California state authorities for the years 2006 through 2020 due to use and carryovers of
net operating losses and credits.
16.    CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company is potentially subject to financial instrument concentration of credit risk through its cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high quality institutions and
performs periodic evaluations of their relative credit standing.
Accounts receivable can be potentially exposed to a concentration of credit risk with its major customers. As of
December 31, 2020, amounts due from one customer represented approximately 36% of the total accounts receivable
balance. As of December 31, 2019, amounts due from three customers represented 34%, 14% and 11% of the total
accounts receivable balance.
In 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 29% of total net revenues. In 2019, two customers accounted for
approximately 21% and 12% of total net revenues. In 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 19% of total net
revenues.
17.    NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed in a similar
manner, but it also includes the effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period, when dilutive. Potential
common shares include Stock Options, RSUs, PSUs, shares to be purchased under the Company’s ESPP, the Notes due
2023, the Notes due 2024, Warrants issued in conjunction with the Notes due 2024, and from May 20, 2020 to the end of
the reporting period, the Notes due 2025 and Warrants issued in conjunction with the Notes due 2025. See Note 11. “Debt”
for additional information.
The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive common shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the
treasury stock method for stock options, RSUs, PSUs, Notes due 2024, warrants issued in conjunction with the Notes due
2024, Notes due 2025, warrants issued in conjunction with the Notes due 2025 and shares to be purchased under the
ESPP, and by application of the if-converted method for the Notes due 2023. To the extent these potential common shares
are antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share.

conjunction with the Notes due 2024. Certain common stock issuable under stock options, RSUs, PSUs, Notes due 2025
and warrants issued in conjunction with the Notes due 2025 have been omitted from the diluted net income per share

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes the dilutive effect of stock options, RSUs,
PSUs, shares to be purchased under the ESPP, the Notes due 2023 and Notes due 2024. Certain common stock issuable
under stock options, RSUs, PSUs and warrants issued in conjunction with the Notes due 2024 have been omitted from the
diluted net income per share calculation because including such shares would have been antidilutive.
Since the Company has the intent and ability to settle the aggregate principal amount of the Notes due 2024 and
Notes due 2025 in cash and any excess in shares of the Company’s common stock, the Company uses the treasury stock
method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable.
In order to compute the dilutive effect, the number of shares included in the denominator of diluted net income per share is
determined by dividing the conversion spread value of the “in-the-money” Notes due 2024 and Notes due 2025 by the
Company’s average share price during the period and including the resulting share amount in the diluted net income per
share denominator. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on net income per share of common stock when the
average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $20.50 per share
and $81.54 per share for the Notes due 2024 and Notes due 2025, respectively.
18.    SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer reviews
financial information presented on a consolidated basis. The Company has one business activity, which entails the design,
development, manufacture and sale of solutions for the solar photovoltaic industry. There are no segment managers who
are held accountable for operations, operating results or plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level.
Accordingly, management has determined that the Company has a single operating and reportable segment.

The Company sells products to SunPower under the August 2018 MSA. As of December 31, 2019, SunPower via its
wholly owned subsidiary, held 6.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Revenue recognized under the MSA for
the year ended December 31, 2019 was $70.9 million, net of amortization of the customer relationship intangible asset (see
Note 6. “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”). As of December 31, 2019, the Company had accounts receivable of
$15.9 million from SunPower. As of December 31, 2019, the Company received $5.2 million as a safe harbor prepayment
from SunPower in the fourth quarter of 2019 for product delivered in the first quarter of 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, SunPower via its wholly owned subsidiary held 3.5 million shares of the Company’s
common stock which is less than 5% of the Company’s common stock outstanding and is no longer a considered a related
party.
20.    ACQUISITION
On August 9, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of SunPower’s microinverter business pursuant to an
APA by which the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of SunPower relating to the research and development
and manufacturing of microinverters. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, the
total purchase price was allocated to the preliminary net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their
preliminary fair values on the acquisition date.
In conjunction with the APA, the Company entered into an MSA with SunPower. Pursuant to the terms of the MSA,
the Company becomes the exclusive supplier of MLPEs for SunPower’s residential business in the U.S. for a period of five
years. The resulting customer relationship intangible is accounted for as a distinct transaction from the acquired business.
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was approximately $57.3 million, which consisted of
the following (in thousands):
Cash consideration $ 25,000  
Common stock issued 32,319  
Total $ 57,319  
The fair value of the Company’s 7.5 million shares of common stock issued, valued at $32.3 million, was determined
based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the acquisition date, less a discount of 14% to 30%
(depending on the year) for lack of marketability as the shares issued are subject to a restriction that limits their trade or
transfer with a lock-up period of six months and restrictions on the number of shares that can be transferred by SunPower
in each six-month period following the lock-up period.
The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
the acquisition date (in thousands):
Intangible assets $ 36,200  
Goodwill 21,119  
Net assets acquired $ 57,319  
The excess of the consideration paid over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
represents the goodwill resulting from the acquisition. The $21.1 million of goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to
the benefits the Company expects to derive from enhanced scale and efficiency to better serve its markets. Goodwill is
expected to be deductible over the next 15 years for income tax purposes.
The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired are based on management’s
estimates and assumptions. The fair values of assets acquired are preliminary and may be subject to change within the
measurement period as the fair value assessments are finalized.

The following table shows the fair value of the separately identifiable intangible assets at the time of acquisition and
the period over which each intangible asset will be amortized:
Preliminary Fair
Value Useful Life
(In thousands) (Years)
Developed technology $ 13,100  6
Customer relationship 23,100  9
Total identifiable intangible assets $ 36,200  
The developed technology acquired is embedded in the microinverters that SunPower sells to its customers. The
Company already has developed microinverter technology and the Company will supply its microinverters to SunPower
through the term of the MSA. The Company does not intend to actively use the developed technology acquired from
SunPower but does plan to hold the developed technology to prevent others from using it. Therefore, the Company will
account for the developed technology as a defensive intangible asset. The Company expects to realize the benefits of the
developed technology over the period of time in which the Company will supply microinverters to SunPower. The Company
does expect changes in microinverter technology during the life of the customer relationship with SunPower and expects to
benefit from preventing competitors’ access to the technology over a period of six years, therefore, the Company will
amortize the value of the developed technology intangible asset over a period of six years.
The MSA was negotiated together with the APA and provides the Company with the exclusive right to supply
SunPower with MLPEs for a period of five years, with options for renewals. The exclusivity arrangement extends
throughout the term of the MSA, which comprises all of the expected cash flows from the customer relationship intangible
asset, and was a condition to, and was an essential part of the acquisition of the microinverter business by the Company.
As the fair value ascribed to the customer relationship intangible asset represents payments to a customer, the Company
will amortize the value of the customer relationship intangible asset as a reduction to revenue using a pattern of economic
benefit method over a useful life of nine years.
The table below shows estimated fair values of the assets acquired funded by cash and issuance of common stock
at the acquisition date:

Total consideration $ 25,000  $ 32,319  $ 57,319  100 %
The Company allocated $10.0 million of the $25.0 million paid of the cash purchase price to cash flows from
operating activities and the remaining $15.0 million to cash used in investing activities in the consolidated statements of
cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018. The allocation was based on the valuation of the customer relationship
relative to the overall consideration. In addition, the Company disclosed $19.2 million from issuance of common stock and
$15.0 million of cash purchase price paid for the developed technology and goodwill as investing activities in the
consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018.
During 2018, total acquisition-related costs were approximately $0.8 million, which were included in general and
administrative expenses.
The Company determined it is impractical to include such pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the
historical financial information for the SunPower microinverter business as the business was part of SunPower and did not
have discrete financial information prior to the acquisition. Inclusion of such information would require the Company to
make estimates and assumptions regarding the acquired business historical financial results that the Company believes
may ultimately prove inaccurate.

21.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In January 2021, the Company invested $25.0 million in cash in a privately-held company. The investment does not
require consolidation into the Company’s financial statements because the privately-held company is not a variable interest
entity and the Company does not hold a majority voting interest.
On January 25, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the voting interest of Sofdesk Inc.
(“Sofdesk”), a privately-held company. Sofdesk provides design software for residential solar installers and roofing
companies. As part of the consideration, the Company paid approximately $32.0 million in cash on January 25, 2021. The
Company is currently in the process of completing the preliminary purchase price allocation, which will be included in the
Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.
On February 8, 2021, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire the solar design services business of
DIN Engineering Services LLP (“DIN”). DIN provides proposal drawings and permit plan sets for residential solar installers
in North America. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an evaluation required by the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
2020 based on criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of
December 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. The Company’s independent registered public
accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting, which
appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent quarter ended
December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that
most of our employees are continuing to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor and
assess the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and
operating effectiveness.
Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and fraud.
Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected.
