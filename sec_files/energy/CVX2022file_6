under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken
or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional
legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or
future litigation; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to
close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government
mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on
scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; material reductions in corporate
liquidity and access to debt markets; the receipt of required Board authorizations to implement capital allocation strategies,
including future stock repurchase programs and dividend payments; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally
accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and
hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 20
through 25 in this report. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse
effects on forward-looking statements.

Item 1. Business
General Development of Business
Summary Description of Chevron
Chevron Corporation, a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative,
financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals
operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural
gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major
international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream
operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants;
manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor
equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and
lubricant additives.
A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1.
Overview of Petroleum Industry
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products
and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply.
Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a
significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and
how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their
profits directly.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical
needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global
petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream
business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing,
transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels,
lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.
Operating Environment
Refer to pages 32 through 40 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.
Chevron’s Strategic Direction
Chevron’s strategy is to leverage its strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. The company’s primary objective
is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the
company’s strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream,
the company’s strategy is to be the leading downstream and chemicals company that delivers on customer needs. Chevron aims to
lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen,
carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions
are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets and customer
relationships.
Information about the company is available on the company’s website at www.chevron.com. Information contained on the
company’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company’s website soon after such
reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the
SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.*
________________________________________________________
 Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005,
ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us”
and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of
Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience
only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Human Capital Management
Chevron invests in its employees and culture, with the objective of developing the full potential of its workforce to deliver energy
solutions and drive human progress. The Chevron Way explains the company’s beliefs, vision, purpose and values. It guides how
the company’s employees work and establishes a common understanding of culture and aspirations. Chevron hires, develops, and
strives to retain a diverse workforce of high-performing talent, and fosters a culture that values diversity, inclusion and employee
engagement. Chevron leadership is accountable for the company’s investment in people and the company’s culture. This includes
reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, retention, diversity and inclusion, and employee
engagement.
The following table summarizes the number of Chevron employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of
December 31, 2021.

 Includes employees where gender data was not collected or employee chose not to disclose gender.
Hiring, Development and Retention
The company’s approach to attracting, developing and retaining a diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in a
long-term employment model that fosters an environment of personal growth and engagement. Chevron’s philosophy is to offer
compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise
performance. Chevron recruits new employees in part through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition,
the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills.
Chevron’s learning and development programs are designed to help employees achieve their full potential by building technical,
operating and leadership capabilities at all levels to produce energy safely, reliably and efficiently. Chevron’s leadership regularly
reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to meet the needs of our evolving
business. For example, the company delivers learning experiences digitally to empower its employees, in any location, to develop,
maintain and enhance critical skills. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline,
identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides
oversight of CEO and executive succession planning.
Management routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, which includes executives, all levels of management,
and the majority of its regular employee population. The annual voluntary attrition for this population was 4.5 percent, which is in
line with rates over a five-year comparison period. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under
enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company’s
commitment to employee development, its long-term employment model, competitive pay and benefits, and its culture.
Diversity and Inclusion
Chevron believes innovative solutions to the most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and experiences come
together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the values of diversity and inclusion through recruitment and talent
development, equitable selection processes, community partnerships and supplier diversity. Examples of1

initiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the company’s MARC (Men Advocating Real Change) program
launched in 2017 in partnership with the non-profit organization Catalyst to facilitate discussions on gender equity in the
workplace, and selection processes that reinforce the importance of diverse selection teams and candidate slates. In addition,
Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests)
and a Chairman’s Inclusion Council, which provides the employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the
executive leadership team to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce Chevron’s values of diversity and
inclusion.
Employee Engagement
Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company’s values, purpose and strategies.
Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company’s culture; recent surveys indicate high employee
engagement. In 2021, the company increased survey frequency to better understand employee sentiment throughout the year,
including focused efforts to gain insights into employee well-being. Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its
employees. Chevron’s safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise stop-work authority without
repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. Chevron developed new safeguards and operating standards and
updated existing protocols to adjust for the ever-changing conditions of the pandemic, including a return to the workplace strategy,
with paced, condition-based stages. The company also announced a hybrid work model based on employee feedback and learnings
from the pandemic, which will allow certain employees the flexibility to combine in-office and remote work. Additionally, the
company offers long-standing employee support programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees
with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate
Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a
broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns.

Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas
The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2021 and 2020 by the company and its affiliates.
Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 3.099 million barrels per day in 2021 was up approximately 1 percent from 2020.
Additional production from the Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) acquisition and lower production curtailments were partially offset by
asset sale related decreases of 80,000 barrels per day, expiration of the Rokan concession in Indonesia, unfavorable entitlement
effects, and normal field declines. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 38 for a detailed discussion of the
factors explaining the changes in production for crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, synthetic oil and natural gas, and refer to
Table V for information on annual production by geographical region.

Production Outlook
The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2022 to be flat to down three percent compared to 2021
assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of asset sales that may close in 2022. Excluding
contract expirations and 2022 asset sales, 2022 production is expected to increase by two to five percent compared to 2021. This
estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, as described beginning on page 35. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing
Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 10, for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and
natural gas development projects.
Average Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production
Refer to Table IV for the company’s average sales price per barrel of crude (including crude oil and condensate) and natural gas
liquids and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced, and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for 2021,
2020 and 2019.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver approximately 16 million barrels of crude oil and
759 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2022 through 2024. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts
through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These
commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms.
Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to third
parties from 2022 through 2024 from operations in Australia and Israel. The Australia sales contracts contain variable pricing
formulas that generally reference the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
delivery. The sales contracts for Israel contain formulas that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation, Brent-
linked or other, over the life of the contract. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas
Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2021 key upstream
activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, beginning on page 38, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net
production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1.
The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on
production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent
discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects
requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.
United States
Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado, and the Gulf of Mexico.
Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 8. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be
found in the table on page 7.
Chevron is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin with a production outlook of more than one million barrels of net oil
equivalent production per day by 2025. The company’s advantaged portfolio of development areas in west Texas and southeast
New Mexico is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations.
Chevron has implemented a Permian factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that
are subsequently completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. Top tier drilling and completions performance has
enabled year-over-year capital expenditure efficiency improvement and cycle time reduction generating higher returns throughout
Chevron’s Permian portfolio. Chevron’s Permian operations have also demonstrated continual progress on its lower carbon and
water goals, consistently ranking among the best Permian operators for methane emissions intensity, routine flaring, and water
handling (utilizing 99 percent brackish or recycled sources). In 2021, Chevron’s net daily unconventional production in the Permian
Basin averaged 284,000 barrels of crude oil, 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 148,000 barrels of NGLs. Conventional
production averaged 10,000 barrels of crude oil, 39 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of NGLs per day.
Chevron holds mature assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas that produced 29,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2021.
In 2021, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California with a net daily oil equivalent production of 96,000
barrels. Chevron completed front-end engineering and design (FEED) in second quarter 2021 on a carbon capture project for
emissions reduction from the gas turbines in one of our California co-generation facilities. This project leverages two innovative
technologies—carbon dioxide concentration and carbon capture—and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. A
final investment decision for this project is expected in third quarter 2022, with anticipated start-up in 2024. Chevron is also
progressing the installation of a 20MWh battery at the solar power plant in the Lost Hills field with start-up expected in third
quarter 2022.
In Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin is primarily focused on Chevron’s Mustang and Wells Ranch areas
where the company’s comprehensive drilling plans allow for efficient resource development. Chevron’s net daily production in the
DJ Basin averaged 56,000 barrels of crude oil, 302 million cubic feet of natural gas and 36,000 barrels of NGLs during 2021.
Chevron also has operations in Colorado’s Piceance Basin as well as acreage positions in Wyoming and Utah.
During 2021, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 180,000 barrels of crude oil, 102 million cubic feet of natural gas
and 12,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production
activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields.
The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two
fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company
operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production
from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields
progressed in 2021. The St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project includes two new production wells, three injector wells, and topsides
water injection equipment at the St. Malo Field. Two oil production wells were placed online, and first injection is expected in
2023. Additional Jack development in 2021 consisted
10
of a single well tieback and related subsea infrastructure installation. The Stage 4 multiphase subsea pump project replaced the
single-phase subsea pumps in both the Jack and St. Malo fields. Multiphase pump modules were completed and received in 2021
with installation expected to commence in 2022. Proved reserves have been recognized for the multiphase subsea pump project.
The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years.
The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. Project execution continued in
2021 on the Mad Dog 2 Project with installation of the floating production platform in November 2021. First oil is expected in the
second half of 2022. Proved reserves have been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project.

Downstream
Refining Operations
At the end of 2021, the company had a refining network capable of processing 1.8 million barrels of crude oil per day. Operable
capacity at December 31, 2021, and daily refinery inputs for 2019 through 2021 for the company and affiliate refineries, are
summarized in the table below.
Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization was 82 percent in 2021 and 76 percent in 2020. At the U.S. refineries, crude oil
distillation capacity utilization averaged 83 percent in 2021, compared with 73 percent in 2020. Chevron processes both imported
and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 60 percent and 59 percent of
Chevron’s U.S. refinery inputs in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In the United States, the company continued work on projects aimed at improving refinery flexibility and reliability. At the El
Segundo Refinery in California, production of renewable fuels from bio-feedstocks was achieved in third quarter 2021. At the
refinery in Salt Lake City, Utah, the alkylation retrofit project reached start-up in April 2021. The Pasadena Refinery enables
processing of greater amounts of Permian light crude oil and provides integration with Chevron’s Gulf Coast Pascagoula,
Mississippi refinery and Houston Blend Center.
Outside the United States, the company has three large refineries in Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. The Singapore Refining
Company (SRC), a 50 percent-owned joint venture, has a total capacity of 290,000 barrels of crude per day and manufactures a
wide range of petroleum products, including higher-quality gasoline that meets stricter emission standards. Refinery upgrades have
enabled SRC to produce higher-quality gasoline that meets stricter emission standards. The 50 percent-owned, GS Caltex (GSC)
operated, Yeosu Refinery in South Korea remains one of the world’s largest refineries with a total crude capacity of 800,000 barrels
per day. The company’s 60.6 percent-owned refinery in Map Ta Phut, Thailand, continues to supply high-quality petroleum
products through the Caltex brand into regional markets.

Chevron markets commercial aviation fuel to 69 airports worldwide. The company also markets an extensive line of lubricant and
coolant products under the product names Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa, Rando, Clarity and Taro in the United States and
worldwide under the three brands: Chevron, Texaco and Caltex.
Chemicals Operations
Chevron Oronite Company develops, manufactures and markets performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels and conducts
research and development for additive component and blended packages. At the end of 2021, the company manufactured, blended
or conducted research at 11 locations around the world. Commercial production from the lubricant additive blending and shipping
plant in Ningbo, China was achieved in second quarter 2021.
Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). CPChem produces olefins,
polyolefins and alpha olefins and is a supplier of aromatics and polyethylene pipe, in addition to participating in the specialty
chemical and specialty plastics markets. At the end of 2021, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 28 manufacturing
facilities and two research and development centers around the world.
In addition to continued efforts to debottleneck existing ethylene and polyethylene units, CPChem advanced projects at existing
facilities to expand its normal alpha olefins business. In May 2021, CPChem announced plans for a second world-scale unit at Old
Ocean, Texas to produce on-purpose 1-hexene with expected capacity of 266,000 metric tons per year. In December 2021, CPChem
made final investment decision on a new C3 splitter unit at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas that is expected to have the
capacity to produce 1 billion pounds of propylene annually. Target start-up for both units is 2023.1

CPChem holds a 51 percent interest in the U.S. Gulf Coast II Petrochemical Project (USGC II) and a 30 percent interest in the Ras
Laffan Petrochemical Project (RLPP) in Qatar. CPChem continued engineering on RLPP as well as continued work toward FID on
USGC II.
Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GSC, the company’s 50 percent-owned
affiliate. GSC manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of
products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GSC also produces polypropylene, which is used to make automotive and
home appliance parts, food packaging, laboratory equipment and textiles.
First production from the olefins mixed-feed cracker and associated polyethylene unit within the existing refining and
petrochemical facilities in Yeosu, South Korea was achieved in June 2021, ahead of schedule and under budget.    
Renewable Fuels
The company continued to advance lower carbon actions in the downstream business, particularly through development of
renewable fuels, which include renewable natural gas (RNG), renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable base oils
and lubricants. The company has two partnerships to produce and market dairy biomethane, with CalBioGas and Brightmark RNG
Holdings. In fourth quarter 2021, Brightmark RNG Holdings delivered first RNG. Separately, all CalBioGas farms are now online.
In June 2021, the company announced its first branded compressed natural gas (CNG) site as part of its plan to have more than 30
CNG sites in California supplied with RNG by 2025. In October 2021, the company closed its acquisition of an equity interest in
American Natural Gas LLC (now Beyond6, LLC) and its network of 60 CNG retail sites, in order to meet customers’ needs beyond
California.
Progress has continued at the company’s El Segundo Refinery in California to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation
fuel through the co-processing of bio-feedstock. In third quarter 2021, the refinery began co-processing about 2,000 barrels per day
of bio-feedstock, producing renewable diesel at a diesel hydrotreating unit as well as a batch of sustainable aviation fuel at a fluid
catalytic cracking unit. In 2022, the company expects to convert the same diesel hydrotreater at the El Segundo refinery to 100
percent renewable capability, increasing capacity to 10,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel.
The company continues development of renewable base oil through our patented technology and majority ownership in Novvi and
has made progress integrating this renewable base oil into Chevron’s lubricant product lines. Chevron developed Havoline Pro-RS,
with lifecycle emissions that are 35 percent lower than those of conventional motor oil of equal viscosity. In November 2021, the
company made this renewable based lubricant available to professional installers in the United States and Canada, and it is
expected to be available to U.S. consumers in early 2022.
Transportation
Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the
United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and
indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. Chevron acquired all of the outstanding common units of Noble
Midstream Partners LP not already owned by Chevron or any of its affiliates in May 2021.
Refer to pages 13 and 14 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline
Consortium.
Shipping The company’s marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional
crude tankers, product carriers and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstock in support
of the company’s global upstream and downstream businesses. In December 2021, Chevron joined the Sea Cargo Charter, a
benchmark initiative for responsible shipping activities, transparent greenhouse gas reporting, and improved decision making in
line with the United Nations’ decarbonization targets.
Other Businesses
Chevron Technical Center The company’s technical center provides expertise to drive the application of technology, initiatives to
transform Chevron’s digital future, and innovative breakthrough technologies to support the future of energy. The organization
conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The

18
facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety.
Chevron’s information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and
network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevron’s global operations and business processes.
Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) leverages innovative companies and technologies to strengthen Chevron’s core operations
and identifies new opportunities with the potential to enhance the way Chevron produces and delivers affordable, reliable, and ever-
cleaner energy. CTV has more than two decades of venture investing, with eight funds that have supported more than 100 startups
and worked with more than 200 co-investors. In addition to the company’s own managed funds, Chevron also is a limited partner in
the following funds: the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) Climate Investments fund, which targets the decarbonization of oil
and gas, industry and commercial transportation; the Emerald Ventures fund, which targets energy, water, industrial IT and
advanced materials; and the HX Venture fund, which targets Houston, Texas high-growth start-up companies.
Chevron continued its participation as a member of OGCI, a global collaboration focused on the industry’s efforts to take actions to
accelerate and participate in a lower carbon future. In 2021, the Climate Investments fund made additional investments and
deployed or piloted portfolio technologies with member companies, helping enable methane and CO emissions reductions, as well
as advancing carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies.
Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes; therefore, the ultimate technical or commercial successes of these investments are not certain. Refer to Note 27 Other
Financial Information for quantification of the company’s research and development expenses.
Chevron New Energies The new energies organization was formed in 2021 and is designed to advance the company’s strategy by
bringing together dedicated resources focused on growing new lower carbon businesses that have the potential to scale. Its initial
focus will include commercialization opportunities in hydrogen, CCUS, and carbon offsets. These businesses are expected to
support the company’s efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and are also expected to become high-growth opportunities
with the potential to generate accretive returns.
Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to
minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and
processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments.
Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak
occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various
aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation.
To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives,
including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which
operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to
expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of
control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project,
which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different
regions of the world.
The company is committed to lowering the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, in addition to complying with
the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 20 through 25 for
further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business.
Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 49 for additional
information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company’s 2021 environmental expenditures. Refer

Item 1A. Risk Factors
As a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company’s results of
operations and financial condition.
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS
Impacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material
adverse effect on Chevron’s financial and operating results The economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the
COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have been and continue to be far reaching. While the oil and gas
industry witnessed a substantial recovery of commodity prices and demand for products during 2021, there continues to be
uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future
periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what
duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are
beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any further resurgences of
the COVID-19 virus and its variants, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the
economy and economic activity, including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products; the ability of our
affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses
and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand
and, correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the
pandemic subsides; and Chevron’s ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products.
The company’s suppliers continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor
has been strained. This strain on the financial health of the company’s suppliers could put pressure on the company’s financial
results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance. In-country conditions, including potential future
waves of the COVID-19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics
and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity.
In light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is
currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the
company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period. In addition, the
unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in
hindsight.
In addition, the continuation or further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in
this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations
and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks.
Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history
of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be
influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas
or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related
damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID-
19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, geopolitical risks, the pace of energy transition, and governmental regulations and policies
regarding the development of oil and gas reserves. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its
business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.
Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure
programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired.
Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the
associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s
credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize
anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such
downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in new business lines such as the lower carbon
businesses associated with our Chevron New Energies
20
organization. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets
subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on
the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon
which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends.
The scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an
extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for
future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of
projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling
success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule;
and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.
The company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban
areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or
human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather,
wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level rise, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system
failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which may be
impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural
environment.
Chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan
for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm
severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake
severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.
Cyberattacks targeting Chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact
on the company’s business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron’s cybersecurity and
privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee
malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated
in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud
providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data
privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain
unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. Although Chevron devotes significant
resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external
third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its
business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and
infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions
in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including
without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third
parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident.
Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and
proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or
software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems that can materially impact the
company’s business. Regardless of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or
regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s
business and results of operations.
The company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron’s results
depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry.
The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its
operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and
result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life,
environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a
system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance
21
mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and
policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the
company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.
The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does
not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a
significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured
for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations
that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen
liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have
a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS
Chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces,
transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially
hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered
pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and
control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or
government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions
about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures
or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s
causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.
For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 16 Litigation.
Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business The
company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic
environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to
increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose
additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations,
trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s
competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may
threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or
strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations.
Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by
management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with
sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate which, depending upon
their scope, could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results in certain countries. In addition, litigation or
changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development
or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that
impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability.
Legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose Chevron to additional tax liabilities Changes in tax laws and regulations
around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company’s control. Chevron’s taxes in the
jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or
regulations. Furthermore, Chevron’s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world. There is no assurance
that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that Chevron has reflected on the company’s tax returns, in which case
interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial
condition.
For information concerning the company’s tax liabilities, see Note 17 Taxes and Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments.

Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts related to
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce
demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products, resulting in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of
operations and financial condition Chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of
international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and
methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that
aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. The company is currently
subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union
Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations. Further, the Paris
Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries in which we operate may adopt additional policies to
meet their Paris Agreement goals. Globally, multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing
laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms, such as a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade
program, or performance standards, or to indirectly advance reduction of GHG emissions through restrictive permitting, trade
tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, increased GHG reporting and climate-related disclosure requirements, or tax
advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy, fuel sources or lower-carbon technologies. GHG emissions
that may be directly regulated through such efforts include, among others, those associated with the company’s exploration and
production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of
crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the
transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and related products; and customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products.
Indirect regulation of GHG emissions could include, among other things, bans or restrictions on technologies or products that use
the company’s hydrocarbon products. Many of these actions, as well as customers’ preferences and use of the company’s products
or substitute products, and actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations, are beyond the
company’s control. 
Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG emissions and climate change-related legislation,
regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector, or render the extraction of the company’s
hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other
government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in
increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for
hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy
sources; make the company’s products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources;
impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. The
ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government and private
actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will
depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required,
the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance
instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to
which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive
marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and
government actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with
certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws
and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions.
Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to
ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, increasing societal, investor and legislative pressure on
companies to address ESG matters, and potential customer use of substitutes to Chevron’s products may result in increased costs,
reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our
stock price and access to capital markets, and damage to our reputation. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may
result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation, or threats
thereof, against the company. For instance, we have received investigative requests and demands from the U.S. Congress for
information relating to climate change, methane leak
23
detection and repair, and other topics, and further requests and/or demands are possible. At this time, Chevron cannot predict the
ultimate impact any Congressional or other investigations may have on the company.
In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings
processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and climate-related risks. Such
ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders, including but not
limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of
fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Unfavorable
ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment
toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and
our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG matters, including biodiversity, waste and
water, may increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment.
Our aspirations, targets and disclosures related to ESG matters expose us to numerous risks, including risks to our reputation
and stock price In October 2021, Chevron announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Upstream by
2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for zero routine flaring, upstream carbon intensity,
portfolio carbon intensity, and refining carbon intensity. These aspirations, targets or objectives reflect our current plans and
aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these
goals and objectives present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could
have a material negative impact, including on our reputation and stock price.
Our ability to achieve any aspiration, target or objective, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, our new lower carbon
strategy outlined in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 32 through
34, and any lower carbon new energy businesses, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples
of such risks include: (1) the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy
sources; (2) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon
credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements
affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and
removals; (7) customers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products; and (8) actions taken by the
company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations.
The standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our
selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and
may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period. In addition, our processes and controls may not always align with
evolving voluntary standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may
differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals
or reported progress in achieving such goals.
Achievement of or efforts to achieve aspirations and targets such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives may
increase costs, require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company’s business plans and financial results, potentially
resulting in the reduction to the economic end-of-life of certain assets, an impairment of the associated net book value, among other
material adverse impacts. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations and targets or to satisfy various
reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have a negative impact on investor sentiment, ratings
outcomes for evaluating the company’s approach to ESG matters, stock price, and cost of capital and expose us to government
enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts.
GENERAL RISK FACTORS
Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and
regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s
best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may
occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
24
Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and
investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including
litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates
or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market
conditions, the pace of energy transition, or changes in the company’s outlook on commodity prices, could affect reported amounts
of assets, liabilities or expenses.

believes would result in $1.0 million or more of monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, under federal, state and local
laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of
protecting the environment.
As previously disclosed, the refinery in Pasadena, Texas acquired by Chevron on May 1, 2019 (Pasadena Refining System, Inc. and
PRSI Trading LLC) has multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) that were issued by the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality related to air emissions at the refinery. The Pasadena refinery is currently negotiating a resolution of the
NOVs with the Texas Attorney General. Resolution of these alleged violations is expected to result in the payment of a civil penalty
of $1.0 million or more.
As previously disclosed, the California Department of Conservation, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM)
(previously known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground
Injection Control program that took effect April 1, 2019. Subsequent to that date, CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron
related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil Field in Kern County, California. An October 2, 2019 CalGEM order seeks a civil
penalty of approximately $2.7 million. Chevron has filed an appeal of this order. Chevron is currently in discussions with CalGEM
to explore a global settlement to resolve the order and all past and present seeps in the Cymric Field, which would increase the
amount of penalty paid.
As previously disclosed, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency notified
Noble Energy, Inc., Noble Midstream Partners LP and Noble Midstream Services, LLC of potential penalties for alleged Clean
Water Act violations at two facilities in Weld County, Colorado relating to a 2014 flood event and requirements for a Spill
Prevention and Countermeasures Plan and Facility Response Plan. The parties have negotiated a resolution of these issues with the
agencies, which was approved by the U.S. District Court, District of Colorado on September 28, 2021. Resolution of these alleged
violations resulted in the payment of a civil penalty of $1.0 million on October 26, 2021.

Business Environment and Outlook
Chevron Corporation is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina,
Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Mexico,
Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea,
Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
The company’s objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment.
Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting
the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the
company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of
sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the
company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other
measures intended to improve financial performance.
Governments, companies, communities, and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change,
recognizing that individuals and society benefit from access to affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy. International initiatives
and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various
stages of adoption and implementation. These policies, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris
Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix, and the relative
economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of these policies can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of,
technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable
carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability and other standards, evolving regulatory requirements
affecting ESG standards or other disclosures, and evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission
reductions and removals. Beyond the legislative and regulatory landscape, ever changing customer and consumer behavior can also
influence energy demand by affecting preferences and use of the company’s products or competitors’ products, now and in the
future.1,2

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Chevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to taking
actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the need for energy that supports society.
Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and
planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also
factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range
effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as renewable fuel penetration and energy efficiency standards, and demand
response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-
related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon
capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations
enacted or customer and consumer preference in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it, and market conditions. As discussed
in more detail below, the company has announced planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments.
Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy
system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply. The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources
to meet customers’ demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company
will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer preferences.
Chevron aims to grow its traditional oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow lower carbon
businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target
sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s
capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company’s traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending
upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.
In 2021, Chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy:
2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for Upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions
on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with
multiple stakeholders, continuing progress on commercially viable technology, government policy, successful negotiations for
carbon capture and storage and nature-based projects, availability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market, and
granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.
2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1, direct emissions, and Scope 2, indirect
emissions from imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted 2028
reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a:
•40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-
equivalent (COe/boe),
•26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg COe/boe,
•53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg COe/boe, and
•66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg COe/boe.
The company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris Agreement
entered into force, and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris Agreement stocktakes. We
believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company’s progress toward its net zero aspiration.
2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure
of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron’s entire business. This metric encompasses the company’s Upstream
and Downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and
steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company’s PCI target is 71 grams (g)
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoules (MJ) by 2028, a greater than five percent reduction from 2016.
Planned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 The company increased its planned capital spend to approximately $10
billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of
its traditional oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and
carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate setting additional capital spending targets as the company2

progresses toward its 2050 Upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and further grows its lower carbon business
lines.
Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 25 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate
change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business, including the risks impacting Chevron’s lower carbon strategy and its
aspirations, targets and plans.
Response to Market Conditions and COVID-19 Commodity prices and demand for most of our products have largely recovered
from the impacts of COVID-19 in 2020. However, some countries face a resurgence of the virus and its variants (e.g., Delta,
Omicron) that could impact demand for some of our products (e.g., jet fuel), workforce availability, timing of project start-ups and
materials movement and pose a risk to our business and future financial results.
Chevron’s operations have continued with a combination of on-site and at-home work, while monitoring local vaccine and
transmission rates. In refining, the company continued to take steps to maximize diesel and motor gasoline production, given the
decline in jet fuel demand.
In TCO, progress continued on FGP/WPMP. Staffing is at targeted levels and at the end of December 2021, over 90 percent of the
TCO workforce on-site was fully vaccinated.
The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is mainly due
to mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate
jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected
results in future periods. Note 17 Taxes provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.
Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A,
on pages 20 through 25 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.
The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value
and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value
growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.
The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the
implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into
account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.
Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:
Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and
natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with
global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions
imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and
human causes beyond the company’s control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof
that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s
production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and
holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.
The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to
find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition,
and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.
The company is actively managing its schedule of work, contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively
manage costs and ensure supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of operational goals. Third party costs for capital,
exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to:
severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, the general level of
inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry’s material and service
providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company’s costs reflect
changes in market trends.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Prices for goods and services in various sectors have risen over the past year. A key factor behind this trend is the accelerated
demand for goods and transportation as companies restock materials and expand working inventories as a hedge against future
disruptions. Shifts in the labor market continue to create issues for companies seeking to fill positions. Geographic mismatches
between skills required and available labor, reductions in the overall labor supply, and perceptions of working conditions have
resulted in tight labor markets.
As U.S. and international drilling activity continues to accelerate, continued upward market pressure is expected for oil and gas
industry inputs (such as rigs and well services). The pace of economic growth and shifting spending patterns may lead to more
cross-industry competition for resources, which could impact the cost of certain non-oil and gas industry goods and services.
The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry
Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $71 per barrel for the full-year 2021, compared to $42 in 2020. As of mid-
February 2022, the Brent price was $100 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $68 per barrel for the full-year 2021, compared to $39
in 2020. As of mid-February 2022, the WTI price was $95 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is
priced based on the Brent benchmark.
Crude prices increased in 2021 driven by production curtailment by OPEC+ countries and steadily increasing demand for
transportation fuels. The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was $56 per barrel, up 84
percent from 2020. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was $65 per barrel,
up 79 percent from 2020.
Prices for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supply-and-demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In
the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.85 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2021, compared with $1.98 per MCF
during 2020. As of mid-February 2022, the Henry Hub spot price was $3.93 per MCF.
Outside the United States, prices for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The
company’s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity
LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the
Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged $5.93 per MCF during 2021, compared with $4.59 per
MCF during 2020. (See page 42 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.)
The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2021 was a record 3.099 million barrels per day. About 27 percent of the
company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2021 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan,
Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Republic of Congo.
The company estimates that its net oil-equivalent production in 2022 will be flat to down 3 percent compared to 2021, assuming a
Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of asset sales that may close in 2022. This estimate is subject to
many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement
volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance;
greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for crude
oil and natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in
35
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic
conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also
affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the
beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects.
In January 2022, Chevron announced its intent to begin the process of exiting from its nonoperated interests in Myanmar. At
December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the company’s assets was approximately $200 million.
Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.3 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end
2021, an increase of 1 percent from year-end 2020. The reserve replacement ratio in 2021 was 112 percent. The 5 and 10 year
reserve replacement ratios were 103 percent and 100 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company’s
proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2019 and each year-end from 2019 through 2021, and an
accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31,
2021.
Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 39 and 40 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.
Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of
products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels.
Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined
products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas.
Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or
chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from
unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.
Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining,
marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-
charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers.
Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s
refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.
The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron
operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Additionally, the company has a small but
growing presence in renewable fuels.

U.S. Upstream
Millions of dollars 2021 2020 2019
Earnings (Loss) $ 7,319 $ (1,608)$ (5,094)
U.S. upstream reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020. The increase was due to
higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, higher sales volumes of $760
million, and higher asset sales gains of $640 million.
The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was $56.06 per barrel compared with $30.53
in 2020. The average natural gas realization was $3.11 per thousand cubic feet in 2021, compared with $0.98 in 2020.
Net oil-equivalent production in 2021 averaged 1.14 million barrels per day, up 8 percent from 2020. The increase was due to an
additional 162,000 barrels per day of production from the Noble Energy acquisition, partially offset by a 63,000 barrels per day
decrease related to the Appalachian asset sale.
The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2021 averaged 858,000 barrels per day, up 9 percent from 2020. Net
natural gas production averaged 1.69 billion cubic feet per day in 2021, an increase of 5 percent from 2020.

Income tax expense (benefit) $ 5,950 $ (1,892)$ 2,691 
The increase in income tax expense in 2021 of $7.84 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of
$29.09 billion. The increase in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of higher upstream realizations, the
absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, and higher downstream margins.
U.S. income before tax increased from a loss of $5.70 billion in 2020 to income of $9.67 billion in 2021. This $15.37 billion
increase in income was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins and the absence of 2020
impairments and write-offs. The increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax resulting in an increase
to tax expense of $3.18 billion between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $1.58 billion in 2020 to a charge of $1.60
billion in 2021.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
International income before tax increased from a loss of $1.75 billion in 2020 to income of $11.97 billion in 2021. This $13.72
billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-
offs. The increased income primarily drove the $4.66 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year
periods, from a tax benefit of $308 million in 2020 to a charge of $4.35 billion in 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash The strength of the company’s balance sheet enables it to fund any timing differences throughout the
year between cash inflows and outflows.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Total balances were $5.7 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was $29.2 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in 2020, primarily
due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension
plans of approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and
deposits related to asset sales of $1.4 billion in 2021 and $2.9 billion in 2020.
Restricted cash of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was held in cash and short-term
marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and
funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges.
Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $10.2 billion in 2021 and $9.7 billion in 2020.
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $31.4 billion at December 31, 2021, down from
$44.3 billion at year-end 2020.
The $12.9 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2021 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term
notes that matured during the year, the early retirement of long-term notes and the credit facility held by Noble Midstream Partners
LP, and the elimination of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program. The company completed a tender offer,
with the objective of lowering future interest expenses, and redeemed bonds with a book value (including fair market price
adjustments) of $3.4 billion in October 2021. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting
primarily of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $8.0 billion at December 31, 2021,
compared with $11.4 billion at year-end 2020. Of these amounts, $7.8 billion and $9.8 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at
the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively.
At year-end 2021, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2022, as the company
had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.
The company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible
debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.
The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or
decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation,
43
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
CUSA, Noble, and Texaco Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and
are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper
is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions,
the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the
company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of
low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the
ability to modify its capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program. This provides the flexibility to
continue paying the common stock dividend and remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.
Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 19 Short-Term Debt.
Summarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries CUSA issued bonds that are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together, the “Obligor Group”). The tables below
contain summary financial information for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and CUSA,
as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a
combined basis, and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial information for non-guarantor
entities has been excluded.

Common Stock Repurchase Program The Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program in 2019, with a maximum
dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. During 2021, the company purchased 12.9 million shares for $1.4 billion under the
program. As of December 31, 2021, the company had purchased a total of 61.5 million shares for $6.8 billion, resulting in $18.2
billion remaining under the program. The company currently expects to repurchase $1.25 billion of its common stock during the
first quarter of 2022.
Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or in such
other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a
variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors.
The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be
suspended or discontinued at any time.

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures
Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

Total reported expenditures for 2021 were $11.7 billion, including $3.2 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate
expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. In 2020, expenditures were $13.5 billion, including the
company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $4.0 billion. The acquisition of Noble is not included in the company’s capital and
exploratory expenditures.
Of the $11.7 billion of expenditures in 2021, 82 percent, or $9.6 billion, related to upstream activities. Approximately 81 percent
was expended for upstream operations in 2020. International upstream accounted for 51 percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in 2021 and 53 percent in 2020.
The company estimates that 2022 organic capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $15 billion, including
$3.6 billion of spending by affiliates, an increase of over 25 percent from 2021 expenditures. This includes approximately $800
million in lower carbon spending that aims to reduce the carbon intensity of the company’s operations and grow its lower carbon
businesses.
In the upstream business, approximately $8 billion is allocated to currently producing assets, including about $3 billion for Permian
Basin unconventional development and approximately $1.5 billion for other shale and tight assets worldwide. Additionally, $3
billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway, of which about $2 billion is associated with the
FGP/WPMP at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Finally, approximately $1.5 billion is allocated to exploration, early-stage
development projects, midstream activities and carbon reduction opportunities.
Worldwide downstream spending in 2022 is estimated to be $2.3 billion, including capital targeted to grow renewable fuels and
products businesses. Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2022 are budgeted at $0.4 billion.
The company monitors crude oil market conditions and can adjust future capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate.
Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $873 million at December 31, 2021 and $1.0 billion at
December 31, 2020. Distributions to noncontrolling interests net of contributions totaled $36 million and $24 million in 2021 and
2020, respectively. Included within noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2021 is $135 million of redeemable noncontrolling
interest.
Pension Obligations Information related to pension plan contributions is included in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans, under the
heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”
Contractual Obligations Information related to the company’s significant contractual obligations is included in Note 19 Short-
Term Debt, in Note 20 Long-Term Debt and in Note 5 Lease Commitments. The aggregate amount of interest due on these
obligations, excluding leases, is: 2022 – $683; 2023 – $533; 2024 – $447; 2025 – $388; 2026 – $305; after 2026 – $3,143.
Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements
Information related to these off-balance sheet matters is included in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments, under the
heading “Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements.”
Direct Guarantees Information related to guarantees is included in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the

Financial Ratios and Metrics
The following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company
and its performance over time:
Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities
with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a
last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2021, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average
acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $5.6 billion.

Current liabilities 26,791 22,183 26,530 
Current Ratio 1.3 1.2 1.1
Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest,
less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s
ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2021 was higher than 2020 due to higher
income.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk
The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates
of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of
future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the
heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.
47
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products,
natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments
to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase,
sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company
refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities
were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2021.
The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the
company’s risk management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by
the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.
Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes
and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2021 was not
material to the company’s results of operations.
The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in
fair value, at the 95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market
conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk
exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was not material to the company’s cash
flows or results of operations.
Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency
exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures
and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31,
2021.
Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the
interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and
losses reflected in income. At year-end 2021, the company had no interest rate swaps.
Transactions With Related Parties
Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements
include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in Note 15
Investments and Advances for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent
with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental
issues. The liability balance of approximately $12.8 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2021 is related primarily to
upstream properties.
For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or
cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise
decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.
Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the
company’s 2021 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading
“Environmental” for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 25
Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.

Environmental Matters
The company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and
market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and
complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.
For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the
responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated
into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable.
They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range
effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and
natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve in many
jurisdictions where we operate. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 25 for a discussion of some of the
inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.
Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in
the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new
or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control,
reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged
by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be
significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse
effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.
Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for
corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the
company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been
handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations
followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or
both to meet current standards.
Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental
spending in 2021 at approximately $1.9 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately
$0.3 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.6 billion of costs associated
49
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested
sites, and the decommissioning and restoration of sites.
For 2022, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the
ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates
and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial
statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the
SEC, wherein:
1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to
account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is
material.
The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated
disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas
of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows:
Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense
accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that
geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing
economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped
volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s
estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and
development, production and carbon costs.
The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the
valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements,
using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
1.Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP)
basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using
total proved reserves. During 2021, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and
gas properties was $13.7 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2021 were 6.9 billion barrels for
consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations
had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2021 would have increased by
approximately $700 million.
2.Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant
reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some
cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a
further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant
and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.
Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,”, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended December
31, 2021, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves”
for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil
and gas exploration and production activities.
Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and
equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset,
an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such
as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook
for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products.
However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s
business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment
in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies.
The company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying
value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves
are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would
trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or
local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas.
Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an
impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no
impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are
not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets
would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets’ associated carrying values.
Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities
of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying
value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the
investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in
any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and
impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved
in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in
larger impacts on impaired assets.
Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various
assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of
settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A
sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2021 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived
assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have
reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes
would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement
obligations.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the
company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of
pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.
The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions
are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
51
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and
life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care
cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included in Note 23 Employee
Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes
beyond the company’s control.
For 2021, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.0 percent
and a discount rate for interest cost of 1.9 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2021 was 11.2 percent.
For the 10 years ended December 31, 2021, actual asset returns averaged 9.8 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception
of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.5 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2021 was $1.2 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate
would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of
return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about
67 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $81
million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2021 by
approximately $357 million.
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2021, was a net liability of approximately $3.4 billion. An increase in the
discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2021, the company
used a discount rate of 2.8 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity
of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary
U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan
obligation by approximately $425 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $1.2 billion
to $800 million.
For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2021 was $85 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2021, was $2.5
billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 2.9 percent and a discount rate for
interest cost of 1.6 percent to measure expense in 2021, and a 2.8 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at
December 31, 2021. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial
impact on 2021 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2021.
Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience
are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on the $5.1 billion of
before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2021. In addition, information related to company
contributions is included on page 91 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit
Payments.”
Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and
environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for
settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and
assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of
changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site
contamination, and improvements in technology.
Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to
be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and
administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than
50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other
Contingencies and Commitments under the heading Income Taxes. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this
section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the
three years ended December 31, 2021.
An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not
practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide
range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. For further
information, refer to “Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material

Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 24 and 25.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements
To the Stockholders of Chevron Corporation
Management of Chevron Corporation is responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the
related information appearing in this report. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and fairly represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The
financial statements include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has
audited the company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).
The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the
company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent
registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the
internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit Committee
without the presence of management.
The company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the company’s disclosure controls
are effective in ensuring that information required to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported, are done within the
time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the company’s management
concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Chevron Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
56
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
The Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
As described in Notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s upstream property, plant and
equipment, net balance was $130.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was
$16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for
crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved
crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method,
generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved
mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are
produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas
reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs.
Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control
process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Company’s earth
scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as “management’s specialists”).
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved crude oil and
natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by
management, including the use of management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas
reserve volumes, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures
and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in
developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management’s estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management’s specialists was used
in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis
for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was
assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of
the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings.

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion
and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ
from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary
companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary.
Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in
and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or
for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity
method.
Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be
below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the
investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the
determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the
decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will
be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these
equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving
rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the
difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.
Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented
separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated
Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest.
Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an
asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level
3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk
posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge
accounting with changes in fair value recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For other similar
derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply
hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity
trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest
rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-
rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron
is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed
with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.
Inventories Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In
the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable
value.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production
activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas
properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized.
Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be
classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic
and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 21 Accounting for
Suspended Exploratory Wells for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment
by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments
for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market
value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast or carbon costs), significant change in the extent or manner of
use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or
otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to
their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the
company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In
Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area,
as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.
Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its
fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and
adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 9 Fair Value Measurements relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a
liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-
lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations relating to AROs.
Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral
interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are
produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method
by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are
expensed.
The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used
to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets.
Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group
amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other
income.”
Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain
facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
Leases Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and
associated right-of-use assets. The company has elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognizes right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company has elected the practical expedient to not
separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant
non-lease (i.e., service) components.
Where leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes 100 percent of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the
company is the sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of a joint venture). Lease costs reflect
only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share. The lease term includes the committed lease term identified in
the contract, taking into account renewal and termination options that management is

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

reasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term
of the lease unless the implicit rate is available.
Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the
reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past
operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and
the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in
accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement
Obligations for a discussion of the company’s AROs.
For U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the
probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory
agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based
on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as
assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and
those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period
income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other
than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.
Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as
a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at
the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The
company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these
costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized.
Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The
company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until
market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the
company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.
Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple
products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes
estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods.
Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to
certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for
liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter
of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company’s
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions
by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition,
performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of the three-year performance period. For awards
granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one
third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock
unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date,
subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a
straight-line basis.

Fair Value Measurements
The tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis
at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical
assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2021.
Derivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are
accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to
the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that, if
applicable, are reflected in the table below. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in
active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward
contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-
party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the
Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very
consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information.
Properties, Plant and Equipment The company did not have any individually material impairments in 2021. The company
reported impairments for certain upstream properties in 2020 primarily due to downward revisions to its oil and gas price outlook.
Investments and Advances In 2021, the company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela.
The impact of these impairments is included in “Income (loss) from equity affiliates” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
At year-end 2021, the company had assets measured at fair value Level 3 using unobservable inputs of $140. The carrying value of
these assets were written down to fair value based on estimates derived from internal discounted cash flow models. Cash flows
were determined using estimates of future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and a discount rate
believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.
Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S.
portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less and
money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $5,640 and $5,596 at December 31, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that
would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2021.
“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,155 and $1,141 at December 31, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds
related to certain upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and a financing program.
Long-term debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of $22,164 and $30,805 at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
respectively, had estimated fair values of $23,670 and $34,390, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued
bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $22,835 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $835 and
classified as Level 2.
The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values.
Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not material.
Note 10
Financial and Derivative Instruments
Derivative Commodity Instruments The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas,
liquefied natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. The company applies cash flow hedge
accounting to certain commodity transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk associated with forecasted sales
of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The
company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its
commodity derivative activities.
The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of
the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option
contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are
governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the
nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.
Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and their classification on the Consolidated

Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term
receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”
Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s
short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies
limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and
creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments. For a discussion of credit risk on trade
receivables, see Note 28 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.
Note 11
Assets Held for Sale
At December 31, 2021, the company classified $768 of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12
months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2021 were not material.

Equity
Retained earnings at December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $28,876 and $26,532, respectively, for the company’s share of

Operating Segments and Geographic Data
Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these
subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing
the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for,
developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with
liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and
marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into
petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels;
transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and
marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the
company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance
operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.
The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The
segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated
to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.
The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the
company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).
Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the
effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a
worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. Non-billable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major
operating area are presented in the following table:1

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Operating segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers,
for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, are presented in the table on the next page. Products are transferred between operating segments
at internal product values that approximate market prices.
Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the
sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of
petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This
segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of
refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and
technology companies.

Descriptions of major affiliates and non-equity investments, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value
of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:
Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and
Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2021, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about
$100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of
its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment
is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.
Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and
upgrading project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and,
effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.
Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in
Venezuela. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petroboscan affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began
accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to
Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.
Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical
export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.
Angola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas
produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half
is owned by Phillips 66.
GS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The
joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.*

Litigation
Ecuador
Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of an oil production consortium with
Ecuadorian state-owned Petroecuador from 1967 until 1992. After termination of the consortium and a third-party environmental
audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s remediation obligations.
Following Texpet’s completion of a three-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released
Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s
activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In February 2011, that court entered a judgment against
Chevron for approximately $9,500 plus additional punitive damages. An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of
Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages, resulting in a judgment of approximately $9,500. Ecuador’s highest
Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final appeal in July 2018.
In February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and
state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and
prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States or profiting from their
illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in June 2017,
rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to have the Ecuadorian judgment
recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and enforcement actions were dismissed and
resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador in September 2009 before an arbitral
tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment
Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that the Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that
Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the
Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other
States.” The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate
Chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of
compensation Ecuador owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request
to set aside the Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian
judgment is fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The Hague Court of Appeals. In a
78
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
separate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the Office of the
United States Trade Representative in July 2020. Management continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and
unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further attempts to have it recognized or enforced.
Climate Change
Governmental and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel
producing companies, including Chevron entities, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate
change. Chevron entities are or were among the codefendants in 21 separate lawsuits brought by 17 U.S. cities and counties, two
U.S. states, the District of Columbia and a trade group. One of the city lawsuits was dismissed on the merits, and one of the county
lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff. The lawsuits assert various causes of action, including public nuisance, private
nuisance, failure to warn, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, and violations of consumer
protection statutes, based upon the company’s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions
relating to climate change risks associated with those products. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings
entail the possibility of damages liability (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including
without limitation abatement and disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits, that, while we
believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Further such
proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless
and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend
against such proceedings.
Louisiana
Seven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking
damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal
Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in 39 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the
defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek
damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Plaintiffs’
SLCRMA theories are unprecedented; thus, there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages
and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the claims lack
legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.

 Includes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in valuation allowances (2021 - $(624); 2020 - $0; 2019 - $0).
The 2021 increase in income tax expense of $7,842 is a result of the year-over-year increase in total income before income tax
expense, which is primarily due to higher upstream realizations, the absence of 2020 impairment and write-offs and higher
downstream margins. The company’s effective tax rate changed from 25.4 percent in 2020 to 27.5 percent in 2021. The change in
effective tax rate is mainly due to mix effects resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in
higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions.
The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the
following:

Deferred tax assets valuation allowance 17,651 17,762 
Total deferred taxes, net $ 9,006 $ 7,283 
Deferred tax liabilities decreased by $946 from year-end 2020. The decrease to Investments and other was driven by a consolidated
subsidiary restructuring, partially offset with an increase to Properties, plant and equipment. Deferred tax assets decreased by
$2,780 from year-end 2020. This decrease was primarily related to decreases in tax loss carryforwards for various locations, and
employee benefits, partially offset by the increase in foreign tax credits.
The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and
temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment,
more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2021, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $10,750 and
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $993, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these
tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2022 through 2040. U.S. foreign tax
credit carryforwards of $11,718 will expire between 2022 and 2032.1

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:
At December 31
2021 2020
Deferred charges and other assets $ (5,659) $ (5,286)
Noncurrent deferred income taxes 14,665 12,569 
Total deferred income taxes, net $ 9,006 $ 7,283 
Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested
indefinitely. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S.
state and foreign withholding tax purposes.
U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are
intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no
deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $49,200 at December 31, 2021.
This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate
the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested
indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not
indefinitely reinvested.
Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position
only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be
allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting
standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax
return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020
and 2019. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest
and penalties are not included.

Balance at December 31 $ 5,288 $ 5,018 $ 4,987 
Approximately 82 percent of the $5,288 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, would have an impact on the effective
tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full
valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.
Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout
the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed
as of December 31, 2021. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as
follows: United States – 2013, Nigeria – 2007, Australia – 2009, Kazakhstan – 2012 and Saudi Arabia – 2015.
The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various
jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly
uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant
increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that
still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is
unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.

Weighted-average interest rate at December 31, 2020 was 0.15%.
Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities
because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.
The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2021, the
company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.
At December 31, 2021, the company had $10,075 in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the
refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts
outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for
general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments
on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facility would be
unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (SOFR) when LIBOR has permanently or indefinitely ceased or is no longer representative, or an average of base lending
rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding
under this facility at December 31, 2021.
The company classified $7,759 and $9,825 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the
intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.1

$3.4 billion (including the fair market valuation adjustment for debt acquired in the Noble Energy acquisition), which resulted in an
after-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of $260 million. The company also repaid $1.1 billion of bank loans associated with the
NBLX acquisition during 2021.
In February 2022, the company early-redeemed $1.4 billion in notes at face value that were scheduled to mature in March 2022.

Note 21
Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells
The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient
quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information
that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be
impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended
December 31, 2021:
2021 2020 2019
Beginning balance at January 1 $ 2,512 $ 3,041 $ 3,563 
Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves 56 28 244

Other — 212 (141)
Ending balance at December 31 $ 2,109 $ 2,512 $ 3,041 
 2020 represents fair value of well costs acquired in the Noble acquisition. 2019 represents property sales.
The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have
been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling.
At December 31
2021 2020 2019
Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less $ 65 $ 26 $ 214 
Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year 2,044 2,486 2,827 
Balance at December 31 $ 2,109 $ 2,512 $ 3,041 
Number of projects with exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year 15 17 22 
Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.
Of the $2,044 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2021, $1,119 is related to nine projects
that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $925 balance is related to six projects in areas
requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or
firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already
been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.
The projects for the $925 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’
economic viability: (a) $486 (four projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected
within four years; (b) $439 (two projects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on all 15
projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because
of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the
next five years.
The $2,044 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2021, represents 83
exploratory wells in 15 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:
Aging based on drilling completion date of individual wells: Amount Number of wells

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation
Compensation expense for stock options for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $60 ($47 after tax), $94 ($74 after tax) and $81 ($64 after
tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and
restricted stock units was $701 ($554 after tax), $96 ($76 after tax) and $313 ($266 after tax) for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020.
Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1,274,
$226 and $1,090, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $(15), $8 and $43 for
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Cash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $163, $95 and $119 for 2021, 2020
and 2019, respectively. Cash paid in 2021 included $4 million for Noble awards paid under change-in-control plan provisions.
Awards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May
2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50
million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between
three years for the performance shares and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.
For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special
restricted stock units, five years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights.
Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for
stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.
Noble Share-Based Plans (Noble Plans) When Chevron acquired Noble in October 2020, outstanding stock options granted under
various Noble Plans were exchanged for Chevron options. These awards retained the same provision as the original Noble Plans.
Awards issued may be exercised for up to five years after termination of employment, depending upon the termination type, or the
original expiration date, whichever is earlier. Other awards issued under the Noble Plans included restricted stock awards, restricted
stock units, and performance shares, which retained the same provisions as the original Noble Plans. Upon termination of
employment due to change-in-control, all unvested awards issued under the Noble Plans, including stock options, restricted stock
awards, restricted stock units and performance shares become vested on the termination date. If not exercised, awards will expire
between 2022 and 2029.
Fair Value and Assumptions The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019
were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

Dividend yield 6.0 % 4.0 % 3.8 %
Weighted-average fair value per option granted $ 12.22 $ 13.00 $ 15.82 
Expected term is based on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data.
Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term.

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2021,
2020 and 2019 was $152, $92 and $516, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury
shares upon exercise of these awards.
As of December 31, 2021, there was $57 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7
years.
At January 1, 2021, the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to 4,434,797 shares. During 2021,
2,219,379 performance shares were granted, 1,378,766 shares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 252,345
shares were forfeited. At December 31, 2021, there were 5,023,065 performance shares outstanding that are payable in cash. The
fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $683 and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method.
At January 1, 2021, the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to 3,303,933 shares. During 2021, 1,381,433
restricted stock units were granted, 111,831 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 186,898 units were
forfeited. At December 31, 2021, there were 4,386,637 restricted stock units outstanding that are payable in cash. The fair value of
the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $381, valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2021. In
addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately 3.4 million equivalent shares as
of December 31, 2021. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $75.
Note 23
Employee Benefit Plans
The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as
required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all
qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company
does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations
because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the
company’s other investment alternatives.
The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life
insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs.
For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is
limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or
liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial gains caused by higher
discount rates used to value the obligations and large benefit payments paid to retirees in 2021. For the year ended December 31,
2020, the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the
obligations.
Amounts recognized on a before-tax basis in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and OPEB plans
were $4,979 and $7,278 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts consisted of:

Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % N/A N/A N/A
Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by
actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the
incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies,
and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2021, the company used an expected
long-term rate of return of 6.50 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 67 percent of the company’s pension plan
assets.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the
market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month time period
long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the
year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and
expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield
curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-
quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and
OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis were 2.8 percent, 2.4 percent, and 3.1 percent for 2021, 2020,
and 2019, respectively, for both the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans.
Other Benefit Assumptions For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2021, for the
main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 6.2 percent in 2022 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent
for 2031 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2020, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 6.1 percent
in 2021 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2027 and beyond.

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk
and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity
for benefit payments and portfolio management.
The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 94 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an
Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’
investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation
ranges: Equities 40–65 percent, Fixed Income 20–40 percent, Real Estate 0–15 percent, Alternative Investments 0–5 percent and
Cash 0–25 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines:
Equities 10–30 percent, Fixed Income 55–85 percent, Real Estate 5–15 percent, and Cash 0–5 percent. The other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset
allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To
mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive
index funds.
The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.
Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2021, the company contributed $1,552 and $199 to its U.S. and international pension
plans, respectively. In 2022, the company expects contributions to be approximately $1,100 to its U.S. plans and $200 to its
international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment
returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $150 in 2022; $146 was paid in 2021.
The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next
10 years:

2019, respectively.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some
of its benefit plans. At year-end 2021, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the
shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The
company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as
instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes
until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans,
including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, trust assets of $36 and
$36, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.
Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to
corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $1,165, $462 and
$826 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the
company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and
other share-based compensation that are described in Note 22 Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation.
Note 24
Other Contingencies and Commitments
Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to
audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which
income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 17 Taxes for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited
for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax
benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to
have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management,
adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
Guarantees The company has one guarantee to an equity affiliate totaling $215. This guarantee is associated with certain payments
under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 6-year remaining term of this guarantee,
the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity
agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded
no liability for this guarantee.
Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental
liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation
costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement,
after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.
Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the
amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company
does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The
company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements.
The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be
used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate amounts of required payments under throughput and
take-or-pay agreements are: 2022 – $1,049; 2023 – $1,106; 2024 – $1,119; 2025 – $1,193; 2026 – $1,223 ; after 2026 – $7,626.
The aggregate amount of required payments for other unconditional purchase obligations are: 2022 – $57; 2023 – $257; 2024 –
$242; 2025 – $252; 2026 – $200; after 2026 –

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
$282. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were
$861 in 2021, $514 in 2020 and $836 in 2019.
Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings
related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to
correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the company or other
parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal
Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining
sites.
Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely
that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to
such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that
may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they
are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity.
Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2021, was $960. Included in this balance was $230 related to remediation
activities at approximately 145 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the
provisions of the U.S. federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible
parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
Of the remaining year-end 2021 environmental reserves balance of $730, $466 is related to the company’s U.S. downstream
operations, $50 to its international downstream operations, and $214 to its upstream operations. Liabilities at all sites were
primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both.
The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2021
had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.
Other Contingencies Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S.
federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these
claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses
in future periods.
The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or
restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities,
individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.
Note 25
Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there
is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The
legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or
method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is
factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of
the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and
depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.
AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with
any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates
93
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its
downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2021, 2020 and 2019:
2021 2020 2019
Balance at January 1 $ 13,616 $ 12,832 $ 14,050 
Liabilities assumed in the Noble acquisition — 630 — 
Liabilities incurred 31 10 32 
Liabilities settled (1,887) (1,661) (1,694)

Revisions in estimated cash flows 432 1,245 (184)
Balance at December 31 $ 12,808 $ 13,616 $ 12,832 
In the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” in 2021 primarily reflects increased cost
estimates and scope changes to decommission wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $12,808 balance at the
end of 2021 was $11,611.
Note 26
Revenue
Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is
accounted for outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606, which is not material to this line, on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in
“Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 14 Operating Segments and
Geographic Data for additional information on the company’s segmentation of revenue.
Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $12,877 and
$7,631 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net”
represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others,
primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of
ASC 606.
Contract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in
“Accrued liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for
these items are not material to the company’s financial position.

Note 28
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
Chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $745 million as of December 31, 2021 and $671 million as of December 31,
2020, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances.
The majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $16.4 billion as of
December 31, 2021, which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad
worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely
assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative
risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral.
Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable
balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into
consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach
becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are
typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days.
Chevron’s non-trade receivable balance was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, which includes receivables from certain
governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet
due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management
quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade
receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk. Loans to equity affiliates and non-
equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of $560 million are included within “Investments and
Advances” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at both December 31, 2021 and December 30, 2020.

Acquisition of Noble Energy, Inc.
On October 5, 2020, the company acquired Noble Energy, Inc., an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.
Noble’s principal upstream operations are in the United States, the Eastern Mediterranean and West Africa. Noble’s operations also
include an integrated midstream business in the United States. The acquisition of Noble provides the company with low-cost
proved reserves, attractive undeveloped resources and cash-generating assets.
The aggregate purchase price of Noble was $4,109, with approximately 58 million shares of Chevron common stock issued as
consideration in the transaction, representing approximately 3 percent of shares of Chevron common stock outstanding immediately
after the acquisition. As part of the transaction, the company recognized long-term debt and finance leases with a fair value of
$9,231.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities
assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets
and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition
date, as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow
approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together*
*

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
with appropriate operating cost and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on
observable market prices for Noble’s debt. As a result of measuring the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value,
there was no goodwill or bargain purchase recognized.
The following table summarizes the values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
At October 5, 2020
Current assets $ 1,105 
Investments and long-term receivables 1,282 
Properties (includes $14,935 for oil and gas properties) 16,703 
Other assets 607 
Total assets acquired 19,697 
Current liabilities 1,829 
Long-term debt and finance leases 9,231 
Deferred income taxes 2,355 
Other liabilities 1,394 
Total liabilities assumed 14,809 
Noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest 779 
Net assets acquired $ 4,109 
The following unaudited pro forma summary presents the results of operations as if the acquisition of Noble had occurred January
1, 2019:
Year ended December 31
2020 2019
Sales and other operating revenues $ 96,980 $ 144,303 
Net income $ (9,890)$ 1,412 
The pro forma summary uses estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time. Management believes the
estimates and assumptions to be reasonable; however, actual results may differ significantly from this pro forma financial
information. The pro forma information does not reflect any synergistic savings that might be achieved from combining the
operations and is not intended to reflect the actual results that would have occurred had the companies actually been combined
during the periods presented.

Reserves Governance The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resources classification system modeled after a
system developed and approved by a number of organizations, including the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum
Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into
six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the
commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially
recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet
all SEC and company standards.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty
to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and
government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements
and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is
relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from
new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional
information becomes available.
101
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control
process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the
Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization. The Manager of Global
Reserves has more than 30 years of experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate
degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates
in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has
been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the
American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum
Engineers.
All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation
relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC
guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates.
The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the business units to estimate
reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm
that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve quantities are calculated using
consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual, which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss
reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership
team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed
with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be
discussed with the Board.
RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These
reviews include an examination of the proved reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron
Corporation Reserves Manual.
Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2021, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a
wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling,
production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and
information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and
commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in
the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the
company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.

In 2021, revisions include an increase of 202 million BOE in Australia, primarily from the approval of the Jansz Io Compression
project (Gorgon and Jansz Io make up the Gorgon Project). In the United States, there was a net increase of 192 million BOE
primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins, where 105 million BOE was attributed to improved commodity price
environment, and performance revisions, and 91 million BOE associated with the Anchor Project in the Gulf of Mexico due to
improved commodity price. In Bangladesh, there was an increase of 30 million BOE, primarily from
102
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
the approval of the Bibiyana Optimization Project and entitlement effects. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of
339 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, which includes entitlement effects, changes in field operating assumptions,
reservoir model changes and changes to the FGP/WPMP schedule.
In 2021, extensions and discoveries of 630 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to the increase of activity and
planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the Midland and Delaware basins.
The difference in 2021 extensions and discoveries of 149 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 807 million
BOE as reflected on pages 105 to 107 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 658 million BOE, is primarily due to
proved Extensions and Discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized
directly as proved developed reserves in 2021.
Purchases of 36 million BOE in 2021 are from the acquisition of various properties in the Midland and Delaware basins in the
United States.
Transfers to proved developed reserves in 2021 include 245 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland,
Delaware and DJ basin developments and 125 million BOE in Equatorial Guinea, Canada, and other international locations. These
transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.
During 2021, investments totaling approximately $6.6 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil
and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States
accounted for about $2.8 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins and the
Gulf of Mexico. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $2.5 billion, primarily related to development projects
of TCO in Kazakhstan. An additional $0.4 billion were spent on development activities in Australia. In Africa, about $0.4 billion
was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development
activities in Canada and other international locations were primarily responsible for about $0.5 billion of expenditures.
Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project
development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote
locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending
reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.
At year-end 2021, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained
undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of
developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 400 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the
Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to
occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 200 million BOE have remained
undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the
Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 950 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900
million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. Approximately 800 million BOE are related to TCO in
Kazakhstan and about 100 million BOE are related to Angola LNG. At TCO and Angola LNG, further field development to convert
the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.
Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development
plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2021, improvements in commodity
prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve increases, and negatively
impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances
and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved
undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent and 35 percent.
Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2021, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved
reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government
permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and
civil unrest.
103
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited
At December 31, 2021, proved reserves for the company were 11.3 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of
liquids including crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 are shown in the table on page 105. The
company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids are shown on page 106 and the company’s estimated net proved
reserves of natural gas are shown on page 107.
Noteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2019 through 2021 are discussed below and
shown in the table on the following page:
Revisions In 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being
targeted away from reservoirs with higher gas-to-oil ratios and lower execution efficiencies, and planned divestments in the
Appalachian basin, were primarily responsible for the 153 million barrels decrease in the United States. Operational issues with the
Petropiar upgrader in Venezuela resulted in a decrease in reserves of synthetic oil of 126 million barrels and an increase of crude oil
and condensate reserves of 105 million barrels. Reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 75
million barrels increase at TCO in Kazakhstan. Improved field performance at various fields, including Moho-Bilondo in the
Republic of Congo, Mafumeira in Angola, and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 42 million barrels increase in Africa.
In 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in the Midland and Delaware basins and Anchor in the Gulf of Mexico,
were primarily responsible for the 279 million barrels decrease in the United States. Reserves in Venezuela affiliates decreased by
149 million barrels, primarily due to impairments and accounting methodology change. Entitlement effects and performance
revisions in TCO were primarily responsible for the 180 million barrels increase. Entitlement effects primarily contributed to an
increase of 77 million barrels synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands in Canada and 74 million barrels at multiple locations in
Asia.
In 2021, the 206 million barrels increase in United States was primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware
basins. The higher commodity price environment led to the increase of 126 million barrels in the Gulf of Mexico primarily from
Anchor and a 68 million barrels increase in Midland and Delaware basins due to higher planned development activity. In TCO,
entitlement effects and technical changes in field operating assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were primarily
responsible for the 208 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan. Entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 106
million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In the Other Americas, performance revisions and
price effects, mainly in Canada and Argentina, were primarily responsible for the 41 million barrels increase.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware
basins is being targeted towards liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies, and extensions and discoveries in the
deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 394 million barrels increase in the United States.
Extensions and discoveries in Loma Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 39 million barrels increase in Other
Americas.
In 2020, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 105 million barrels
increase in the United States.
In 2021, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins, and at the Whale Project in the Gulf of Mexico, were
primarily responsible for the 349 million barrels increase in the United States.
Purchases In 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 227 million barrels in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins in
the United States.
Sales In 2019, sales of 69 million barrels in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.
In 2020, sales of 99 million barrels in Asia were in Azerbaijan.
In 2021, sales of 32 million barrels in the United States were in the Midland and Delaware basins.

Noteworthy changes in natural gas liquids proved reserves for 2019 through 2021 are discussed below and shown in the table on
the following page:
Revisions In 2019, portfolio optimizations and low price realizations in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins and
planned divestments in the Appalachian basin were mainly responsible for the 120 million barrels decrease in the United States.
In 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in various fields in Midland and Delaware basins were primarily
responsible for the 71 million barrels decrease in the United States.
In 2021, higher commodity prices resulting in the increase of planned development activity in the Midland and Delaware basins
were primarily responsible for the 107 million barrels increase in the United States.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2019, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins and deepwater fields in the
Gulf of Mexico were primarily responsible for the 140 million barrels increase in the United States.

Noteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2019 through 2021 are discussed below and shown in the table above:
Revisions In 2019, strong performances at Wheatstone and the greater Gorgon areas were mainly responsible for 1.7 TCF increase
in Australia. At TCO in Kazakhstan, reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 223 BCF increase.
Portfolio optimizations and low price realizations in various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins and planned divestments in
the Appalachian basin were mainly responsible for the 2.6 TCF decrease in the United States.
In 2020, the demotion of Jansz Io compression project reserves and lower field performance, partially offset by positive revisions at
Gorgon, were mainly responsible for the net 2.5 TCF decrease in Australia. Capital reductions and commodity price effects in
various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins were mainly responsible for the 509 BCF decrease in the United States. In
Africa, a 229 BCF decrease was primarily due to reduced demand and development plan changes at Meren in Nigeria.
In 2021, the approval of the Jansz Io Compression project was mainly responsible for the 1.2 TCF increase in Australia. Higher
commodity prices, resulting in the increase of planned development activity in the Midland and Delaware basins, were mainly
responsible for the 829 BCF increase in the United States. In TCO, entitlement effects and technical changes in field operating
assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were primarily responsible for the 179 BCF decrease.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2019, extensions and discoveries of 1.0 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and
Delaware basins.
In 2020, extensions and discoveries of 385 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2021, extensions and discoveries of 1.4 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.1 2

Purchases In 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 5.4 TCF in Israel in Asia, 1.5 TCF in the DJ basin, Midland and
Delaware basins and Eagle Ford Shale in the United States and 441 BCF in Equatorial Guinea in Africa.
Sales In 2019, sales of 240 BCF in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.
In 2020, sales of 1.3 TCF were primarily in the Appalachian basin in the United States and 264 BCF primarily in Azerbaijan in
Asia.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This
includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting
period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated
costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and
facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax
rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved reserve
quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may
become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent
management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption
“Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
