CORPORATE STRUCTURE
ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and
production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 16 countries. Our
diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; lower-risk conventional assets
in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments; oil sands assets in Canada; and an
inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately
10,800 people worldwide and had total assets of $70 billion.
ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the
merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on
August 30, 2002.
In April 2012, ConocoPhillips completed the separation of the downstream business into an independent, publicly traded energy
company, Phillips 66.
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Total production, including Libya, of 1,283 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) decreased 7 percent in 2018
compared with 2017. The decrease in total average production primarily resulted from noncore asset dispositions, including the
dispositions of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the Foster Creek Christina Lake (FCCL) Partnership, as well as the majority
of our western Canada gas assets, and our interest in the San Juan Basin in the Lower 48 in 2017; normal field decline; and higher
unplanned downtime, including a third-party pipeline outage in Malaysia in 2018. The decrease in production was partly offset by
growth from the Big 3 Unconventionals—Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware, development programs primarily in Europe and
Alaska, and rampup of major projects in Asia Pacific.
Production excluding Libya was 1,242 MBOED in 2018 compared with 1,356 MBOED in 2017. The volume from closed
dispositions was approximately 200 MBOED in 2017 and 15 MBOED in 2018. The volume from acquisitions was less than 10
MBOED in 2018. Our underlying production, which excludes the full-year impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and Libya,
increased over 5 percent in 2018 compared with 2017.

Table of Contents
Our worldwide annual average realized price was $53.88 per BOE in 2018, an increase of 37 percent compared with $39.19 per
BOE in 2017, reflecting stronger marker prices as well as a shift in our portfolio toward a higher mix of crude oil and less of
bitumen and natural gas. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price increased 31 percent in 2018, from $51.96 per barrel in
2017 to $68.13 per barrel in 2018. Additionally, our worldwide annual average natural gas liquids prices increased 21 percent, from
$25.22 per barrel in 2017 to $30.48 per barrel in 2018. Our worldwide annual average natural gas price increased 39 percent, from
$4.07 per MCF in 2017 to $5.65 per MCF in 2018. Average annual bitumen prices decreased 2 percent, from $22.66 per barrel in
2017 to $22.29 per barrel in 2018.
ALASKA
The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We are
the largest crude oil producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America’s largest oil fields located on
Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a 100 percent interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western
North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest owners of state, federal and fee exploration leases, with approximately
1.25 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2018. Alaska operations contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production
and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.

Greater Prudhoe Area
The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area
fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery
operation, as well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover natural gas liquids before reinjection into the reservoir.
Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven, Lisburne
and North Prudhoe Bay State fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.
Greater Kuparuk Area
We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and
West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which
separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of
rotary-drilled wells and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.
We completed a transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 which increased our interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area by 39.2 percent.
Further discussion of the transaction is included in the “Acquisitions” section below.

Table of Contents
Western North Slope
On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq,
Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a drill site
which extends the Alpine reservoir west into the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). In 2018, we continued drilling
additional wells using the available well slots on this pad.
The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within the NPR-A, was formed in 2008. In 2017, we began
construction in the unit, which is currently planned to have two drill sites; Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT-1) and Greater Mooses
Tooth #2 (GMT-2). GMT-1 achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect first oil from GMT-2 in 2021.
We completed a transaction in the second quarter of 2018 to increase our interest in the Western North Slope from 78 percent to
100 percent. Further discussion of the transaction is included in the “Acquisitions” section below.
Alaska North Slope Gas
In 2016, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a
state-owned corporation, completed preliminary front-end engineering and design (pre-FEED) technical work for a potential LNG
project which would liquefy and export natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it to market. In 2016, we, along with the
affiliates of ExxonMobil and BP, indicated our intention not to progress into the next phase of the project due to changes in the
economic environment. AGDC decided to continue progressing the project on its own and signed several Memorandums of
Understanding with various potential LNG buyers in Asia. AGDC has also signed a Joint Development Agreement with Sinopec,
CIC Capital and Bank of China, which was recently extended to June 30, 2019. In early January 2019, recently elected Governor
Dunleavy appointed new members to AGDC’s board of directors who replaced AGDC’s president with an interim president. The
Dunleavy administration has indicated they are interested in participation in the project by ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and BP.
We remain willing to make our equity gas available for sale to the project at mutually agreed, commercially reasonable terms.
Exploration
Appraisal of the Willow Discovery, located in the northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, continued
throughout 2018 with three appraisal wells. Additionally, the West Willow-1 exploration well, drilled in 2018, resulted in an oil
discovery. In 2019, we will continue appraisal of the Willow and West Willow discoveries.
The Putu 2/2A and Stony Hill 1 wells were drilled in 2018 on state and federal leases, resulting in oil discoveries. In late 2018, we
commenced appraisal of the Putu Discovery with a long reach well from existing Alpine CD4 infrastructure.
The Cairn 2S-315 Well was drilled in late 2018 from the 2S drill site on state leases in the Kuparuk River Unit. A flow test will
commence in the first quarter of 2019.
A 3-D seismic survey was completed in 2018 over a 250-mile area on state lands. We are currently processing this data.
We were successful in the federal lease sale on the North Slope in the fourth quarter of 2018, where we were the high bidder on five
tracts for a total of approximately 48,000 net acres.
Acquisitions
During the second quarter of 2018, we obtained regulatory approvals and completed a transaction we entered into with Anadarko
Petroleum Corporation to acquire its 22 percent nonoperated interest in the Western North Slope of Alaska, as well as its interest in
the Alpine Transportation Pipeline. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 7 MBOED associated with the additional
interest acquired.

Table of Contents
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a transaction with BP to acquire their 39.2 percent nonoperated interest in the
Greater Kuparuk Area, including their 38 percent interest in the Kuparuk Transportation Company in Alaska (Kuparuk Assets), and
to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the
United Kingdom. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 1 MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired
in the Greater Kuparuk Area.
See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, for additional information.
Transportation
We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south central Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in
the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five
company-owned, double-hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska,
primarily to refineries on the west coast of the United States.
LOWER 48
The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous United States and the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48
business is organized within two regions covering the Gulf Coast and Great Plains. As a result of tight oil opportunities, we have
directed our investments toward certain shorter cycle time, low cost of supply plays. We disposed of several noncore assets within
the Lower 48 in 2018, including our interests in the Barnett and certain conventional assets in the Permian Basin. In 2017, we
disposed of our interest in the San Juan Basin. We hold 10.3 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2018, the
Lower 48 contributed 36 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production.

Onshore
We hold 10.3 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either
held by production or owned by the company. Our unconventional holdings total approximately 1.6 million net acres in the
following areas:
 
 • 620,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and eastern Montana.
 • 225,000 net acres in central Louisiana.
 • 200,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas.
 • 145,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.
 • 98,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado.
 • 340,000 net acres in other areas with unconventional potential.
The majority of our 2018 onshore production originated from the Big 3—Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Delaware in the Permian
Basin. Onshore activities in 2018 were centered mostly on continued development of assets, with an emphasis on areas with low
cost of supply, particularly in growing unconventional plays. Our major focus areas in 2018 included the following:
 
 • Eagle Ford—The Eagle Ford continued full-field development in 2018. We operated seven rigs on average in 2018,
resulting in 166 operated wells drilled and 149 operated wells brought online. Production increased 40 percent in 2018
compared with 2017, averaging 186 MBOED and 133 MBOED, respectively.
 • Bakken—We operated an average of three rigs during the year in the Bakken. We continued our pad drilling with 51
operated wells drilled during the year and 85 operated wells brought online. Production increased 29 percent in 2018
compared with 2017, averaging 84 MBOED and 65 MBOED, respectively.
 • Permian Basin—The Permian Basin is an area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing
new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. We hold approximately 800,000 net acres
in the Permian, which includes 145,000 net unconventional acres. The Permian Basin produced 66 MBOED in 2018,
increasing 6 percent compared to 2017, including 28 MBOED of unconventional production from the Delaware. We
disposed of several noncore conventional assets throughout the year.
Dispositions
We completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett in the fourth quarter of 2018. Combined with the sale of several noncore
conventional assets in the Permian Basin, production from the assets sold was 10 MBOED, approximately 3 percent of total Lower
48 production in 2018. For additional information on our asset dispositions, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired
and Other Planned Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Gulf of Mexico
At year-end 2018, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three
fields operated by co-venturers, totaling approximately 68,000 net acres, including:
 
 • 75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.
 • 15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.
 • 15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.
 • 12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon
Area.

Exploration
 
 • Conventional Exploration
In December 2017, we elected to withdraw from our Shenandoah leases. The withdrawal was effective February 17,
2018, substantially completing our exit from deepwater Gulf of Mexico.    
 
 • Unconventional Exploration
Our onshore focus areas include the Niobrara in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the Delaware in the Permian Basin, as well
as several emerging plays such as the Louisiana Austin Chalk. We began acquiring early life-cycle acreage in the Austin
Chalk in the fourth quarter of 2017, and currently hold approximately 225,000 net acres. We spud our first Austin Chalk
well in late 2018 and plan to drill additional wells in 2019.    
Facilities
Golden Pass LNG Terminal
We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline, with a combined
net book value of approximately $235 million at December 31, 2018. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship
Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and
pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3)
(QG3) and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Utilization of the
terminal has been and is expected to be limited, as market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian
markets. In January 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our 12.4 percent ownership interest in Golden Pass LNG Terminal and

On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of
our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Production from the assets sold was 103 MBOED, approximately 62 percent of
the total Canada segment production in 2017. For additional information on our asset dispositions, see Note 5—Assets Held for
Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Oil Sands
Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage
(SAGD), whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to
the surface for further processing. We hold approximately 0.6 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern
Alberta.
The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture
with Total S.A. The second phase of the Surmont project achieved first production in 2015 and reached peak production in 2018.
We are focused on structurally lowering costs, reducing greenhouse gas intensity and optimizing asset performance.
Exploration
We hold exploration acreage in three areas of Canada: onshore western Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the
Arctic Islands. Our primary exploration focus is on unconventional plays in western Canada.
We hold approximately 145,000 net acres in the emerging unconventional Montney play in northeast British Columbia and 207,000
net acres in Canol Northwest Territories. Our Montney activity in 2018 included drilling 13 horizontal wells, completing two
horizontal wells and acquiring approximately 37,000 additional net acres. Appraisal drilling and completions activity will continue
in 2019 to further explore the area’s resource potential.

The Greater Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway, in the North Sea, and comprises three
producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Embla. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden,
Germany. The Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields consist of several production platforms and facilities, including the Ekofisk South and
Eldfisk II developments which achieved first production in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Continued development drilling in the
Greater Ekofisk Area will contribute additional production over the coming years, as additional wells come online.
The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is stored in a floating storage unit and exported via shuttle
tankers. Part of the natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude oil production, some gas is
transported for use as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18 percent interest, and the remainder is
transported to Europe via gas processing terminals in Norway.
The Alvheim Field is located in the northern part of the North Sea near the border with the U.K. sector, and consists of a floating
production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and
natural gas is transported to the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) Terminal at St. Fergus, Scotland, through the SAGE
Pipeline.
Visund is an oil and gas field located in the North Sea and consists of a floating drilling, production and processing unit, and subsea
installations. Crude oil is transported by pipeline to a nearby third-party field for storage and export via tankers. The natural gas is
transported to a gas processing plant at Kollsnes, Norway, through the Gassled transportation system.
The Troll Field lies in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of the Troll A, B and C platforms. The natural gas from Troll
A is transported to Kollsnes, Norway. Crude oil from floating platforms Troll B and Troll C is transported to Mongstad, Norway,

Britannia is one of the largest natural gas and condensate fields in the North Sea. Condensate is delivered through the Forties
Pipeline to an oil stabilization and processing plant near the Grangemouth Refinery in Scotland, while natural gas is transported
through Britannia’s line to St. Fergus, Scotland. The Britannia satellite fields, Callanish, Brodgar, Enochdhu and Alder, produce via
subsea manifolds and pipelines linked to the Britannia Platform.
The J-Area consists of the Judy/Joanne, Jade and Jasmine fields, located in the U.K. Central North Sea. The J-Area gas is processed
on the Judy Platform and transported through the Central Area Transmission System Pipeline, while liquids are transported to
Teesside through the Norpipe system. Continued development drilling in the J-Area will provide additional volumes in the coming
years as wells are brought online.
We have various ownership interests in several gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas of the Southern North Sea.
Production ceased in August 2018, and decommissioning activity in the Southern North Sea is ongoing. Our interests in the East
Irish Sea include the Millom, Dalton and Calder fields, which are operated on our behalf by a third party.
We own a 7.5 percent interest in the Clair Field, located in the Atlantic Margin. We completed the sale of a subsidiary holding a
16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field in December 2018 to BP. See the “Disposition” section below for more information. Clair
Ridge is the second phase of development for the Clair Field and is comprised of a 36-slot drilling and production facility with a

Australia Pacific LNG
Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation
(Sinopec), is focused on producing coalbed methane (CBM) from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, to supply
the domestic gas market and convert the CBM into LNG for export. Origin operates APLNG’s upstream production and pipeline
system, and we operate the downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG
export sales business.
Two fully subscribed 4.5-million-metric-tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been completed. Approximately 3,900 net wells are
ultimately expected to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts.    The wells are supported by gathering
systems, central gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and an export pipeline connecting the gas fields
to the LNG facilities. The first APLNG Train 1 cargo sailed in January 2016, and APLNG Train 2 achieved first production in the
third quarter of 2016. The LNG is being sold to Sinopec under 20-year sales agreements for 7.6 million metric tonnes of LNG per
year, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. under a 20-year sales agreement for approximately 1 million metric tonnes
of LNG per year.
APLNG has an $8.5 billion project finance facility, which was fully drawn down and had an outstanding balance of $7.2 billion at
December 31, 2018. In September 2018, APLNG successfully refinanced $1.4 billion of the project finance facility for a lower cost
United States Private Placement (USPP) bond facility. Project finance interest payments are bi-annual, concluding September 2030.

Receivables, and Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Bayu-Undan
The Bayu-Undan gas condensate field is located in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and
Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point,
Darwin.
The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; and
re-injects dry gas back into the reservoir. In addition, a 310-mile natural gas pipeline connects the facility to the
3.5-million-metric-tonnes-per-year capacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it
is converted into LNG before being transported to international markets. In 2018, we sold 157 billion gross cubic feet of LNG
primarily to utility customers in Japan.

production entitlement to natural gas produced from WA-17-L is forecast to end in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Greater Sunrise
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the
government of Timor-Leste for $350 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is conditional on the funding
approval from the Timor-Leste government as well as regulatory approvals.
Exploration
We operate three exploration permits in the Browse Basin, offshore northwest Australia, in which we own a 40 percent interest in
permits WA-315-P, WA-398-P and TP 28, of the Greater Poseidon Area. The TP 28 Western Australia State exploration permit was
granted for five years from January 2017, with a 40 percent working interest and was excised from the existing permits as agreed
between state and federal regulators. Phase I of the Browse Basin drilling campaign in 2009/2010 resulted in three discoveries in
the Greater Poseidon Area: Poseidon-1, Poseidon-2 and Kronos-1. Phase II of the drilling campaign resulted in five additional
discoveries: Boreas-1, Zephyros-1, Proteus-1 SD2, Poseidon-North-1 and Pharos-1. All wells have been plugged and abandoned.
We operate two retention leases in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, where we own a 37.5 percent interest in leases
NT/RL5 and NT/RL6, containing the Barossa and Caldita discoveries. A 3-D seismic survey was completed over the Barossa and
Caldita fields in 2016. The drilling of the Barossa-5A and Barossa-6 appraisal wells was completed in 2017 with good quality,
gas-bearing reservoir intersected at both. Additionally, the retention lease over the Barossa Field was renewed during 2017. In April
2018, Barossa entered the front-end engineering and design (FEED) phase of development which will continue through 2019.
During the FEED phase, costs and the technical definition for the project will be finalized, gas and condensate sales agreements
progressed, and access arrangements negotiated with the owners of the Darwin LNG Facility and Bayu-Darwin Pipeline.

Our Commercial organization manages our worldwide commodity portfolio, which mainly includes natural gas, crude oil, bitumen,
natural gas liquids and LNG. Marketing activities are performed through offices in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. In
marketing our production, we attempt to minimize flow disruptions, maximize realized prices and manage credit-risk exposure.
Commodity sales are generally made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. We also purchase and sell third-party volumes
to better position the company to satisfy customer demand while fully utilizing transportation and storage capacity.
Natural Gas
Our natural gas production, along with third-party purchased gas, is primarily marketed in the United States, Canada, Europe and
Asia. Our natural gas is sold to a diverse client portfolio which includes local distribution companies; gas and power utilities; large
industrials; independent, integrated or state-owned oil and gas companies; as well as marketing companies. To reduce our market
exposure and credit risk, we also transport natural gas via firm and interruptible transportation agreements to major market hubs.
Crude Oil, Bitumen and Natural Gas Liquids
Our crude oil, bitumen and natural gas liquids revenues are derived from production in the United States, Canada, Australia, Asia,
Africa and Europe. These commodities are primarily sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for
location, quality and transportation.
LNG
LNG marketing efforts are focused on equity LNG production facilities located in Australia and Qatar. LNG is primarily sold under
long-term contracts with prices based on market indices.
Energy Partnerships
Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC)
We are a founding member of the MWCC, a non-profit organization formed in 2010, which provides well containment equipment
and technology in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC’s containment system meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control
incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. For additional information, see Note 3—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP)
In 2011, we, along with several leading oil and gas companies, launched the SWRP, a non-profit organization based in Stavanger,
Norway, which was created to enhance the industry’s capability to respond to international subsea well control incidents. Through
collaboration with Oil Spill Response Limited, a non-profit organization in the United Kingdom, subsea well intervention
equipment is available for the industry to use in the event of a subsea well incident. This complements the work being undertaken
in the United States by MWCC and provides well capping and containment capability outside the United States.
Oil Spill Response Removal Organizations (OSROs)
We maintain memberships in several OSROs across the globe as a key element of our preparedness program in addition to internal
response resources. Many of the OSROs are not-for-profit cooperatives owned by the member companies wherein we may actively
participate as a member of the board of directors, steering committee, work group or other supporting role. Globally, our primary
OSRO is Oil Spill Response Ltd. based in the United Kingdom, with facilities in several other countries and the ability to respond
anywhere in the world. In North America, our primary OSROs include the Marine Spill Response Corporation for the continental
United States and Alaska Clean Seas and Ship Escort/Response Vessel System for the Alaska North Slope and Prince William
Sound, respectively. Internationally, we maintain memberships in various regional OSROs including the Norwegian Clean Seas
Association for Operating Companies, Australian Marine Oil Spill Center and Petroleum Industry of Malaysia Mutual Aid Group.

Technology
We have several technology programs that improve our ability to develop unconventional reservoirs, produce heavy oil
economically with fewer emissions, improve the efficiency of our company’s exploration program, increase recoveries from our
legacy fields, and implement sustainability measures.
Our Optimized Cascade® LNG liquefaction technology business continues to be successful with the demand for new LNG plants.
The technology has been licensed for use in 26 LNG trains around the world, with feasibility studies ongoing for additional trains.
RESERVES
We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our estimated total proved reserves at
December 31, 2018. No difference exists between our estimated total proved reserves for year-end 2017 and year-end 2016, which
are shown in this filing, and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2018.
DELIVERY COMMITMENTS
We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify
the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where
the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market.
Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, including approximately
243 billion cubic feet related to the noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and 73 million barrels of crude oil in the
future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2029. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery
commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we anticipate using proved undeveloped reserves and spot market
purchases to fulfill any remaining commitments. See the disclosure on “Proved Undeveloped Reserves” in the “Oil and Gas
Operations” section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the development of proved
undeveloped reserves.
COMPETITION
We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the E&P business. Some of our competitors are larger
and have greater resources. Each of our segments is highly competitive, with no single competitor, or small group of competitors,
dominating.
We compete with numerous other companies in the industry, including state-owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of
supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on statistics
published in the September 3, 2018, issue of the Oil and Gas Journal, we were the third-largest U.S.-based oil and gas company in
worldwide natural gas and liquids production and worldwide liquids reserves in 2017. We deliver our production into the
worldwide commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and
technology; experience and expertise; economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and safely operating oil and gas
producing properties.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. These risk factors are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. If any of these risks were to occur, our
business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock could be adversely
affected.
Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing
commodity prices.
Prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG can fluctuate widely. Globally, prices for crude oil, bitumen,
natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG have experienced significant declines from their historic levels during 2013 and 2014,
with excess of supply relative to global demand leading to global inventory builds. Although commodity prices began to rise in
2018, there was a sharp drop in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, ending 2018 lower than where they started at the
beginning of the year for the first time since 2015. Given volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide economic
environment generally, price trends may continue to be volatile.
Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen,
natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control.
Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues,
operating income, cash flows and liquidity, and on the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock.
Lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically, adversely affecting our proved reserves and
reserve replacement ratio, and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream
fields.
Significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG prices could also require us to reduce our
capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves. In
the past three years, we recognized several impairments, which are described in Note 9—Impairments and the “APLNG” section of
Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If commodity prices
remain low relative to their historic levels, and as we continue to optimize our investments and exercise capital flexibility, it is
reasonably likely we will incur future impairments to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities
accounted for under the equity method and unproved properties. Although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of
any future impairments at this time, our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.
Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.
Dividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors,
including:
 
 • Cash available for distribution.
 • Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations.
 • Our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties.
 • The level of distributions paid by comparable companies.
 • Our operating expenses.
 • Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.
 
20
Table of Contents
We expect to continue to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders; however, our Board of Directors may determine that our
funds generated by operations, after deducting operating expenses, are not sufficient to pay our desired levels of distributions to our
stockholders or to pay distributions to our stockholders at all.
Additionally, our Board of Directors has authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, of which $9 billion of repurchase
authority remained as of December 31, 2018. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of
shares during any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same
factors that our Board of Directors may consider when declaring distributions, among others.
Any downward revision in the amount of distributions we pay to stockholders or the number of shares we purchase under our share
repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
We may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms.
We have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fund our operations and strategy; however, we have
also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital markets for funding. There can be no assurance that additional
debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, although we anticipate we will be
able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plans, there can be no assurance we will be
able to do so. Our ability to obtain additional financing, or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance
with our plans, will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment
and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our then-outstanding debt. If we are unable to
generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, our business could be adversely affected.
In addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors, including our financial strength
and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally. For example, due to the significant decline in prices for crude oil,
bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG in 2015, and the expectation that these prices could remain depressed, the major
ratings agencies conducted a review of the oil and gas industry and downgraded our debt ratings and those of several companies
operating in the industry in 2016. Any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for
possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur.
Our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third
parties with whom we do business.
The operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of
industries, including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. These counterparties may default on their obligations to
us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy. Market speculation about the
credit quality of these counterparties, or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations, may also exacerbate any
operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing, particularly as it relates to other companies in the oil and gas
industry as a result of the volatility in commodity prices. Any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to
perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or
results of operations. In addition, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to
compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances. We may also be forced to
incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty, which could further adversely
impact our results of operations.

Table of Contents
In particular, in August 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) providing for the
payment of approximately $2 billion over a five-year period in connection with an arbitration award issued by the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Tribunal in favor of ConocoPhillips on a contractual dispute arising from Venezuela’s expropriation
of our interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and other pre-expropriation fiscal measures. We collected
approximately $0.4 billion of the $2 billion settlement in 2018. If PDVSA were to default on any of its remaining payment
obligations under this agreement, we may be forced to incur additional costs as we seek to recover any unpaid amounts under the
agreement.
Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids
production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.
The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct
successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify
additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas
and natural gas liquids. Accordingly, to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural
gas liquids we produce with good prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of
operations. Any cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a result of commodity price declines may further limit our ability to
replace depleted reserves.
The exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry.
The exploration and production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids is a highly competitive business. We
compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business, including to locate
and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids in an efficient, cost-effective
manner. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do or may be willing to incur a higher level of risk
than we are willing to incur to obtain potential sources of supply. If we are not successful in our competition for new reserves, our
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas
liquids reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.
Our proved reserve information included in this annual report has been derived from engineering estimates prepared by our
personnel. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of
crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids that cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers,
each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of
reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Any significant future price changes could have a material
effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our
estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur
impairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from
changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. In addition to changes in the quantity and value of our proved reserves,
the amount of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids that can be obtained from any proved reserve may ultimately
be different from those estimated prior to extraction.
 
22
Table of Contents
We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing
and future environmental laws and regulations.
Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which are expected to
continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. For a
description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations, see the “Contingencies—Environmental” section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These laws and regulations continue to
increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:
 
 • Permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities.
 • The discharge of pollutants into the environment.
 • Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions.
 • Carbon taxes.
 • The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous
wastes.
 • The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.
 • Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs
and tight oil plays.
We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a
result of these laws and regulations. Any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements
could result in administrative or civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement actions or third-party litigation against us. To the
extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.
Existing and future laws, regulations and initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on greenhouse gas
emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or
reduce demand for our products.
Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending
international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions, such
as cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for
renewable energy. For example, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of
the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris that prepared an agreement requiring member
countries to review and represent a progression in their intended greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years
beginning in 2020. While the United States announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, there is no guarantee
that the commitments made by the United States will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by U.S. state and local governments
or by major corporations headquartered in the United States. In addition, our operations continue in countries around the world
which are party to, and have not announced an intent to withdraw from, the Paris Agreement. The implementation of current
agreements and regulatory measures, as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and greenhouse gas
emissions, may adversely impact the demand for our products, impose taxes on our products or operations or require us to purchase
emission credits or reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations. As a result, we may experience declines in
commodity prices or incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs, any of
which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
23
Table of Contents
Furthermore, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations
and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. In 2017 and 2018, cities, counties,
a state government, and a trade association in California, New York, Washington, Rhode Island and Maryland have filed lawsuits
against several oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate
alleged climate change impacts. ConocoPhillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuits. The ultimate outcome and impact to
us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar
lawsuits in the future.
In addition, although our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent
there are significant changes in the earth’s climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we
operate or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be adversely impacted, and
demand for our products could fall. For more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global
climate change that affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company’s response, see the “Contingencies—
Climate Change” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our
profitability and cash flows.
Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreign governments, through sanctions, tax and other legislation, executive order and
commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. In certain locations,
governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on our operations; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency
regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of
other countries.
One area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique
that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state,
federal and national laws and regulations currently govern or, in some hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic fracturing
in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and
permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others which could result
in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Certain
jurisdictions in which we operate, including state and local governments in Colorado, have adopted or are considering regulations
that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil
and natural-gas operations, including subsurface water disposal. In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot
initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and natural-gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in
particular. For example, in 2018, Colorado voters rejected Proposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically
limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in Colorado. In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions or prohibitions are
adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we
conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in
the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments,
limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity.
 
24
Table of Contents
The U.S. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of
foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions
by host governments, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, have affected operations
significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Changes in domestic and international regulations may affect our
ability to collect payments such as those pertaining to the settlement with PDVSA or to obtain or maintain permits, including those
necessary for drilling and development of wells in various locations.
Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 55 percent
of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the United States in 2018, and 41 percent of our proved
reserves, as of December 31, 2018, were located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in
international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, natural gas
liquids or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments (including the effect of international
trade discussion and disputes), changing political conditions and international monetary and currency rate fluctuations. In
particular, some countries where we operate lack well-developed legal systems or have not adopted clear legal and regulatory
frameworks for oil and gas exploration and production. This lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risks,
including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local
government authorities, such as expropriations.
Our business may be adversely affected by price controls, government-imposed limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen,
natural gas and natural gas liquids, or the unavailability of adequate gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and
pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
As discussed above, our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have
imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural
gas liquids wells below actual production capacity. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation,
we cannot predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us.
Our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG that we produce also depends on the
availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment, as
well as any necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG for transport. The
facilities, equipment and diluents we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme weather
events, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, in
certain newer plays, the capacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production
from existing and new wells, and construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could
limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment. If any facilities, equipment or
diluents, or any of the transportation methods and channels that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time, we may
incur increased costs to transport our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG for sale or we may be forced to
curtail our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids or LNG.
Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.
We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture partners. There is a
risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with
those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may
be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately
manage the risks associated with any operations, acquisitions or dispositions could have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.
 
25
Table of Contents
We may not be able to successfully complete any disposition we elect to pursue.
From time to time, we may seek to divest portions of our business or investments that are not important to our ongoing strategic
objectives. Any dispositions we undertake may involve numerous risks and uncertainties, any of which could adversely affect our
results of operations or financial condition. In particular, we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition on a timeline
or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, whether due to market conditions, regulatory challenges or other concerns. In addition, the
reinvestment of capital from disposition proceeds may not ultimately yield investment returns in line with our internal or external
expectations. Any dispositions we pursue may also result in disruption to other parts of our business, including through the
diversion of resources and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matters, or through the disruption
of relationships with our employees and key vendors. Further, in connection with any disposition, we may enter into transition
services agreements or undertake indemnity or other obligations that may result in additional expenses for us.
As part of our disposition strategy, on May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL
Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction included
208 million Cenovus Energy common shares. We may not be able to liquidate the shares issued to us by Cenovus Energy at prices
we deem acceptable, or at all.
Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.
The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks
such as explosions, fires, crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civil unrest
or cyber attacks. Our operations may also be adversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving services or
infrastructure required to develop, produce, process or transport our production, such as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines,
railcars, tankers, barges or other infrastructure. Our operations are subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic
gas and other environmental hazards and risks. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of
complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean conditions. All such hazards could
result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations,
substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation. Further, our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond,
or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are
unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity.
Our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cyber attacks.
Our business, like others within the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, some of which
are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. Among other
activities, we rely on digital technology to estimate oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze
seismic and drilling information and communicate with employees and third parties. As a result, we face various cyber security
threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information about our operations and our employees,
attempts to render our data or systems (or those of third parties with whom we do business) corrupted or unusable, threats to the
security of our facilities and infrastructure as well as those of third parties with whom we do business and attempted cyber
terrorism.
In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to
deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and
infrastructure on which they rely, many of which are not owned or operated by us, could damage critical production, distribution or
storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle
transactions.

Table of Contents
Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cyber security, none of these breaches have had a
material effect on our business, operations or reputation. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we must continually expend
additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities
detected. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security
for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Despite our ongoing investments in security
resources, talent and business practices, we are unable to assure that any security measures will be effective.
If our systems and infrastructure were to be breached, damaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious negative consequences,
including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of counterparty trust, reimbursement or other costs,
increased compliance costs, significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention. Any of
these could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we have business
continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and
infrastructure that support our business. While we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans, there can be no
assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts. Further, our insurance may not be adequate to
compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal,
state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings
include those matters that arose during the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as matters previously reported in our 2017 Form 10-K
and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2018 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to the fourth quarter of 2018. Material
developments to the previously reported matters have been included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately
predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings were to be decided adversely to
ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings
are reported pursuant to SEC regulations.
On April 30, 2012, the separation of our downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies:
ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. In connection with the separation, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement,
which provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and established procedures for handling claims subject to
indemnification and related matters, such as legal proceedings. We have included matters where we remain or have subsequently
become a party to a proceeding relating to Phillips 66, in accordance with SEC regulations. We do not expect any of those matters
to result in a net claim against us.
Matters Previously Reported—Phillips 66
In May 2012, the Illinois Attorney General’s office filed and notified ConocoPhillips of a complaint with respect to operations at
the Phillips 66 WRB Wood River Refinery alleging violations of the Illinois groundwater standards and a third-party’s hazardous
waste permit. The complaint seeks remediation of area groundwater; compliance with the hazardous waste permit; enhanced
pipeline and tank integrity measures; additional spill reporting; and yet-to-be specified amounts for fines and penalties.
Matters Previously Reported—ConocoPhillips
On June 28, 2018, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued a Proposed Agreed Order to ConocoPhillips Company
to resolve alleged violations of the Texas Health & Safety Code and/or Commission Rules occurring in 2015 through 2017 at a
formerly owned gas injection plant in Howard County, Texas, through the payment of a penalty of $457,750 and the
implementation of measures designed to prevent a reoccurrence. The company will work with the Commission to promptly resolve
this matter.

*There were no repurchases of common stock from company employees in connection with the company’s broad-based employee incentive plans.
On November 10, 2016, we announced plans to purchase up to $3 billion of our common stock through 2019. On March 29, 2017,
we announced plans to double our share repurchase program to $6 billion of common stock through 2019, with $3 billion allocated
and purchased in 2017, and the remainder allocated evenly to 2018 and 2019. On February 1, 2018, we announced the acceleration
of our previously stated 2018 share repurchases from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. On July 12, 2018, we announced plans to further
accelerate our 2018 share repurchases to $3 billion. The 2018 expansion to $3 billion, combined with the $3 billion of shares
repurchased during 2016 and 2017, fully utilized the Board of Directors’ existing share repurchase authorization of $6 billion. As a
result, our Board authorized an additional $9 billion for share repurchases, at any time or from time to time (whether before, on or
after December 31, 2019), bringing the total program authorization to $15 billion. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program
are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be
increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plan are held as
treasury shares. See Risk Factors “Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain
considerations.”

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
ConocoPhillips is the world’s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and
production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 16 countries. Our
diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; lower-risk conventional assets
in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments; oil sands assets in Canada; and an
inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately
10,800 people worldwide and had total assets of $70 billion.
Overview
In 2018, the energy industry continued to be volatile. Forecasts of worldwide economic growth and strong global demand for crude
oil at the beginning of the year transitioned to concerns about a worldwide economic slowdown and an oversupply of crude oil by
the end of the year. Additionally, production from major oil producing countries, including the United States, was strong. These
factors caused crude oil prices to fall rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our business strategy anticipates prices will remain
cyclical and is designed to be resilient in lower price environments, with significant upside during periods of higher prices.
Our value proposition principles, namely to focus on returns, maintain financial strength, grow our dividend and pursue disciplined
growth, are being executed in accordance with our priorities for allocating cash flows from the business. These priorities are: invest
capital at a level that maintains flat production volumes and pays our existing dividend; grow our existing dividend; maintain debt
at a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating through price cycles; repurchase shares to
provide value to our shareholders; and invest capital to grow our cash from operations.
In 2018, we successfully delivered on our priorities. We increased our quarterly dividend by 15 percent to $0.305 per share;
reduced our debt by $4.7 billion, achieving our debt reduction target 18 months ahead of plan and received credit rating upgrades
from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s; repurchased 45 million shares of our common stock totaling $3.0 billion and received
Board authorization for an incremental $9 billion of share repurchases; and added to our low cost of supply resource base,
including increasing our legacy asset position in Alaska through two separate acquisitions.
 
34
Table of Contents
Portfolio optimization, debt reduction and disciplined capital investment have positioned our company to navigate through periods
of volatile energy prices. In December 2018, we announced our 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, which is less than our 2018
capital expenditures and investments of $6.8 billion. Our 2019 capital budget is relatively flat to the prior year when excluding
$0.6 billion of acquisitions made in 2018. At this level of capital, production excluding Libya is expected to be 1,300 to
1,350 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in 2019 and would exceed 2018 production excluding Libya of 1,242
MBOED. This plan anticipates cash provided by operating activities in excess of capital expenditures and investments at prices
above $40 per barrel West Texas Intermediate (WTI).
Key Operating and Financial Summary
Significant items during 2018 included the following:
 
 • Cash provided by operating activities was $12.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures and investments of
$6.8 billion, share repurchases of $3 billion and dividends of $1.4 billion.
 • The $4.4 billion of share repurchases and dividends represents 34 percent of cash provided by operating activities.
 • Reduced debt by $4.7 billion and achieved $15 billion debt target 18 months ahead of plan.
 • Received credit rating upgrades from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.
 • Full-year production excluding Libya of 1,242 MBOED; underlying production grew 18 percent on a production per
debt-adjusted share basis.
 • Increased full-year Lower 48 Big 3 production—Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware—by 37 percent.
 • Achieved first production from Bayu-Undan final development phase, GMT-1, Bohai Phase 3, Aasta Hansteen and Clair
Ridge.
 • Acquired additional working interest in our legacy assets in Alaska and increased our acreage in the liquids-rich
Montney play in Canada and in the early-life cycle unconventional Louisiana Austin Chalk.
 • Executed successful exploration program in Alaska and started drilling in Louisiana Austin Chalk.
 • Reached a settlement agreement with Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) to fully recover the International Chamber
of Commerce (ICC) arbitration award of approximately $2 billion; recognized $430 million before-tax toward the
settlement.
 • Generated disposition proceeds of $1.1 billion from noncore asset sales.
 • Year-end proved reserves of 5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE); 147 percent total reserve replacement and
109 percent organic replacement ratio.
Operationally, we continue to focus on safely executing our capital program and remaining diligent on our costs. Production,
including Libya, of 1,283 MBOED decreased 7 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. The volume from closed dispositions was
approximately 200 MBOED in 2017 and 15 MBOED in 2018. The volume from acquisitions was less than 10 MBOED in 2018.
Production from Libya was 21 MBOED in 2017 and 41 MBOED in 2018. Our underlying production, which excludes the full-year
impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and Libya, increased over 5 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. Underlying production on a
per debt-adjusted share basis grew by 18 percent compared to 2017. Production per debt-adjusted share is calculated on an
underlying production basis using ending period debt divided by ending share price plus ending shares outstanding. We believe
production per debt-adjusted share is useful to investors as it provides a consistent view of production on a total equity basis by
converting debt to equity and allows for comparison across peer companies.
In the second quarter of 2018, we obtained regulatory approvals and completed a transaction with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
to acquire its 22 percent nonoperated interest in the Western North Slope of Alaska, as well as its interest in the Alpine
Transportation Pipeline, for $386 million, after customary adjustments. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 7
MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired. In addition, we now have 100 percent interest in approximately
1.2 million acres of exploration and development lands, including the Willow Discovery.

Table of Contents
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a transaction with BP to acquire its nonoperated interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area
and Kuparuk Transportation Company (Kuparuk Assets) in Alaska, and to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held
16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. In 2018, our Alaska segment net
production included 1 MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired in the Greater Kuparuk Area, and net production in
our Europe and North Africa segment included 5 MBOED related to the disposed 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field. We
recognized a $774 million after-tax gain in the fourth quarter related to this transaction. Excluding receipt of $253 million in
customary adjustments, this transaction was cash neutral.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after
customary adjustments. In 2018, our Lower 48 segment net production included 8 MBOED related to the disposed interest in the
Barnett, of which approximately 55 percent was natural gas and 45 percent was natural gas liquids. After-tax impairment charges of
$69 million were recognized during 2018.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the
government of Timor-Leste for $350 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is conditional on the funding
approval from the Timor-Leste government as well as regulatory approvals. No production or reserve impacts are associated with
the sale. Proceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes. The Greater Sunrise Fields are included in our
Asia Pacific and Middle East segment.    
For more information regarding the accounting impacts of these transactions, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired
and Other Planned Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Also during 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with PDVSA to recover approximately $2 billion, which reflects the full
amount awarded to ConocoPhillips by an arbitral tribunal constituted under the rules of the ICC. PDVSA has agreed to recognize
the ICC judgment and to make payments over the next four and a half years. During the year, we recognized in other income
$417 million after-tax, consisting of $200 million in cash and the remainder in commodity inventory, the majority of which was
sold by year end. For more information, see Note 4—Inventories and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Environment
Brent crude oil prices averaged over $60 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018, rising to over $70 per barrel in the second and third
quarters of 2018, before falling to the $50 per barrel range at the end of the year. The energy industry has periodically experienced
this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions. Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting
our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business. Our strategy is to create value through price
cycles by delivering on the disciplined financial and operational priorities that underpin our value proposition.
Operational and Financial Factors Affecting Profitability
The focus areas we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include:
 
 • Maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship. Safety and environmental stewardship, including
the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and
safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our
business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive
sustainable business growth. Demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, on
November 2017, we announced our intention to target a 5 to 15 percent reduction in our greenhouse gas emission

Table of Contents
 intensity by 2030. Our sustainability efforts continued through 2018 with a focus on advancing our action plans for
climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights. In December 2018, we became a Founding Member of the Climate
Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental
interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue
about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy principles. We also belong to and fund
Americans for Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC. We are committed to building a
learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved Health, Safety and
Environment and operational performance.
 
 • Focus on financial returns. This is a core aspect of our value proposition. Our goal is to achieve strong financial returns
by controlling our costs, exercising capital discipline and continually optimizing our portfolio.
 
 ¡  Control costs and expenses. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and
environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are
reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Managing
operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a
low commodity price environment. The ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our
ability to deliver strong cash from operations. In 2018, our production and operating expenses were relatively
flat to 2017.
 
 ¡  Maintain capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital intensive industry, with
varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and
generates cash flow. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas
fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and LNG facilities.
We allocate capital across diverse, low cost of supply, programs in our resource base. Our cash allocation
priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to maintain production and pay the existing dividend.
Additional allocations of capital toward growth projects will be dependent on satisfaction of other financial
priorities. In setting our capital plans, we exercise a disciplined approach that evaluates projects on a cost of
supply basis and is focused on value maximization and cash flow expansion.
In December 2018, we announced a 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion, including $3.8 billion of sustaining
capital to maintain existing production levels, and $2.3 billion to grow production via short-cycle
unconventional programs, future major projects and exploration activities.
 
 ¡  Optimize our portfolio. We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost of supply assets
that support our strategy. In 2018, we continued to dispose of or market certain noncore assets and made two
acquisitions in Alaska to enhance our existing legacy asset position. We will continue to evaluate our assets
to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing
our capital investments to areas that align with our objectives.
 
 • Maintain financial strength. We believe financial strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours. In 2018, we
reduced our debt by $4.7 billion to $15.0 billion at year end, achieving our debt reduction target 18 months ahead of plan
and received credit rating upgrades from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. We expect to retire outstanding debt as
it matures and exercise flexibility in paying down our other debt instruments.
 
 • Return capital to shareholders. In 2018, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $1.4 billion and
repurchased $3 billion of our common stock, representing 34 percent of our cash provided by operating activities. We
believe in delivering value to our shareholders through the price cycles. As a result, we set a priority to increase our
dividend rate annually and consistently repurchase shares on a dollar cost average basis. Since we initiated our current
share repurchase program in late
 
37
Table of Contents
2016, we have bought back $6 billion of shares, with $9 billion remaining on our existing authorization. Our 2018
dividends, share repurchases, and capital program were fully funded with cash provided by operating activities.
On February 1, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.285
per share, compared with the previous quarterly dividend of $0.265 per share. In October 2018, we announced a dividend
increase for the second time this year, an additional 7 percent, resulting in a quarterly dividend rate of $0.305 per share.
In addition to the $6 billion of shares repurchased in 2016 through the end of 2018, in July 2018 we announced the
authorization of an additional $9 billion share repurchases. We expect to execute $3 billion of this $9 billion share
repurchase program in 2019. Whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous
considerations, including market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors “Our ability to declare and pay dividends
and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.”
 
 • Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in two ways:
 
 ¡  Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields.
 ¡  Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
Proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and
current costs. Therefore, our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Reserve
replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as
shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. In 2018, our reserve replacement, which included a net increase of
0.2 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was 147 percent. Increased crude oil reserves accounted for over 90 percent of
the total change in reserves. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was
109 percent in 2018. Approximately 33 percent of organic reserve additions are from Lower 48 unconventional assets,
29 percent from Alaska and 22 percent from Asia Pacific and Middle East.
In the five years ended December 31, 2018, our reserve replacement was negative 30 percent, reflecting the impact of
asset dispositions and lower prices during that period. Our organic reserve replacement during the five years ended
December 31, 2018, which excludes a decrease of 2.1 billion MMBOE related to sales and purchases, was 44 percent,
reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period.
Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or
unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability,
competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other
regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add
to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
 
 • Apply technical capability. We leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans.
Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices.
Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our
operations. Such innovations enhance our ability to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve
greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact.

Table of Contents
 • Develop and retain a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge
and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. To this end, we offer university
internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best talent and, as needed, recruit experienced hires to maintain a
broad range of skills and experience. We promote continued learning, development and technical training through
structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees.
Other Factors Affecting Profitability
Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:
 
 • Energy commodity prices. Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude
oil and natural gas. Industry price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no
control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or
military conflicts, actions taken by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), environmental laws, tax
regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. The following graph depicts the average benchmark
prices for WTI crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas:
 
Brent crude oil prices averaged $71.04 per barrel in 2018, an increase of 31 percent compared with $54.27 per barrel in
2017. Similarly, WTI crude oil prices increased 28 percent from $50.90 per barrel in 2017 to $64.92 per barrel in the
same period of 2018. Crude oil prices improved year over year due to slower growth in global oil production and robust
growth in global oil demand. Oil price volatility escalated in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to geopolitics and concerns
about future economic growth.
Henry Hub natural gas price averages were relatively unchanged, at $3.09 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) in
2018 compared with $3.11 per MMBTU in 2017. Despite record high natural gas production, prices remained relatively
flat year over year as relatively low inventories and strong demand offset production growth.
Our realized natural gas liquids prices averaged $30.48 per barrel in 2018, an increase of 21 percent compared with
$25.22 per barrel in 2017, in line with marker movements.
The Western Canada Select (WCS) differential to WTI at Hardisty weakened by $14 per barrel in 2018 relative to 2017
due to a lack of pipeline egress coupled with increasing supply from western Canada. The weaker WCS differential
offset year-over-year gains in WTI, resulting in the WCS price
 
39
Table of Contents
at Hardisty remaining flat in 2018 compared with 2017 at $39 per barrel. We continue to optimize bitumen price
realizations through the utilization of downstream transportation solutions and implementation of alternate blend
capability which results in lower diluent costs. Our realized bitumen price was $22.29 per barrel in 2018, a decrease of
2 percent compared with $22.66 per barrel in 2017.
Our worldwide annual average realized price was $53.88 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2018, an increase of
37 percent compared with $39.19 per BOE in 2017. The improvement reflects stronger marker prices, as well as a shift
in our portfolio toward a higher mix of crude oil and less of bitumen and natural gas.
North America’s energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance. In
recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased
industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant
short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to
development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period
of low commodity prices; production curtailments; delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields; and
underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be
reduced and additional asset impairments might be possible.
 
 • Impairments. We participate in a capital intensive industry. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and
investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our
reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We
may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a
material impairment of leasehold values. As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur
future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated
entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties. For additional information on our impairments
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 • Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even
in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly
between periods based on the “mix” of before-tax earnings within our global operations.
 
 • Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political
environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained
relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments could
negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative
impact on future operations. Our assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007. Our production operations in Libya and
related oil exports were suspended or significantly curtailed periodically over the last several years due to the closure of
the Es Sider crude oil export terminal. In 2016, the U.K. government enacted tax legislation which reduced our U.K.
corporate tax rate by 10 percent.
We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) in 2017 and throughout 2018. At December 31, 2017, our assessment was
ongoing for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Legislation under Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” for the following aspects: remeasurement
of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and tax on global intangible low-taxed income. As of
 
40
Table of Contents
December 31, 2018, we have now completed our assessment of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax
Legislation. During 2018, we recognized adjustments of $10 million to the provisional tax benefit amount of
$852 million recorded at December 31, 2017, and included these adjustments as a component of income tax expense.
While we still anticipate the Tax Legislation will provide a positive impact to our U.S. operations in the future primarily
because of the reduced U.S. federal statutory rate, we do not expect to realize cash tax benefits from the Tax Legislation
until we move into a U.S. tax paying position. For additional information, see Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the
levels and locations of our activity.
Outlook
First-quarter 2019 production is expected to be 1,290 to 1,330 MBOED, reflecting the impacts of a planned turnaround in Qatar of
approximately 15 MBOED and government-mandated production curtailment in Canada of approximately 10 MBOED. Production
is expected to ramp up in the second half of the year, with full-year 2019 production expected to be 1,300 to 1,350 MBOED.
Production guidance for 2019 excludes Libya.
Operating Segments
We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48,
Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums
incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received.
Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that
follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production.

Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips   $ 6,257   (855)   (3,615) 
  
2018 vs. 2017
Net income attributable to ConocoPhillips increased $7,112 million in 2018. The increase was mainly due to:
 
 • Higher realized commodity prices on a more liquids-weighted portfolio.
 • The absence of a combined $2.5 billion after-tax impairment related to the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin and
the marketing of our Barnett asset, recognized in the second quarter of 2017.
 • The absence of a $2.4 billion before- and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd
(APLNG), recognized in the second quarter of 2017.
 • Recognition of $774 million after-tax gain on the Clair disposition in the United Kingdom, in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 • Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from
reserve revisions and disposition impacts.
 • Recognition of $417 million after-tax in other income from a settlement agreement with PDVSA in 2018.
 • Lower exploration expenses, primarily due to the absence of first quarter 2017 charges in our Lower 48 and Other
International segments.
 • Lower interest and debt expense because of a lower debt balance.
 • Higher equity earnings in Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3) and APLNG, primarily due to higher
realized LNG prices, partly offset by the absence of volumes in 2018 related to the disposition of our interest in the
FCCL Partnership in Canada in 2017.
These increases in net income were partly offset by:
 
 • The absence of $1.6 billion in after-tax gains related to the sale of certain Canadian assets in 2017.
 • The absence of a $996 million deferred tax benefit related to the disposition of certain Canadian assets, recognized in the
first quarter of 2017.
 • The absence of deferred tax benefits totaling $852 million related to the Tax Legislation enacted on December 22, 2017.
 • An unrealized loss of $437 million on our Cenovus Energy common shares in 2018.
 • The absence of a $337 million after-tax award, including interest, from an arbitration settlement with The Republic of
Ecuador in 2017.
 
42
Table of Contents
2017 vs. 2016
Loss attributable to ConocoPhillips decreased $2,760 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to:
 
 • Higher commodity prices.
 • Lower DD&A expense, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from reserve revisions and disposition impacts.
 • Higher gains on dispositions, primarily due to a $1.6 billion after-tax gain in 2017 on the sale of certain Canadian assets.
 • Recognition of deferred tax benefits totaling $996 million, primarily related to the disposition of certain Canadian assets.
 • Recognition of deferred tax benefits totaling $852 million related to the Tax Legislation enacted on December 22, 2017.
 • Improved equity earnings, mainly due to higher realized prices, lower DD&A from asset disposition impacts, and the
absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of the tax functional currency for
APLNG to the U.S. dollar. These increases were partly offset by lower volumes from the disposition of our interest in the
FCCL Partnership.
 • Lower exploration expenses mainly due to reduced leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs and other exploration
expenses.
 • A $337 million after-tax award, including interest, from an arbitration settlement with The Republic of Ecuador.
 • Lower production and operating expenses, primarily due to asset disposition impacts.
 • Lower net interest expense, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest expense
in the United States and reduced debt.
The reduction in loss was partly offset by:
 
 • Higher proved property and equity investment impairments, including a combined $2.5 billion after-tax impairment
related to the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin and the marketing of the Barnett, as well as a $2.4 billion before-
and after-tax impairment of our equity investment in APLNG.
 • Lower volumes primarily due to asset dispositions in our Lower 48, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Canada segments,
as well as normal field decline.
 • A $238 million after-tax charge associated with our early retirements of debt in 2017.
Income Statement Analysis
2018 vs. 2017
Sales and other operating revenues increased 25 percent in 2018, due to higher realized commodity prices, mainly crude oil, on a
portfolio with a higher mix of crude oil and less of bitumen and natural gas. Partly offsetting this increase, were lower natural gas
volumes sold due to 2017 dispositions in the Lower 48 and Canada.
Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $302 million in 2018. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to higher earnings
from QG3 and APLNG as a result of higher LNG prices for both affiliates and higher oil prices in QG3. Partly offsetting this
increase, was the absence of equity in earnings resulting from the disposition of our investment in the FCCL Partnership in 2017.
Gain on dispositions decreased $1,114 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of a $2.1 billion before-tax
gain on the sale of certain Canadian assets recognized in 2017, partly offset by a $715 million before-tax gain recognized in the
fourth quarter of 2018 on the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the
BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. For additional information concerning gain on dispositions, see Note 5—Assets
Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
43
Table of Contents
Other income decreased $356 million in 2018, mainly due to a $437 million unrealized loss on our Cenovus Energy common
shares in 2018 and the absence of a $337 million arbitration settlement, including interest, with The Republic of Ecuador in 2017.
Partly offsetting the decrease, was $430 million before-tax from a settlement agreement with PDVSA in 2018.
For discussion of our Cenovus Energy shares, see Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. For discussion of our Ecuador and PDVSA settlements, see Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Purchased commodities increased 15 percent in 2018, mainly due to higher crude oil volumes purchased and higher crude oil
prices.
Production and operating expenses increased 1 percent in 2018, primarily due to costs associated with higher underlying production
volumes as well as higher maintenance and wellwork, largely offset by the absence of costs resulting from 2017 dispositions in our
Canada and Lower 48 segments.
Exploration expenses decreased $565 million in 2018, primarily as a result of lower dry hole costs, leasehold impairment expense
and other exploration expenses.
Dry hole costs were reduced primarily due to the absence of before-tax charges of $288 million for multiple Shenandoah wells in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, including wells previously suspended. These charges were reflected in our Lower 48 segment
during 2017.
Leasehold impairment expense was reduced mainly due to the absence of before-tax charges of $51 million for Shenandoah and
$38 million for certain Lower 48 mineral assets, both recognized in 2017.
Other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $43 million before-tax charge for the cancellation of our
Athena drilling rig contract and other rig stacking costs in our Other International segment in 2017.
For additional information on leasehold impairments and other exploration expenses, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other
Exploration Expenses, and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
DD&A decreased $889 million in 2018, mainly due to lower unit-of-production rates from positive reserve revisions and impacts
from the 2017 dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments, partly offset by increased underlying production volumes.
Impairments decreased $6.6 billion in 2018, mainly due to the absence of 2017 impairments of $3.9 billion before-tax related to our
former interests in the San Juan Basin and the Barnett, both in our Lower 48 segment, as well as a $2.4 billion before- and after-tax
impairment of our equity investment in APLNG. For additional information, see Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term
Receivables and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Taxes other than income taxes increased $239 million in 2018, primarily due to higher production taxes in Alaska and the Lower 48
corresponding with higher realized commodity prices.
Interest and debt expense decreased $363 million in 2018, primarily due to lower debt balances.
See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax
provision (benefit) and effective tax rate.
 
44
Table of Contents
2017 vs. 2016
Sales and other operating revenues increased 23 percent in 2017, mainly due to higher realized prices across all commodities, partly
offset by lower sales volumes, primarily in our Lower 48, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Canada segments as a result of
dispositions.
Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $720 million in 2017. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to higher realized
commodity prices at QG3, APLNG and FCCL; the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from a tax
functional currency change; and reduced costs mainly from the disposition of our interest in the FCCL Partnership. The increase in
earnings was partly offset by lower volumes as a result of our FCCL disposition.
Gain on dispositions increased $1.8 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to a before-tax gain of $2.1 billion on the sale
of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets. For
additional information on gains on dispositions, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned
Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other income increased $274 million in 2017, mainly due to a $337 million before- and after-tax arbitration award from The
Republic of Ecuador. The increase was partly offset by the absence of a gain of $88 million from our receipt of mineral properties
and active leases from the Greater Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust and a $76 million before-tax damage claim settlement, both
in our Lower 48 segment in 2016.
Purchased commodities increased 25 percent in 2017, mainly due to higher commodity prices and increased activity.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10 percent in 2017, primarily due to reduced restructuring expenses, lower
headcount and reduced activity.
Exploration expenses decreased 51 percent in 2017, primarily as a result of lower leasehold impairment expense, dry hole costs and
other exploration expenses.
Leasehold impairment expense was reduced mainly due to the absence of 2016 before-tax charges of $203 million for our Gibson
and Tiber leaseholds. The expense was further reduced by the absence of before-tax charges of $95 million for our Melmar
leasehold and $79 million for various Gulf of Mexico leases after completion of marketing efforts. The reduction was partly offset
by a before-tax charge of $51 million for Shenandoah in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and a before-tax charge of $38 million for
certain mineral assets in our Lower 48 segment, both in 2017.
Dry hole costs were reduced primarily due to the absence of 2016 before-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $249 million
for our Gibson and Tiber wells, and $128 million for our Melmar well. The absence of a $256 million before-tax charge in 2016 for
two dry holes in Nova Scotia further reduced costs. The reduction in dry hole costs was partly offset by 2017 before-tax charges of
$288 million for multiple wells in Shenandoah, including wells previously suspended, and $63 million for several wells in the
Powder River Basin.
Other exploration expenses were reduced mainly due to the absence of a $146 million before-tax expense in 2016 related to the
cancellation of our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract, as well as lower rig stacking costs in Angola. The decrease in
expense was partly offset by a $43 million net before-tax charge in 2017 for the settlement of our drilling rig contract in Angola.

Table of Contents
2018 vs. 2017
Total production, including Libya, of 1,283 MBOED decreased 7 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to:
 
 • Disposition impacts from asset sales in Canada and the Lower 48 in 2017.
 • Normal field decline.
 • Higher unplanned downtime, including a third-party pipeline outage in Malaysia in 2018.
The decrease in production during 2018 was partly offset by:
 
 • New wells online, primarily from tight oil plays in the Lower 48 and Malikai in Malaysia.
 • Improved drilling and well performance in Alaska, Norway, Lower 48 and China.
 • The continued rampup in Libya.
Production excluding Libya was 1,242 MBOED in 2018 compared with 1,356 MBOED in 2017. The volume from closed
dispositions was approximately 200 MBOED in 2017 and 15 MBOED in 2018. The volume from acquisitions was less than 10
MBOED in 2018. Our underlying production, which excludes the full-year impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and Libya,
increased over 5 percent in 2018 compared with 2017.
2017 vs. 2016
Total production, including Libya, of 1,377 MBOED decreased 12 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to:
 
 • Reductions from noncore asset dispositions, including Canada and the Lower 48 in 2017 and the sale of our interest in
the Block B production sharing contract in Indonesia in 2016.
 • Normal field decline.
The decrease in production during 2017 was partly offset by:
 
 • Production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Malikai and the Kebabangan gas field in
Malaysia; Surmont in Canada; and APLNG in Australia.
 • Improved drilling and well performance in Alaska, Norway and China.
Excluding Libya, our 2017 production was 1,356 MBOED. Adjusted for the impact of closed and planned dispositions of 191
MBOED in 2017 and 434 MBOED in 2016 and Libya, our underlying production increased 32 MBOED, or 3 percent, compared
with 2016.

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. In 2018,
Alaska contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.
2018 vs. 2017
Alaska reported earnings of $1,814 million in 2018, compared with earnings of $1,466 million in 2017. The increase in earnings
was mainly due to higher realized crude oil prices. Additionally, earnings were improved due to the absence of a $110 million
after-tax impairment related to our small interest in the Point Thomson Unit, recognized in the first quarter of 2017; a $98 million
reduction in tax valuation allowance, recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018; lower DD&A expense from reserve additions; and a
$79 million after-tax benefit resulting from an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Partly offsetting these increases in earnings, was the absence
of an $892 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance
with the Tax Legislation enacted in 2017.
Average production increased 2 percent in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to improved drilling and well performance, 8
MBOED from acquisitions in the Western North Slope and the Greater Kuparuk Area, and the startup of GMT-1 in the fourth
quarter of 2018, partly offset by normal field decline.
Acquisitions
During the second quarter of 2018, we obtained regulatory approvals and completed a transaction with Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation to acquire its 22 percent nonoperated interest in the Western North Slope of Alaska, as well as its interest in the Alpine
Transportation Pipeline, for $386 million, after customary adjustments. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 7
MBOED associated with the additional interest acquired. In addition, we now have 100 percent interest in approximately
1.2 million acres of exploration and development lands, including the Willow Discovery.
In December of 2018, we completed a transaction with BP to acquire their nonoperated interest in the Kuparuk Assets in Alaska,
and to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in
the United Kingdom. In 2018, our Alaska segment net production included 1 MBOED related to the additional interest acquired in
the Greater Kuparuk Area. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Table of Contents
2017 vs. 2016
Alaska reported earnings of $1,466 million in 2017, compared with earnings of $319 million in 2016. The increase in earnings was
mainly due to an $892 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in
accordance with the Tax Legislation. Earnings were additionally improved due to higher crude oil prices in 2017. The earnings
increase was partly offset by a $110 million after-tax impairment charge for the associated properties, plants and equipment of our
small interest in the Point Thomson unit.
Average production increased 2 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, as the impact of normal field decline was more than offset by
well performance in the Western North Slope, Greater Prudhoe and Greater Kuparuk areas and lower unplanned downtime.

The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous United States and the Gulf of Mexico. During 2018, the
Lower 48 contributed 36 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production.
2018 vs. 2017
Lower 48 reported earnings of $1,747 million in 2018, compared with a net loss of $2,371 million in 2017. Earnings increased
primarily due to the absence of a combined $2.5 billion after-tax impairment related to the sale of our interests in the San Juan
Basin and the marketing of our Barnett asset, recognized in the second quarter of 2017; higher realized crude oil and NGL prices;
higher crude oil sales volumes; lower DD&A expense, primarily due to reserve additions and asset disposition impacts, partly offset
by higher underlying volumes; lower exploration expenses and higher gain on dispositions related to noncore asset sales. The
increase in earnings was partly offset by lower natural gas sales volumes, primarily due to the disposition of our interests in the San
Juan Basin in 2017.
In 2018, our average realized crude oil price of $62.99 per barrel was 3 percent less than WTI of $64.92 per barrel. The differential
was driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast, Bakken and Permian Basin.
 
49
Table of Contents
Total average production decreased 1 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. The decrease was mainly attributable to normal field
decline and disposition impacts related to interests sold in the San Juan Basin and other noncore assets. Adjusted for the impact of
dispositions of 82 MBOED in 2017, underlying production increased approximately 25 percent in 2018 compared with 2017,
primarily due to new production from unconventional assets in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian Basin.
Asset Dispositions and Other Planned Disposition
In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of certain properties in the Lower 48 segment for net proceeds of $112 million.
No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. In the second quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of a package of largely
undeveloped acreage for net proceeds of $105 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. In the third quarter of 2018, we
completed a noncash exchange of undeveloped acreage in the Lower 48 segment. This transaction was recorded at fair value
resulting in the recognition of a $44 million after-tax gain. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold several packages of undeveloped
acreage in the Lower 48 segment for total net proceeds of $162 million and recognized gains of approximately $140 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after
customary adjustments. Production associated with the Barnett averaged 8 MBOED in 2018, of which approximately 55 percent
was natural gas and 45 percent was natural gas liquids. After-tax impairment charges of $69 million were recognized during 2018.
In January 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our 12.4 percent ownership interests in Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden
Pass Pipeline located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal and
pipeline capacity was held for receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. As a result of entering into these
agreements, we expect to recognize a loss of approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2019. We have also entered into
agreements to amend our contractual obligations for remaining use of the facilities. Completion of the sale is subject to regulatory
approval.                
See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, for additional information.
Acquisition
We began acquiring early life-cycle acreage in the Austin Chalk in the fourth quarter of 2017 and have accumulated approximately
225,000 net acres at less than $1,000 per acre. We spud our first Austin Chalk well in late 2018 and plan to drill additional wells in
2019.    
2017 vs. 2016
Lower 48 reported a loss of $2,371 million after-tax in 2017, compared with a loss of $2,257 million after-tax in 2016. The increase
in loss was primarily due to proved property impairments in 2017, totaling $2.5 billion after-tax, for our interests in the San Juan
Basin and the Barnett which were written down to fair value less costs to sell. Lower natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids
sales volumes from asset dispositions and normal field decline further increased losses during the year.
 
50
Table of Contents
The increase in losses was partly offset by:
 
 • Lower DD&A expense, mainly resulting from a lower unit-of-production rate from reserve revisions, disposition impacts
and lower volumes.
 • A $689 million tax benefit, primarily related to the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower federal
statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation enacted in 2017.
 • Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices.
 • Lower exploration expenses mainly due to:
 
 ¡  Lower leasehold impairment expense, primarily the absence of 2016 after-tax charges of $132 million for our
Gibson and Tiber leaseholds; $62 million for our Melmar leasehold and $52 million for various Gulf of Mexico
leases after completion of marketing efforts. The reduction was partly offset by an after-tax charge of $33 million
for Shenandoah in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and an after-tax charge of $24 million for certain mineral assets,
both in 2017.
 ¡  Lower other exploration expenses, mainly due to the absence of a $95 million after-tax expense in 2016 related to
the cancellation of our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract.
 ¡  Lower dry hole costs primarily due to the absence of 2016 after-tax charges in deepwater Gulf of Mexico of
$162 million for our Gibson and Tiber wells, and $83 million for our Melmar well, partly offset by 2017 after-tax
charges of $187 million for multiple wells in Shenandoah and $41 million for several wells in the Powder River
Basin.
In 2017, our average realized crude oil price of $47.36 per barrel was 7 percent less than WTI of $50.90 per barrel. The differential
is driven primarily by local market dynamics in the Gulf Coast and Bakken.
Total average production decreased 18 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to normal field
decline and the disposition of our interests in the San Juan Basin, partly offset by new production, primarily from Eagle Ford and
Bakken.
Asset Dispositions
On July 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin for total proceeds comprised of $2.5 billion in cash
after customary adjustments and a contingent payment of up to $300 million. The six-year contingent payment, effective beginning
January 1, 2018, is due annually for the periods in which the monthly U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per million British
thermal units. During 2018, we recorded gains on dispositions for these contingent payments of $28 million.
On September 29, 2017, we completed the sale of our interest in the Panhandle assets for $178 million in cash after customary
adjustments.

*Average prices for sales of bitumen produced during 2018 excludes additional value realized from the purchase and sale of third-party volumes for optimization of
our pipeline capacity between Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Our Canadian operations mainly consist of an oil sands development in the Athabasca region of northeastern Alberta and a liquids-
rich unconventional play in western Canada. In 2018, Canada contributed 8 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less
than one percent of our worldwide natural gas production.
2018 vs. 2017
Canada operations reported earnings of $63 million in 2018 compared with $2,564 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to
the absence of a $1.6 billion after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the FCCL Partnership and western Canada gas assets and an
associated $1.0 billion deferred tax benefit, and equity earnings in the FCCL Partnership. For additional information on the Canada
disposition, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions and Note 7—Investment in
Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Total average production decreased 95 MBOED in 2018 compared with 2017. The production decrease was primarily due to our
2017 Canada disposition, partly offset by strong well performance at Surmont.
Acquisition
In February 2018, we acquired approximately 34,500 net acres of undeveloped land in the Montney for a net purchase price of
approximately $120 million. The additional acreage is adjacent to our existing position in the liquids-rich portion of the Montney.
 
52
Table of Contents
2017 vs. 2016
Canada operations reported earnings of $2,564 million in 2017, an increase of $3,499 million compared with 2016. The earnings
increase was mainly due to an after-tax gain of $1.6 billion on the sale of certain Canadian assets, further discussed below, as well
as the recognition of $1.0 billion in deferred tax benefits related to the capital gains component of our disposition and the
recognition of previously unrealizable Canadian tax basis.
In addition to the items discussed above, earnings were further increased due to:
 
 • Lower DD&A, mainly from disposition impacts.
 • Lower dry hole costs, mainly due to the absence of 2016 combined after-tax charges in offshore Nova Scotia of
$187 million for our Cheshire and Monterey Jack wells.
 • Higher realized prices across all commodities.
 • A $114 million tax benefit related to our prior decision to exit Nova Scotia deepwater exploration.
 • Lower production and operating expenses.
 • Improved equity earnings, as improved prices and reduced DD&A more than offset the volume loss from our Canada
disposition.
The earnings increase was partly offset by additional volume reductions from the disposition of our western Canada gas assets.
Total average production decreased 45 percent in 2017 compared with 2016. The production decrease was primarily due to the
Canada disposition, partly offset by production rampup at Surmont.
Asset Disposition
On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of
our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction was $11.0 billion in cash after customary
adjustments, 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares and a five-year uncapped contingent payment. The contingent payment,
calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million Canadian dollars (CAD) for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly
average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel. During 2018, we recorded gains on dispositions for these contingent payments of
$95 million. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, for additional information.

The Europe and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North
Sea, the Norwegian Sea and Libya. In 2018, our Europe and North Africa operations contributed 19 percent of our worldwide
liquids production and 18 percent of our natural gas production.
2018 vs. 2017
Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $1,866 million increased $1,313 million in 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings in
2018 included a $774 million after-tax gain related to the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our
24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. Earnings were also improved due to higher realized crude
oil and natural gas prices and lower DD&A expense, primarily due to reserve additions.
Average production increased 5 percent in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher production in Libya
and new wells online in Norway and the United Kingdom. These increases in production were partly offset by normal field decline
and the final cessation of production in several producing gas fields in the Southern North Sea in the third quarter of 2018.
Production associated with the Southern North Sea was 22 million cubic feet a day or 4 MBOED in 2018.
Dispositions
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed a transaction to sell a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP, which held 16.5 percent of our
24 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom and acquire their nonoperated interest in the Kuparuk
Assets in Alaska. In 2018, our Europe and North Africa segment net production associated with the disposed 16.5 percent interest
in the Clair Field was approximately 5 MBOED. We recognized a $774 million after-tax gain in the fourth quarter related to this
transaction, as discussed above. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
We are currently marketing our United Kingdom Business Unit.
2017 vs. 2016
Earnings for Europe and North Africa operations of $553 million increased 40 percent in 2017. The increase in earnings was
primarily due to higher realized crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Earnings were additionally improved by lower
DD&A, mainly due to reserve revisions; a $60 million tax benefit from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred taxes at a lower
U.S. federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation; and a $41 million tax benefit in Norway.
The increase in earnings was partly offset by the absence of a 2016 net deferred tax benefit of $161 million resulting from a change
in the U.K. tax rate and a lower credit to impairment in 2017, compared with 2016, reflecting the annual updates to ARO on fields
at or nearing the end of life which were impaired in prior years. The earnings improvement was further reduced by a net deferred
tax charge of $65 million in the U.K. resulting from updated assumptions regarding applicable tax rates.
Average production increased 12 percent in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was mainly due to the resumption and rampup
of production in Libya; improved drilling and well performance in Norway; new production from the Greater Britannia Area and
Norway; and higher Norway gas offtake, partly offset by normal field decline.

The Asia Pacific and Middle East segment has operations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Timor-Leste and Qatar. During
2018, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 60 percent of our natural gas
production.
2018 vs. 2017
Asia Pacific and Middle East reported earnings of $2,070 million in 2018, compared with a loss of $1,098 million in 2017. The
increase in earnings was mainly due to the absence of a $2,384 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our
APLNG investment in 2017, higher realized commodity prices, and increased equity in earnings of affiliates, mainly due to higher
LNG prices. See the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, for information on the 2017 impairment of our APLNG investment.
 
55
Table of Contents
Average production decreased 3 percent in 2018, compared with 2017. The decrease was primarily due to unplanned downtime in
Malaysia related to the rupture of a third-party pipeline which carries gas production from the Kebabangan gas field in Malaysia
and normal field decline. This decrease was partly offset by new wells online at Malakai in Malaysia and an infill drilling program
in China.    
Asset Disposition
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields to the
government of Timor-Leste for $350 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is conditional on the funding
approval from the Timor-Leste government as well as regulatory approvals. No production or reserve impacts are associated with
the sale.
2017 vs. 2016
Asia Pacific and Middle East reported a loss of $1,098 million in 2017, compared with earnings of $209 million in 2016. The
increase in loss was mainly due to a $2,384 million before- and after-tax charge for the impairment of our APLNG investment in
2017. For additional information on our APLNG impairment, see the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-
Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, lower sales volumes in Indonesia, Australia and
China further increased losses.
The increase in losses was partly offset by higher equity earnings, mainly as a result of higher commodity prices, increased sales
volumes at APLNG and the absence of a 2016 deferred tax charge of $174 million resulting from the change of our APLNG tax
functional currency. Higher realized crude oil and natural gas prices on non-equity volumes further reduced the loss.
Average production was essentially flat in 2017.

2018 vs. 2017
Other International operations reported earnings of $364 million in 2018, compared with earnings of $167 million in 2017. The
increase in earnings was primarily due to recognizing $417 million after-tax in other income under a settlement agreement with
PDVSA associated with an arbitration award issued by the ICC. Partly offsetting the increase in earnings, was the absence of a
$320 million after-tax award from an arbitration settlement with The Republic of Ecuador in 2017. See Note 13—Contingencies
and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

We received approval from Argentina’s government in January 2019 for a 50 percent nonoperated interest in the El Turbio Este
block in the Austral Basin.
2017 vs. 2016
Other International operations reported earnings of $167 million in 2017, compared with a loss of $16 million in 2016. The increase
in earnings was primarily due to a $320 million after-tax International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) award
from an arbitration with The Republic of Ecuador. Earnings were additionally increased due to lower rig stacking costs in Angola.
The increase in earnings was partly

offset by the absence of a $138 million gain in 2016 on the disposition of ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our
interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal, and a $45 million tax charge from the revaluation of allocated U.S. deferred
taxes at a lower U.S. federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation.

2018 vs. 2017
Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest decreased
$59 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to less interest from lower debt balances, higher capitalized interest on
projects, and an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the FERC in the first quarter of 2018. Partly offsetting these
impacts, were reduced tax benefits on interest expense following the Tax Legislation, which lowered the U.S. corporate income tax
rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, and a lower tax benefit due to higher interest from the fair market
value method of apportioning interest expense in the United States.
Corporate general and administrative expenses include compensation programs and staff costs. These costs decreased by
$102 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to lower staff expenses and costs associated with certain key employee
compensation programs.
Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues. Activities are focused on
tight oil reservoirs, LNG, oil sands and other production operations. Earnings from Technology increased by $89 million in 2018
compared with 2017, primarily due to higher licensing revenues. See Note 24—Sales and Other Operating Revenues, in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no
longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, premiums incurred on the early retirement of
debt, unrealized holding gains or losses on equity securities, and pension settlement expense. Losses in “Other” decreased by
$219 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to the absence of an $813 million tax charge from the revaluation of
deferred taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation enacted in 2017; lower premiums on the
early retirement of debt; partly offset by a $437 million unrealized loss on our Cenovus Energy common shares.

2017 vs. 2016
Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest decreased
25 percent in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to impacts from the fair market value method of apportioning interest
expense in the United States and lower interest as a result of reduced debt. Higher interest income further drove the decrease in net
interest, which was partly offset by lower capitalized interest on projects.
Corporate general and administrative expenses which include pension settlement expenses and compensation program costs
increased $46 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher costs associated with certain key employee
compensation programs and staff expenses. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Financial Statements,
for additional information.    
Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are
focused on tight oil reservoirs, LNG, oil sands and other production operations. Earnings from Technology were $20 million in
2017, compared with $50 million in 2016. The decrease in earnings primarily resulted from lower licensing revenues, partly offset
by reduced technology program spend.
The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no
longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment and premiums incurred on the early retirement of
debt. Losses in “Other” increased $972 million in 2017, mainly due to an $813 million tax charge from the revaluation of deferred
taxes at a lower federal statutory rate, in accordance with the Tax Legislation and premiums on our early retirement of debt.

    *Capital includes total debt and total equity.
To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from
operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities
using our shelf registration statement. In 2018, the primary uses of our available cash were $6,750 million to support our ongoing
capital expenditures and investments program; $4,995 million to reduce debt; $2,999 million to repurchase our common stock; and
$1,363 million to pay dividends on our common stock. During 2018, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by
$385 million to $6,151 million.
We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described
below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term,
including our capital spending program, share repurchases, dividend payments and required debt payments.
Significant Sources of Capital
Operating Activities
During 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $12,934 million, an 83 percent increase from 2017. The increase was
primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and higher distributions from equity affiliates.
While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term
operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and
margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent
other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash
flows.
The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Full-year production
averaged 1,283 MBOED in 2018. Full-year production excluding Libya averaged 1,242 MBOED in 2018 and is expected to be
1,300 to 1,350 MBOED in 2019. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile
crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production
sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies;
operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition
of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these
factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that
caused by commodity prices.
 
59
Table of Contents
To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our proved
reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. In 2018, our reserve replacement, which included a net
increase of 0.2 billion BOE from sales and purchases, was 147 percent. Increased crude oil reserves accounted for over 90 percent
of the total change in reserves. Our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was
109 percent in 2018. Approximately 33 percent of organic reserve additions are from Lower 48 unconventional assets, 29 percent
from Alaska and 22 percent from Asia Pacific and Middle East.
In the five years ended December 31, 2018, our reserve replacement, which included a decrease of 2.1 billion BOE from sales and
purchases, was negative 30 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period. Our organic
reserve replacement during the five years ended December 31, 2018, was 44 percent, reflecting development activities as well as
lower prices during that period.    
Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as
shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our 2019 capital budget, see the “2019
Capital Budget” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and for additional information on proved reserves, including
both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of this report.
As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each
year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data
becomes available on reservoirs. In 2018 and 2017, revisions increased reserves, while in 2016, revisions decreased reserves. It is
not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
Investing Activities
Proceeds from asset sales in 2018 were $1.1 billion. We completed several undeveloped acreage transactions in our Lower 48
segment for a total of $267 million after customary adjustments and another transaction in our Lower 48 segment for $112 million
after customary adjustments. We completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after
customary adjustments. We also received $253 million net proceeds for customary adjustments related to our transaction with BP
for the disposition of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary holding a 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field in the United Kingdom and the
acquisition of the Kuparuk Assets. We received contingent payments of $95 million in relation to our 2017 Canada disposition to
Cenovus Energy.
Proceeds from asset sales in 2017 were $13.9 billion. We completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL
Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction included
$11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments and 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares. We completed the sale of our
interests in the San Juan Basin to an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. Total proceeds for the sale were $2.5 billion in cash after
customary adjustments. We also completed the sale of our interest in the Panhandle assets for $178 million in cash after customary
adjustments.
For additional information on our dispositions and investment in Cenovus common shares, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold
or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions and Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, and the Results of Operations section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities
In May 2018, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.75 billion to $6.0 billion
with a new expiration date of May 2023. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of
letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly
syndicated among financial institutions
 
60
Table of Contents
and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or
credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other
debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank
market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States.
The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights
if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
The revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips Company $6.0 billion commercial paper program which is primarily a
funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We had no
commercial paper outstanding in programs in place at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. We had no direct outstanding
borrowings or letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Since we had no
commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in borrowing capacity under our
revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018.
In August 2018, Fitch upgraded our long-term debt rating from “A-” to “A” and adjusted their outlook for our debt from “positive”
to “stable.” In September 2018, Moody’s Investors Services upgraded its rating on our long-term debt from “Baa1” to “A3” and
adjusted its outlook for our debt from “positive” to “stable.” In November 2018, Standard & Poor’s upgraded our long-term debt
rating from “A-” to “A,” with a stable outlook. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause
an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating
were downgraded, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper
markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would
still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post
collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31,
2018 and 2017, we had direct bank letters of credit of $323 million and $338 million, respectively, which secured performance
obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of credit ratings
downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
Shelf Registration
We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we,
as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity
securities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous
agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed
by the agreements.
For information about guarantees, see Note 12—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Our debt balance at December 31, 2018, was $15.0 billion, a decrease of $4.7 billion from the balance at December 31, 2017. We
achieved our stated debt target of $15 billion eighteen months earlier than the original target date of year-end 2019.
In 2018, we repaid the $250 million floating rate note due in 2018 at its natural maturity. We also redeemed or repurchased a total
$4,450 million of debt, described below, incurring $208 million in net premiums above book value, which are reported in the
“Other expenses” line on our consolidated income statement.

On February 1, 2018, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.285 per share, compared with the previous quarterly
dividend of $0.265 per share. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on
February 12, 2018. On May 4, 2018, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.285 per share. The dividend was paid on June 1,
2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2018. On July 11, 2018, we announced a quarterly dividend of
$0.285 per share. The dividend was paid on September 4, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2018.
On October 5, 2018, we announced a 7 percent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.305 per share. The dividend was paid on
December 3, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2018. On January 30, 2019, we announced a
quarterly dividend of $0.305 cents per share, payable March 1, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February
11, 2019.
In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2018, we had announced authorization to repurchase
a total of $6 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $3 billion in 2017 and $3 billion in 2018. On July 12, 2018, we
announced an authorization of an additional $9 billion in share repurchases bringing the total program authorization to $15 billion.
We expect to execute $3 billion of the remaining $9 billion of our share repurchase program in 2019. Whether we undertake these
additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, market conditions and other factors. See Risk Factors “Our
ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations.”
Since our share repurchase program began in November 2016, we have repurchased 111 million shares at a cost of $6.1 billion
through December 31, 2018.
During the third quarter of 2017, we made a $600 million contribution to our domestic qualified pension plan, which is included in
the “Other” line in the “Cash Flows From Operating Activities” section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. This additional
contribution lowered our domestic pension deficit, thereby reducing 2018 premiums charged by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation.

Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, totaled $16.2 billion. The 2018
expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily:
 
 • Development, appraisal and exploration activities in the Lower 48, including Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware in the
Permian Basin.
 • Leasehold acquisition and exploration, appraisal and development activities in Alaska related to the Western North
Slope; development activities in the Greater Kuparuk Area and the Greater Prudhoe Area.
 • Development activities in Europe, including the Greater Ekofisk Area, Clair Ridge and Aasta Hansteen.
 • Leasehold acquisition, optimization of oil sands development and appraisal activities in liquids-rich plays in Canada.
 • Continued development in China, Australia, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and exploration and appraisal activities in
Malaysia.
2019 CAPITAL BUDGET
In December 2018, we announced a 2019 capital budget of $6.1 billion which includes funding for ongoing conventional and
unconventional development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, and base maintenance
activities. We are planning to allocate approximately:
 
 • 70 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to development drilling programs. These funds will focus
predominantly on the Lower 48 unconventionals including the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware, as well as
development drilling in Alaska, Canada and Europe.
 • 15 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to maintain base production and corporate expenditures.
 • 10 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to major projects. These funds will focus on major projects in Alaska,
China, Australia, Europe and Malaysia.
 • 5 percent of our 2019 capital expenditures budget to new exploration activity, primarily in Alaska and the Lower 48.

Contingencies
A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against
ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal
or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need
for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to
income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be
reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is
accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for
probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative
probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures
will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. For
information on other contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax
payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property
damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and
privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend
ourselves vigorously in these matters.
Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases,
employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the
early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that
have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation
management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses
the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
See Note 19—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income
tax-related contingencies.
Environmental
We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies
in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
 
 • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.
 • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
 • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).
 • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which
imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance
releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
 • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of
solid waste.
 
65
Table of Contents
 • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines,
lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for
removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.
 • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic
chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
 • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
 • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose
liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
 • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.
These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water
quality limits and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous
wastes. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an
applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time
consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the
application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations
governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent,
requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as
new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and
regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an
increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential
impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada.
An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas
otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently
govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic
fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under
consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could
result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.
Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural
gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed
government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and
past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are
subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies
alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made
a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by
 
66
Table of Contents
private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are
not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2018, there were 14 sites
around the United States in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws.
For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage
of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of
those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially
responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they
have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of
the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to
actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate
remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur
after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and
given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all
CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
Expensed environmental costs were $442 million in 2018 and are expected to be about $530 million per year in 2019 and 2020.
Capitalized environmental costs were $191 million in 2018 and are expected to be about $240 million per year in 2019 and 2020.
Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not
discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain
investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-
generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental
remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. The laws that
require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities
or the current ownership or control of sites. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party
recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.
Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics,
evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of
potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
At December 31, 2018, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $178 million, compared with $180 million
at December 31, 2017, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these
expenditures within the next 30 years.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and
liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will
not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial
position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
Climate Change
Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or
promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction.
 
67
Table of Contents
These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future.
Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our
future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations
and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
 
 • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member
states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2018 was approximately
$5.6 million (net share before-tax).
 • The Alberta Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation (CCIR) requires any existing facility with emissions equal to
or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet an industry benchmark intensity.
The total cost of these regulations in 2018 was approximately $4 million.
 • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA
has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.
 • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants
Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S.
Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs
under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review
time for development projects.
 • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and
smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry. The former U.S. administration
established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by
2025.
 • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2018 was
approximately $30 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in
our British Columbia and Alberta Operations totaling just over $0.6 million (net share before-tax).
 • The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
on Climate Change, setting out a new process for achieving global emission reductions. While the United States
announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, there is no guarantee that the commitments made by the
United States will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by U.S. state and local governments or by major corporations
headquartered in the United States.
In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect
to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of
taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or
trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and
energy conservation throughout our operations.
Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could
significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and
increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources,
including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of
factors, including but not limited to:
 
 • Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.
 • The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.
 • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation.
 • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
 
68
Table of Contents
 • The GHG reductions required.
 • The price and availability of offsets.
 • The amount and allocation of allowances.
 • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
 • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea
levels and changes in temperature).
 • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and
services.
The company has responded by putting in place a Sustainable Development Risk Management Practice covering the assessment
and registering of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence. A
corporate Climate Change Action Plan has been developed to track mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the
corporate Sustainable Development Risk Register.
The risks addressed in our Climate Change Action Plan fall into four broad categories:
 
 • GHG-related legislation and regulation.
 • GHG emissions management.
 • Physical climate-related impacts.
 • Climate-related disclosure and reporting.
The company uses a range of estimated future costs of GHG emissions for internal planning purposes, including an estimated
market cost of GHG emissions of $40 per metric tonne applied beginning in the year 2024 to evaluate certain future projects and
opportunities. The company does not use an estimated market cost of GHG emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions
without existing GHG regulations.
In December 2018, we became a Founding Member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute
founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan. Participation in the CLC
provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our public policy
principles. We also belong to and fund Americans for Carbon Dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the CLC.
In 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, a state government, and a trade association in California, New York, Washington, Rhode Island
and Maryland, as well as the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Association, Inc., have filed lawsuits against oil and gas
companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.
ConocoPhillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuits. The lawsuits brought by the Cities of San Francisco, Oakland and
New York have been dismissed by the district courts and appeals are pending.
Other
We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances
have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our
historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net
deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, “Leases” (ASU No. 2016-02), which
establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements. This ASU supersedes the
existing requirements in FASB ASC Topic 840, “Leases” (FASB ASC Topic 840), and requires lessees to recognize substantially all
lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 also modify the definition of a lease and
outline requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors.
The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption of the standard is
permitted. Entities are required to adopt the ASU using a modified retrospective approach, subject to certain optional practical
expedients, and apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements.
ASU No. 2016-02 was amended in January 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for
Transition to Topic 842” (ASU No. 2018-01), and in July 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification
Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” (ASU No. 2018-10). In addition, ASU No. 2016-02 was further amended in July 2018 by the
provisions of ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (ASU No. 2018-11), and in December 2018 by the provisions of ASU
No. 2018-20, “Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors” (ASU No. 2018-20).
ASU No. 2018-11 sets forth certain additional practical expedients for lessors and provides entities with an option to apply the
provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the ASU’s effective date of
adoption (the “Optional Transition Method”). Entities that elect to utilize the Optional Transition Method would not apply the
provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, to comparative periods presented in the financial statements.
We plan to adopt ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019, utilizing the Optional Transition Method. Accordingly,
the comparative periods presented in the financial statements prior to January 1, 2019, will be presented pursuant to the existing
requirements of FASB ASC Topic 840 and not be adjusted upon the adoption of the ASU. We also expect to utilize the package of
optional transition-related practical expedients set forth by ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, which permit entities to not reassess
upon the adoption of the ASU certain historical conclusions regarding lease contract identification and classification, as well as the
historical accounting treatment of initial direct costs (the “Package of Optional Practical Expedients”). For lease arrangements
containing both lease and non-lease components, we will adopt the optional practical expedient to not separate lease components
from non-lease components for all new or modified leases executed on or after the effective date of the ASU, subject to making any
elections for leases after the effective date in new asset classes. Furthermore, we do not expect to record assets and liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheet for new or existing lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less.
The expected impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, relates primarily to our balance sheet, resulting from the
initial recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for our existing population of operating leases, as well as
enhanced disclosure of our leasing arrangements. We expect to recognize on our consolidated balance sheet approximately
$1 billion of operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended.
We have implemented a third-party lease accounting software solution to facilitate the ongoing accounting and financial reporting
requirements of the ASU and also expect the adoption of the ASU to result in certain changes being made to our existing
accounting policies and systems, business processes, and internal controls.    
While our evaluation of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, and related implementation activities approach completion, we continue to
monitor proposals issued by the FASB to clarify the ASU. For additional information, see Note 26—New Accounting Standards, in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of
our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a
reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions
had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at
least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies
and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting
estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain
matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
Oil and Gas Accounting
Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The
acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred,
similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are
capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the
prospect.
Property Acquisition Costs
For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts
to date. For relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage
probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others
in the geographic area. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of
ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and
that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is
reported in exploration expense.
This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on
favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization
expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2018, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are
relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $468 million and the
accumulated impairment reserve was $153 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure
was approximately 71 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately two years. If that judgmental
percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, before-tax leasehold impairment expense in 2019 would increase
by approximately $7 million. At year-end 2018, the remaining $3.6 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted
primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently
being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $2.6 billion is concentrated in
10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2019. Management
periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and
the outlook for commercialization.
Exploratory Costs
For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of
whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.
 
71
Table of Contents
If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet
as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The
accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of
suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make
the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is
dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.
Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be
obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the
oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory
wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on
the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental
permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are
expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and
seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further
investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and
hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms,
regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment.
At year-end 2018, total suspended well costs were $856 million, compared with $853 million at year-end 2017. For additional
information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Proved Reserves
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts
because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering
assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors,
installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on
both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates
due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations.
There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be
designated as “proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent
with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved
reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.    
Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into
account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the
estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and
current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost
levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices
decline and increase as prices rise.
 
72
Table of Contents
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, reported under the “economic interest”
method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses;
and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in
commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices
decline.
The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve
estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that
asset. At year-end 2018, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production
calculation was approximately $37 billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2018 was approximately $5.5 billion. The
estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.0 billion BOE at the end of 2017 and 3.3 billion BOE
at the end of 2018. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent
across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2018 would have increased by an estimated $611 million.
Impairments
Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible
significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter
following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as
prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is
less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are
grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and
production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is
typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with
those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market
transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value
calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital
decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount
of an impairment in any period. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional
information.
Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence
of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include
our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment
amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than
temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair
value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of
time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our
investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since
quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows
using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable
assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an
investment in any period. See the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs
Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the
land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and
abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production
facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a
liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset
removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and
regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually
occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs
into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the
remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which
we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings,
because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair
value of these properties.
In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain
environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within
the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they
are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such
remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See
Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.
Projected Benefit Obligations
Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the
recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The
actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain
future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of
return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the
specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit
obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-governed pension plans, the
actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in
determining required company contributions into the plans. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial
accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and
assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits
under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions
used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit
obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would
increase projected benefit obligations by $1,000 million. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on
plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by
$110 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by
$40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated
benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans
during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated
recognition of a portion of unrecognized net

actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict.
In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or elimination for a
significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services, we could recognize a
curtailment gain or loss. See Note 18—Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional
information.
Contingencies
A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises
judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with
environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess
our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and
potential exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or
other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual
terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs
related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the
administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within
“Capital Resources and Liquidity.”

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference
in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected
revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples
of forward-looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business
environment generally, our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can
often identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,”
“intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,”
“goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions.
We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries
in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve
assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In
addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate.
Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking
statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
 • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, including a prolonged decline in
these prices relative to historical or future expected levels.
 • The impact of significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, which may
result in recognition of impairment costs on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments.
 • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas
developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and
reservoir performance.
 • Reductions in reserves replacement rates, whether as a result of the significant declines in commodity prices or
otherwise.
 • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage.
 • Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and
production facilities.
 • Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of
global climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal.
 • Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural
gas liquids.
 • Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction, drilling and/or development, or
inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or
regulations.
 • Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to complete construction of, announced and
future exploration and production and LNG development in a timely manner (if at all) or on budget.
 • Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political
events, war, terrorism, cyber attacks, and information technology failures, constraints or disruptions.
 • Changes in international monetary conditions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
 
76
Table of Contents
 • Changes in international trade relationships, including the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs relating to crude oil,
bitumen, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids and any materials or products (such as aluminum and steel) used in the
operation of our business.
 • Reduced demand for our products or the use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources.
 • Substantial investment in and development of alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or future
environmental rules and regulations.
 • Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations.
 • Liability resulting from litigation or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 • General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of
assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids pricing,
regulation or taxation; the impact of and uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s decision to withdraw from the
European Union; and other political, economic or diplomatic developments.
 • Volatility in the commodity futures markets.
 • Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our
business, including changes resulting from the implementation and interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
 • Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.
 • Any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital, including as a result of illiquidity or uncertainty
in domestic or international financial markets.
 • Our inability to execute, or delays in the completion, of any asset dispositions or acquisitions we elect to pursue.
 • Potential failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, any necessary regulatory approvals for asset dispositions or
acquisitions or that such approvals may require modification to the terms of the transactions or the operation of our
remaining business.
 • Potential disruption of our operations as a result of asset dispositions or acquisitions, including the diversion of
management time and attention.
 • Our inability to deploy the net proceeds from any asset dispositions we undertake in the manner and timeframe we
currently anticipate, if at all.
 • Our inability to liquidate the common stock issued to us by Cenovus Energy as part of our sale of certain assets in
western Canada at prices we deem acceptable, or at all.
 • The operation and financing of our joint ventures.
 • The ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us, including our inability
to collect payments when due under our ICC settlement agreement with PDVSA.
 • Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and expenditure reductions.
 • The factors generally described in Item 1A—Risk Factors in this 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and any additional
risks described in our other filings with the SEC.

Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Financial Instrument Market Risk
We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or
earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-
based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products;
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.
Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that
prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations
document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk
and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial
marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.
Commodity Price Risk
Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:
 
 • Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to
convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.
 • Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable
locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these
activities.
We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes
in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including
commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018, as derivative instruments. Using
Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held
for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2018 and 2017, was immaterial to our consolidated
cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips.
Interest Rate Risk
The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The
debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.
Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt
approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Fair value   $21,402    $1,033   
  
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the
exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate
exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net
investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and
foreign currency exchange swaps and options for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards,
swaps and options hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the
change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding foreign currency zero-cost collars buying the right to sell $1.25 billion
Canadian dollars (CAD) at $0.707 CAD and selling the right to buy $1.25 billion CAD at $0.842 CAD against the U.S.
dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was a before-tax gain of $6 million and a before-tax loss of $9 million,
respectively. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2018 and December 2017 exchange rate, this
would result in an additional before-tax loss of $17 million and $74 million respectively. The sensitivity analysis is based on
changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in
some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Report of Management
Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing in this
annual report. The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash
flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial
statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under
the circumstances. The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders.
Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the
minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings.
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’
internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In
making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we believe the company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.
Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018,
and their report is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ConocoPhillips
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the
related consolidated income statement, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes, condensed consolidating financial
information listed in the Index at Item 8, and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), ConocoPhillips’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of ConocoPhillips’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
ConocoPhillips’ financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to ConocoPhillips in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ConocoPhillips
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited ConocoPhillips’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated income statement,
consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2018, and the related notes, condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at Item 8, and financial
statement schedule listed in Item 15(a) of ConocoPhillips and our report dated February 19, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
Basis for Opinion
ConocoPhillips’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading “Assessment of Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting” in the accompanying “Report of Management.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on ConocoPhillips’
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to ConocoPhillips in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   ConocoPhillips
Note 1—Accounting Policies
 
∎ Consolidation Principles and Investments—Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned,
controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. The equity method is used to
account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates’ operating
and financial policies. When we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, the investment is measured at fair value
except when the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value. For those exceptions, it will be measured at cost
minus impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the
same issuer. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a
proportionate basis. Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.
We manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48, Canada, Europe
and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. For additional information, see Note 25—Segment
Disclosures and Related Information.
 
∎ Foreign Currency Translation—Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial
statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in common stockholders’ equity.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Some of our foreign operations use their local
currency as the functional currency.
 
∎ Use of Estimates—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
∎ Revenue Recognition—Revenues associated with the sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquified natural gas (LNG),
natural gas liquids and other items are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset. In
evaluating when a customer has control of the asset, we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical
delivery has occurred, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership, and whether the customer has
accepted delivery and a right to payment exists. These products are typically sold at prevailing market prices. We allocate
variable market-based consideration to deliveries (performance obligations) in the current period as that consideration relates
specifically to our efforts to transfer control of current period deliveries to the customer and represents the amount we expect
to be entitled to in exchange for the related products. Payment is typically due within 30 days or less.
Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with
the same counterparty are entered into “in contemplation” of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same
income statement line).
 
∎ Shipping and Handling Costs—We typically incur shipping and handling costs prior to control transferring to the customer
and account for these activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, we include shipping and handling costs in production and
operating expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in purchased
commodities. Freight costs billed to customers are treated as a component of the transaction price and recorded as a
component of revenue when the customer obtains control.
 
∎ Cash Equivalents—Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts
of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued
interest, which approximates fair value.
 
90
Table of Contents
∎ Short-Term Investments—Investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government
obligations) with original maturities of greater than 90 days but less than one year are classified as short-term investments.
 
∎ Inventories—We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following
methods for each type of inventory. Our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost primarily using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) basis. We measure these inventories at the lower-of-cost-or-market in the aggregate. Any necessary
lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used
to better match current inventory costs with current revenues. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in
bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and
development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are
valued using various methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method,
consistent with industry practice.
 
∎ Fair Value Measurements—Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value
hierarchy are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the
measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are
observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
through market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant
modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.
 
∎ Derivative Instruments—Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists
and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet
and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends
on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are
recognized immediately in earnings.
 
∎ Oil and Gas Exploration and Development—Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the
successful efforts method of accounting.
Property Acquisition Costs—Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet
caption properties, plants and equipment (PP&E). Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and
management’s judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the
associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.
Exploratory Costs—Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are
expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet pending further
evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not
found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of
oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to
have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal
drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of
development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the
projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
 
91
Table of Contents
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal
drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not
warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 8—Suspended Wells and Other Exploration Expenses, for additional
information on suspended wells.
Development Costs—Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are
capitalized.
Depletion and Amortization—Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method
based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the
unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.
 
∎ Capitalized Interest—Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period
of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of
the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.
 
∎ Depreciation and Amortization—Depreciation and amortization of PP&E on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain
pipeline and LNG assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the
unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other PP&E are determined by either the individual-unit-
straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).
 
∎ Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment—PP&E used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever
changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be
generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is
an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an
established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are
reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group,
the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provisions and
reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made. Individual assets are grouped for
impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there
usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based
on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal
market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets
where possible. Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of
amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or
present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.
The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future
production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review. The impairment review includes
cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve
that production. Additionally, when probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves
may be included in the impairment calculation.
 
92
Table of Contents
∎ Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities—Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for
impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred and annually following
updates to corporate planning assumptions. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the
carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted
market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be
consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee,
if appropriate.
 
∎ Maintenance and Repairs—Costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when
incurred.
 
∎ Property Dispositions—When complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the “Gain on dispositions” line of our consolidated income
statement. When less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired which do not significantly alter the
depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rate, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or
credited to accumulated depreciation.
 
∎ Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs—The fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-
lived assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the
production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the
related PP&E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the
liability and PP&E. Over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in PP&E is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Reductions to estimated liabilities for assets that are no longer producing
are recorded as a credit to impairment, if the asset had been previously impaired, or as a credit to DD&A, if the asset had not
been previously impaired. For additional information, see Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued
Environmental Costs.
Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures relating
to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for
environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination,
which we record on a discounted basis) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their
receipt is probable and estimable.
 
∎ Guarantees—The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The
initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee
liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee.
In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is
essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over
time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When
it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable,
based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure
under the guarantee.
 
∎ Share-Based Compensation—We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e.,
the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when
an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the
service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
 
93
Table of Contents
∎ Income Taxes—Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and
temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain
foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the
provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.
 
∎ Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities—Sales and value-added taxes are recorded
net.
 
∎ Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock—Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated based
upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Also, this calculation includes fully
vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock, along with an adjustment to net income (loss) for
dividend equivalents paid on unvested unit awards that are considered participating securities. Diluted net income per share of
common stock includes unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but
unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share, primarily under the treasury-
stock method. Diluted net loss per share, which is calculated the same as basic net loss per share, does not assume conversion
or exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. The earnings per share impact of the participating securities is
immaterial.
Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles
We adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” and its amendments issued by the provisions of ASU No. 2016-08, “Principal versus
Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),” ASU No. 2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing,” ASU No. 2016-12, “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” and ASU No. 2016-20, “Technical
Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers,” collectively Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (ASC Topic 606) beginning January 1, 2018. ASC
Topic 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for an entity to use in accounting for revenue arising from all contracts with
customers except where revenues are in scope of another accounting standard. The ASU superseded the revenue recognition
requirements in ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and most industry-specific guidance. ASC Topic 606 sets forth a five-step
model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity is required to recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those
goods and services. ASC Topic 606 also requires certain additional revenue-related disclosures. The adoption of ASC Topic 606 did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 24—Sales and Other Operating Revenues for
additional information related to this ASC.
We adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities,” (ASU
No. 2016-01) beginning January 1, 2018. The ASU, among other things, requires an entity to record the changes in fair value of
equity investments, other than investments accounted for using the equity method, within net income. Under this ASU, an entity is
no longer able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities in other comprehensive income and instead
must recognize them in the income statement. See Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy and Note 20—Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss for additional information relating to this ASU.

For discussion of adjustments for ASU No. 2016-01 and ASC Topic 606, see Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy and Note 24—Sales and Other Operating
Revenues, respectively.
We adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost,” beginning January 1, 2018. We retrospectively applied the presentation of service cost separate from
the other components of net periodic costs. The interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service
cost/credit, recognized net actuarial loss/gain, settlement expense, curtailment loss/gain, and special termination benefits have been
reclassified from the “Production and operating expenses,” “Selling, general and administrative expenses,” and “Exploration
expenses” lines to the “Other expenses” line on our consolidated income statement. We elected to apply the practical expedient
which allows us to reclassify amounts disclosed previously in the employee benefit plans footnote as the basis for applying
retrospective presentation for prior comparative periods as it is impracticable to determine the disaggregation of the cost
components for amounts capitalized and amortized in those periods. On a prospective basis, the other components of net periodic
benefit costs will not be included in amounts capitalized in inventory or PP&E.
The effect of the retrospective presentation change related to the net periodic benefit cost of our defined benefit pension and other
postretirement employee benefits plans on our consolidated income statement was as follows:

Table of Contents
We adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” beginning
January 1, 2018. This ASU clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified and presented in the
statement of cash flows. We have made an accounting policy election to classify distributions received from equity method
investees using the nature of the distribution approach which classifies distributions received from investees as either cash inflows
from operating activities or cash inflows from investing activities in the statement of cash flows based on the nature of the activities
of the investee that generated the distribution. The impact of adopting this ASU was not material to prior presented periods.
We adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2016-18, “Restricted Cash,” beginning January 1, 2018. This ASU requires amounts
deemed restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period
total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows, and presentation should permit a reconciliation when cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash are presented in more than one line item on the balance sheet. We have amounts deposited in statutory bank
accounts in certain countries to satisfy asset retirement obligations (ARO). These amounts are deemed restricted cash and are
included in the “Other assets” line of our consolidated balance sheet. This standard is required to be applied retrospectively to all
periods presented, but the impact in those periods was not material.
Note 3—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary.
Information on our significant VIEs follows:
Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG)
APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of
subordinated financial support. We are not the primary beneficiary of APLNG because we share with Origin Energy and China
Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) the power to direct the key activities of APLNG that most significantly impact its economic
performance, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of coalbed methane, as well as LNG
processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate APLNG, and it is accounted for as an equity method
investment.
As of December 31, 2018, we have not provided any financial support to APLNG other than amounts previously contractually
required. Unless we elect otherwise, we have no requirement to provide liquidity or purchase the assets of APLNG. See Note 6—
Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 12—Guarantees, for additional information.
Marine Well Containment Company, LLC (MWCC)
MWCC provides well containment equipment and technology and related services in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Its
principal activities involve the development and maintenance of rapid-response hydrocarbon well containment systems that are
deployable in the Gulf of Mexico on a call-out basis. We have a 10 percent ownership interest in MWCC, and it is accounted for as
an equity method investment because MWCC is a limited liability company in which we are a Founding Member and exercise
significant influence through our permanent seat on the ten-member Executive Committee responsible for overseeing the affairs of
MWCC. In 2016, MWCC executed a $154 million term loan financing arrangement with an external financial institution whose
terms required the financing be secured by letters of credit provided by certain owners of MWCC, including ConocoPhillips. In
connection with the financing transaction, we issued a letter of credit of $22 million which can be drawn upon in the event of a
default by MWCC on its obligation to repay the proceeds of the term loan. The fair value of this letter of credit is immaterial and
not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet. MWCC is considered a VIE, as it has entered into arrangements that provide it
with additional forms of subordinated financial support. We are not the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate MWCC because
we share the power to govern the business and operation of the company and to undertake certain obligations that most
significantly impact its economic performance with nine other unaffiliated owners of MWCC.
 
96
Table of Contents
At December 31, 2018, the book value of our equity method investment in MWCC was $130 million. We have not provided any
financial support to MWCC other than amounts previously contractually required. Unless we elect otherwise, we have no
requirement to provide liquidity or purchase the assets of MWCC.
Note 4—Inventories
Inventories at December 31 were:
 
   Millions of Dollars 
     
   2018    2017 
     
Crude oil and natural gas   $ 432    512 
Materials and supplies    575    548 
  
  $        1,007            1,060 
  
Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $292 million and $341 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The
estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories was approximately $75 million and $124 million at
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In 2018, liquidation of LIFO inventory values decreased the net income
attributable to ConocoPhillips by $6 million.
Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions
Assets Held for Sale
In 2018, we signed a definitive agreement to sell an office building for $90 million, and the held for sale criteria were met in the
fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the building had a carrying value of $90 million which we reclassified to
“Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheet. The transaction closed in January 2019. The
building is included in our Corporate and other segment.
2018
Assets Sold
All gains or losses on asset dispositions are reported before-tax and are included net in the “Gain on dispositions” line on our
consolidated income statement. All cash proceeds are included in the “Cash Flows From Investing Activities” section of our
consolidated statement of cash flows.
In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of certain properties in the Lower 48 segment for net proceeds of $112 million.
No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. In the second quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of a package of largely
undeveloped acreage in the Lower 48 segment for net proceeds of $105 million and no gain or loss was recognized on the sale. In
the third quarter of 2018, we completed a noncash exchange of undeveloped acreage in the Lower 48 segment. The transaction was
recorded at fair value resulting in the recognition of a $56 million gain. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold several packages of
undeveloped acreage in the Lower 48 segment for total net proceeds of $162 million and recognized gains of approximately
$140 million.
On October 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Barnett to Lime Rock Resources for $196 million after
customary adjustments and recognized a loss of $5 million. We recorded impairments of $87 million in 2018 and $572 million in
2017 to reduce the net carrying value of the Barnett to fair value. At the time of the disposition, our interest in Barnett had a net
carrying value of $201 million, consisting
 
97
Table of Contents
of $250 million of PP&E and $49 million of AROs. The before-tax losses associated with our interests in the Barnett, including
both the impairments and loss on disposition noted above, were $59 million, $566 million and $66 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Barnett results of operations are included in our Lower 48 segment.
On December 18, 2018, we completed the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP. The subsidiary held a 16.5 percent interest in
the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. We retained a 7.5 percent interest in the field. At the same time, we acquired
BP’s 39.2 percent nonoperated interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area in Alaska, including their 38 percent interest in the Kuparuk
Transportation Company (Kuparuk Assets). The transaction was recorded at a fair value of $1,743 million and was cash neutral
except for customary adjustments which resulted in net proceeds of $253 million. At closing, our 16.5 percent interest in the Clair
Field had a net carrying value of approximately $1,028 million consisting primarily of $1,553 million of PP&E, $485 million of
deferred tax liabilities, and $59 million of AROs. We recognized a before-tax gain of $715 million on the transaction. The 2018
before-tax earnings associated with our 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field, including the recognized gain, were $748 million.
The before-tax losses associated with our 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field were $0.4 million and $8 million for the years
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Results of operations for our interest in the Clair Field are reported within our
Europe and North Africa segment and the Kuparuk Assets are included in our Alaska segment.
Other Planned Dispositions
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our 30 percent interest in Greater Sunrise Fields to the
government of Timor-Leste for $350 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is conditional on the funding
approval from the Timor-Leste government as well as regulatory approvals. The Greater Sunrise Fields are included in our Asia
Pacific and Middle East segment.
In January 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our 12.4 percent ownership interests in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and
Golden Pass Pipeline located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal
and pipeline capacity are used for receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company
Limited (QG3) and transportation of the regasified natural gas. As a result of entering into these agreements, we expect to recognize
a loss of approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2019. We have also entered into agreements to amend our contractual
obligations for retaining use of the facilities. Completion of the sale is subject to regulatory approval.                
Acquisitions
In May 2018, we completed the acquisition of Anadarko’s 22 percent nonoperated interest in the Western North Slope of Alaska, as
well as its interest in the Alpine Transportation Pipeline for $386 million, after customary adjustments. This transaction was
accounted for as a business combination resulting in the recognition of approximately $297 million of proved property and
$114 million of unproved property within PP&E, $20 million of inventory, $14 million of investments, and $59 million of AROs.
These assets are included in our Alaska segment.
As discussed in the Clair Field transaction with BP above, we acquired BP’s Kuparuk Assets on December 18, 2018. The
transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition with a net acquisition cost of $1,490 million, comprised of the fair value of
$1,743 million associated with the disposed 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field, reduced by the net proceeds of $253 million.
Accordingly, we recorded approximately $1.9 billion to proved property within PP&E, $42 million to inventory, $15 million to
investments, $374 million of asset retirement obligations, and a $100 million decrease to net working capital. The Kuparuk Assets
are included in our Alaska segment.
2017
On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the Foster Creek Christina Lake (FCCL)
Partnership, as well as the majority of our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction was
$11.0 billion in cash after customary adjustments, 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares and a five-year uncapped
contingent payment. The value of the shares at closing was
 
98
Table of Contents
$1.96 billion based on a price of $9.41 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. The contingent payment, calculated and paid on
a quarterly basis, is $6 million Canadian dollars (CAD) for every $1 CAD by which the Western Canada Select (WCS) quarterly
average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel. Contingent payments received during the five-year period are reflected as “Gain
on dispositions” on our consolidated income statement. We reported before-tax equity earnings associated with FCCL of
$197 million and $89 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We reported before-tax losses of
$26 million and $572 million for the western Canada gas producing properties for the same periods, respectively.    In 2018, we
recorded a gain on dispositions for these contingent payments of $95 million.
At closing, the carrying value of our equity investment in FCCL was $8.9 billion. The carrying value of our interest in the western
Canada gas assets was $1.9 billion consisting primarily of $2.6 billion of PP&E, partly offset by AROs of $585 million and
approximately $100 million of environmental and other accruals. A gain of $2.1 billion was included in the “Gain on dispositions”
line on our consolidated income statement in 2017. Both FCCL and the western Canada gas assets were reported in our Canada
segment.
For more information on the Canada disposition and our investment in Cenovus Energy see Note 7—Investment in Cenovus
Energy, Note 15—Fair Value Measurement, and Note 20—Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.
In July 2017, we completed the sale of our interests in the San Juan Basin to an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company for
$2.5 billion in cash after customary adjustments and recognized a loss on disposition of $22 million. The transaction includes a
contingent payment of up to $300 million. The six-year contingent payment, effective beginning January 1, 2018, is due annually
for the periods in which the monthly U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per million British thermal units. In 2018, we
recorded a gain on dispositions for these contingent payments of $28 million. In the second quarter of 2017, we recorded an
impairment of $3.3 billion to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the San Juan Basin to fair value. At the time of
disposition, the San Juan Basin interests had a net carrying value of approximately $2.5 billion, consisting of $2.9 billion of PP&E
and $406 million of liabilities, primarily AROs. The before-tax losses associated with our interests in the San Juan Basin, including
both the $3.3 billion impairment and $22 million loss on disposition noted above, were $3.2 billion and $239 million for the years
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The San Juan Basin results were reported in our Lower 48 segment.
In September 2017, we completed the sale of our interest in the Panhandle assets for $178 million in cash after customary
adjustments, and recognized a loss on disposition of $28 million. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interest
was $206 million, consisting primarily of $279 million of PP&E and $72 million of AROs. Including the $28 million loss on
disposition noted above, we reported before-tax losses for the Panhandle properties of $14 million and $21 million for the years
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Panhandle results were reported in our Lower 48 segment.
2016
In April 2016, we sold our interest in the Alaska Beluga River Unit natural gas field in the Cook Inlet for $134 million, net of
settlement of gas imbalances and customary adjustments, and recognized a gain on disposition of $56 million. At the time of
disposition, the net carrying value of our Beluga River Unit interest, which was included in the Alaska segment, was $78 million,
consisting primarily of $100 million of PP&E and $19 million of AROs.
In October 2016, we completed an asset exchange with Bonavista Energy in which we gave up approximately 141,000 net acres of
noncore developed properties in central Alberta in exchange for approximately 40,000 net acres of primarily undeveloped
properties in northeast British Columbia. The fair value of the transaction was determined to be approximately $69 million and an
impairment of $57 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2016 when the assets were considered held for sale, to reduce the
carrying value to fair value. A loss on disposition of approximately $1 million was recognized upon completion of the transaction.
The divested properties were included in the Canada segment.

Table of Contents
Also in October 2016, we sold ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., the entity that held our 35 percent interest in three exploration blocks
offshore Senegal for $442 million and recognized a gain on disposition of $146 million. At the time of disposition, the carrying
value of our interest was $286 million, which was primarily PP&E. Senegal results of operations were reported within our Other
International segment.
In November 2016, we completed the sale of our 40 percent interest in South Natuna Sea Block B for $225 million and recognized
a loss on disposition of $26 million. Our interest in Block B was included in the Asia Pacific and Middle East segment. In 2016, we
recognized an impairment of $42 million at the time it was considered held for sale to reduce the carrying value to fair value. At the
time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interest was approximately $251 million, which included primarily $154 million
of PP&E, $178 million of accounts receivable, $25 million of inventory, $54 million of deferred tax assets, $130 million of
accounts payable and other accruals, and $38 million of employee benefit obligations.
In December 2016, we completed the sale of certain mineral and non-mineral fee lands in northeastern Minnesota, which were
included in the Lower 48 segment, for $148 million and recorded a gain on disposition of $4 million. The majority of the assets
sold were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of ConocoPhillips holding a reversionary interest in the Greater
Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust (the Trust), a grantor trust that owned mineral and surface interests in the Mesabi Iron Range in
northeastern Minnesota and certain other personal property. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminated on
April 6, 2015. In November 2016, upon completion of the wind-down period, documents memorializing ConocoPhillips’
ownership of certain Trust property, including all of the Trust’s mineral properties and active leases, were delivered to us and we
recognized the fair value of the net assets resulting in a gain of $88 million recorded in the “Other income” line on our consolidated
income statement. At the time of the disposition, the carrying value of our interests, which included the assets obtained from the
Trust, consisted of $144 million of PP&E.

Our share of income taxes incurred directly by an equity company is reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is not
included in income taxes on our consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2018, retained earnings included $27 million related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies.
Dividends received from affiliates were $1,226 million, $605 million and $398 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
APLNG
APLNG is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, to supply the
domestic gas market and on LNG processing and export sales. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to coalbed methane
resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and
purchase agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG spot cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an
integrated Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG’s production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG
facility.
APLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility in 2012. The $8.5 billion project finance
facility was initially composed of financing agreements executed by APLNG with the Export-Import Bank of the United States for
approximately $2.9 billion, the Export-Import Bank of China for approximately $2.7 billion, and a syndicate of Australian and
international commercial banks for approximately $2.9 billion. At December 31, 2018, all amounts have been drawn from the
facility. APLNG made its first principal and interest repayment in March 2017 and is scheduled to make bi-annual payments until
March 2029.
APLNG made a voluntary repayment of $1.4 billion to the Export-Import Bank of China in September 2018. At the same time,
APLNG obtained a United States Private Placement (USPP) bond facility of $1.4 billion. Interest payments are scheduled to
commence in March 2019 and principal payments in September 2023, with bi-annual payments due on the facility until September
2030. At December 31, 2018, a balance of $7.2 billion was outstanding on the facilities.

Table of Contents
In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project
finance facility until the project achieves financial completion. In October 2016, we reached financial completion for Train 1,
which reduced our associated guarantee by 60 percent. In August 2017, we reached financial completion for both trains, which
removed the remaining guarantee.
APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of
subordinated financial support. See Note 3—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) for additional information.
On July 1, 2016, APLNG changed its tax functional currency from Australian dollar to U.S. dollar and translated all APLNG assets
and liabilities into U.S. dollar, utilizing the exchange rate as of that date. As a result of this change, we recorded a reduction to our
investment in APLNG for the deferred tax effect of $174 million in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line of our consolidated
income statement.
During the first half of 2017, the outlook for crude oil prices deteriorated, and as a result of significantly reduced price outlooks, the
estimated fair value of our investment in APLNG declined to an amount below carrying value. Based on a review of the facts and
circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the second quarter of 2017 the impairment was other than
temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures,” and the recognition of
an impairment of our investment to fair value was necessary. Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $2,384 million, before- and
after-tax impairment in our second-quarter 2017 results. Fair value was estimated based on an internal discounted cash flow model
using estimated future production, an outlook of future prices from a combination of exchanges (short-term) and pricing service
companies (long-term), costs, a market outlook of foreign exchange rates provided by a third party, and a discount rate believed to
be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The impairment was included in the “Impairments” line on our
consolidated income statement.
At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $7,522 million. The historical cost basis
of our 37.5 percent share of net assets on the books of APLNG was $7,231 million, resulting in a basis difference of $291 million
on our books. The basis difference, which is substantially all associated with PP&E and subject to amortization, has been allocated
on a relative fair value basis to individual exploration and production license areas owned by APLNG, some of which are not
currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each exploration license
area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of
basis difference amortization. As the joint venture produces natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference
allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2018,
2017 and 2016 was after-tax expense of $44 million, $100 million and $92 million, respectively, representing the amortization of
this basis difference on currently producing licenses.
Distributions from APLNG commenced in April 2018.
FCCL
FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream 50/50 general partnership with Cenovus Energy Inc., produces bitumen in the Athabasca
oil sands in northeastern Alberta and sells the bitumen blend. Cenovus is the operator and managing partner of FCCL.
On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of
our western Canada gas assets to Cenovus Energy. Financial information presented within this footnote includes our historical
interest up to the date of sale. For additional information on the Canada disposition and our investment in Cenovus Energy, see
Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions and Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy.

QG3
QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, with a
current outstanding balance of $461 million as described below under “Loans and Long-Term Receivables.” At December 31,
2018, the book value of our equity method investment in QG3, excluding the project financing, was $921 million. We have
terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas,
in which we have a 12.4 percent interest, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and
regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. However, currently the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the United
States. In January 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our ownership interests in Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden Pass
Pipeline. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions.
Loans and Long-Term Receivables
As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with
other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans and long-term receivables to certain affiliated and
non-affiliated companies. Loans are recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or
non-affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan
balance and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreement’s stated interest
rate. Loans and long-term receivables are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance may not be fully
recovered.
At December 31, 2018, significant loans to affiliated companies include $461 million in project financing to QG3. We own a
30 percent interest in QG3, for which we use the equity method of accounting. The other participants in the project are affiliates of
Qatar Petroleum and Mitsui. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans
from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips
loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved
financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. Semi-annual repayments began
in January 2011 and will extend through July 2022.
The long-term portion of these loans is included in the “Loans and advances—related parties” line on our consolidated balance
sheet, while the short-term portion is in “Accounts and notes receivable—related parties.”
Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy
On May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the majority of
our western Canada gas assets, to Cenovus Energy. Consideration for the transaction included 208 million Cenovus Energy
common shares, which approximated 16.9 percent of issued and outstanding Cenovus Energy common stock at closing. See Note 5
—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions for additional information on the Canada disposition. At
closing of the sale, the fair value and cost basis of our investment in 208 million Cenovus Energy common shares was $1.96 billion
based on a price of $9.41 per share on the New York Stock Exchange.
We adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01, beginning January 1, 2018, using the cumulative-effect approach. Results for
reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018, are presented under ASU No. 2016-01 with all changes in the fair value of our equity
securities reflected within the “Other income” line of our consolidated income statement and within the “Other” line in the “Cash
Flows From Operating Activities” section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Prior period amounts are not adjusted under
the cumulative-effect method of adopting ASU No. 2016-01. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 20—
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for the effect on our consolidated balance sheet and the line items that have been
impacted by the adoption of this standard.
 
103
Table of Contents
The cumulative effect of applying the standard was the reclassification of accumulated unrealized holding losses of $58 million,
recognized in 2017, related to our investment in Cenovus Energy from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.
Our investment is carried at fair value of $1.46 billion as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the closing price of Cenovus Energy
shares on the New York Stock Exchange of $7.03 per share, a decrease from its fair value of $1.90 billion at year-end 2017. For the
year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a before-tax unrealized loss of $437 million, related to the shares held at the reporting
date. See Note 15—Fair Value Measurement, for additional information. Subject to market conditions, we intend to decrease our
investment over time through market transactions, private agreements or otherwise.

In July 2016, we entered into an agreement to terminate our final Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract. The drillship, used
to drill our operated deepwater well inventory in the Gulf of Mexico through April 2016, was contracted on a shared, three-year
term. Accordingly, we recorded before-tax rig cancellation charges and third-party costs of $146 million in our Lower 48 segment
in 2016.
In February 2017, we reached a settlement agreement on our contract for the Athena drilling rig, initially secured for our four-well
commitment program in Angola. As a result of the cancellation, we recognized a before-tax charge of $43 million net in the first
quarter of 2017. These charges are included in the “Exploration expenses” line on our consolidated income statement and in our
Other International segment in 2017.

2018
In Alaska, we recorded impairments of $20 million primarily due to cancelled projects.
In the Lower 48, we recorded impairments of $63 million, primarily related to developed properties in our Barnett asset which were
written down to fair value less costs to sell, partly offset by a revision to reflect finalized proceeds on a separate transaction.
In our Europe and North Africa segment, we recorded a credit to impairment of $79 million, primarily due to decreased ARO
estimates on fields in the United Kingdom which have ceased production and were impaired in prior years, partly offset by an
increased ARO estimate on a field in Norway which has ceased production.
2017
In Alaska, we recorded impairments of $180 million primarily for the associated PP&E carrying value of our small interest in the
Point Thomson unit.
In the Lower 48, we recorded impairments of $3,969 million primarily due to certain developed properties which were written
down to fair value less costs to sell. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions, for
additional information on our dispositions.
In Canada, we recorded impairments of $22 million primarily due to cancelled projects.
In Europe and North Africa, we recorded impairments of $46 million primarily due to reduced volume forecasts for a field in the
United Kingdom and restructured ownership and a change in commercial premises for a gas processing plant in Norway, partly
offset by decreased ARO estimates on fields at or nearing the end of life which were impaired in prior years.
In Asia Pacific and Middle East, we recorded impairments of $2,384 million, including the impairment of our APLNG investment.
For more information, see the “APLNG” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables.
The charges discussed below, within this section, are included in the “Exploration expenses” line on our consolidated income
statement and are not reflected in the table above.
In our Lower 48 segment, we recorded a before-tax impairment of $51 million for the associated carrying value of capitalized
undeveloped leasehold costs of Shenandoah in deepwater Gulf of Mexico following the suspension of appraisal activity by the
operator. Additionally, we recorded a $38 million before-tax impairment for mineral assets primarily due to plan of development
changes.
2016
In the Lower 48, we recorded impairments of $149 million primarily due to cancelled projects associated with plan of development
changes for Eagle Ford infrastructure, as well as lower natural gas prices and increased ARO estimates.
In Canada, we recorded impairments of $88 million mainly due to plan of development changes, as well as certain developed
properties being written down to fair value less costs to sell.
In Europe and North Africa, we recorded a credit to impairment of $160 million, primarily in the United Kingdom, due to
decreased ARO estimates on fields at or nearing the end of life which were impaired in prior years, partly offset by asset
impairments due to lower natural gas prices in the United Kingdom.
In Asia Pacific and Middle East, we recorded impairments of $44 million, mainly due to a write-down to fair value less costs to sell
of our developed properties in Block B, offshore Indonesia, in the third quarter of 2016.
In Corporate and Other, we recorded impairments of $17 million due to cancelled projects in our Houston and Bartlesville offices.

Charges recorded in exploration expenses in 2016 were related to our decision announced in 2015 to reduce deepwater exploration
spending.
In our Lower 48 segment, we recorded a $203 million before-tax impairment for the associated carrying value of our Gibson and
Tiber undeveloped leaseholds in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we recorded a $95 million before-tax impairment for the
associated carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs of the Melmar prospect and a $79 million before-tax
impairment, primarily as a result of changes in the estimated market value following the completion of marketing efforts.
In our Canada segment, we recorded before-tax unproved property impairments of $31 million, primarily due to decisions to
discontinue additional testing of undeveloped leaseholds.
Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs
Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31 were:

Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs due within one year*    (398)   (347) 
  
Long-term asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs   $7,688   7,631 
  
*Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet under “Other accruals.”
Asset Retirement Obligations
We record the fair value of a liability for an ARO when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production
location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related PP&E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both
the liability and PP&E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates
over the useful life of the related asset.
We have numerous AROs we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most
of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general
company resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells and
removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in
Alaska.

Accrued Environmental Costs
Total accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2018 and 2017, were $178 million and $180 million, respectively.
We had accrued environmental costs of $100 million and $105 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to
remediation activities in the United States and Canada. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $67 million and $60 million of
environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition,
$11 million and $15 million were included at both December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, where the company has been named
a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or
similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.
Expected expenditures for environmental obligations acquired in various business combinations are discounted using a weighted-
average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $88 million at
December 31, 2018. The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have
been discounted are: $6 million in 2019, $6 million in 2020, $10 million in 2021, $6 million in 2022, $2 million in 2023, and
$109 million for all future years after 2023.

Maturities of long-term borrowings, inclusive of net unamortized premiums and discounts, in 2019 through 2023 are: $112 million,
$101 million, $213 million, $935 million and $195 million, respectively.
In May 2018, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.75 billion to $6.0 billion
with a new expiration date of May 2023. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of
letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly
syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring
maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the
failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated
subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank
market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States.
The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights
if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
The revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips Company $6.0 billion commercial paper program, which is primarily a
funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We had no
commercial paper outstanding in programs in place at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. We had no direct outstanding
borrowings or letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. Since we had no
commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.0 billion in borrowing capacity under our
revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018.
In 2018, we repaid the $250 million floating rate note due in 2018 at its natural maturity.    
We also redeemed or repurchased a total $4,450 million of debt in 2018, described below, incurring $208 million in net premiums
above book value, which are reported in the “Other expenses” line on our consolidated income statement.

At both December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with
maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. The VRDBs are
included in the “Long-term debt” line on our consolidated balance sheet.
During 2013, a lease of a semi-submersible floating production system (FPS) commenced for the Gumusut development, located in
Malaysia, in which we are a co-venturer. The FPS lease provides for an initial noncancelable term of 15 years, a subsequent 5-year
cancelable term with no required lease payments, and an
 
110
Table of Contents
additional 5-year term with terms and conditions to be agreed at a later date. The lease has no ongoing purchase options or
escalation clauses. Adjustments to provisional contingent rental payments may occur due to the finalization of actual
commissioning costs. The lease does not impose any significant restrictions concerning dividends, debt or further leasing activities.
A capital lease asset and capital lease obligation were recognized for our proportionate interest in the FPS of $906 million, based on
the present value of the future minimum lease payments using our before-tax incremental borrowing rate of 3.58 percent for debt
with similar terms. Our proportionate interest in the FPS is 29 percent as of December 31, 2018. The net carrying value of the
capital lease asset was approximately $353 million and $434 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The capital
lease asset is being depreciated over a period consistent with the estimated proved reserves of Gumusut using the
unit-of-production method with the associated depreciation included in the “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” line on our
consolidated income statement. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, accumulated depreciation of the capital lease asset amounted
to approximately $462 million and $381 million, respectively.

Note 12—Guarantees
At December 31, 2018, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described
below. We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified
guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of
the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the
guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
APLNG Guarantees
At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 37.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG.
The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2018 exchange rates:
 
 • During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in
a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee is 12 years. Our maximum exposure
under this guarantee is approximately $170 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by
the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately
$14 million.
 
111
Table of Contents
 • In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy in October 2008, we
agreed to reimburse Origin Energy for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an
existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements with remaining terms of up to 23
years. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is
estimated to be $800 million ($1.4 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if
APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future
payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does
not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity
contributions into APLNG.
 
 • We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the
project’s continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of up to 27 years or the life of the venture. Our
maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $140 million and would
become payable if APLNG does not perform.
Other Guarantees
We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately $780 million, which consist
primarily of guarantees of the residual value of leased office buildings, guarantees of the residual value of leased corporate aircraft,
and a guarantee for our portion of a joint venture’s project finance reserve accounts. These guarantees have remaining terms of up
to four years and would become payable if, upon sale, certain asset values are lower than guaranteed amounts, business conditions
decline at guaranteed entities, or as a result of nonperformance of contractual terms by guaranteed parties.
Indemnifications
Over the years, we have entered into agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that
gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. These agreements include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, employee
claims and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related to
environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The
carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at December 31, 2018, was approximately $90 million. We amortize the
indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of
indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability
is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification exposure
declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the
indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in
the recorded carrying amount at December 31, 2018, were approximately $30 million of environmental accruals for known
contamination that are included in the “Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs” line on our consolidated
balance sheet. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments.
In 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips
and Phillips 66. On March 1, 2015, a supplier to one of the refineries included in Phillips 66 as part of the separation of our
downstream businesses formally registered Phillips 66 as a party to the supply agreement, thereby triggering a guarantee we
provided at the time of separation. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of this guarantee was $98 million. Because Phillips
66 has indemnified us for losses incurred under this guarantee, we also recorded an indemnification asset from Phillips 66 of
$98 million. During the third quarter of 2018, a termination agreement between the supplier and Phillips 66 was executed, releasing
all parties from their respective obligations under the supply agreement. Since all obligations under the supply agreement were
satisfied and discharged, the guarantee was terminated. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of this guarantee and the
associated indemnification asset have been removed.
 
112
Table of Contents
Note 13—Contingencies and Commitments
A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against
ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal
or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need
for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to
income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be
reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is
accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for
probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative
probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. See Note 19—Income Taxes, for
additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures
will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As
we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential
exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation,
tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain
magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of
our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to
change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
Environmental
We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated
financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management’s best estimates, using all information
that is available at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and
presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring
environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup
experience, and data released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider unasserted
claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably
estimable.
Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal
sites and frequently so for other sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and
several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially
responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the
sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the agency concerned. Prior to actual
cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate
remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other
potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating
our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain
environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our
benefit, and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state and
international sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an
undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned
investigation and remediation activities for
 
113
Table of Contents
sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these
accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and
proceedings. See Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued
environmental liabilities.
Legal Proceedings
We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax
payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, personal injury, and property
damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and
privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations. We will continue to defend
ourselves vigorously in these matters.
Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases,
employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the
early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that
have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation
management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses
the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
Other Contingencies
We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with
financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through
advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we had performance
obligations secured by letters of credit of $323 million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase
commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
In 2007, ConocoPhillips was unable to reach agreement with respect to the empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan
government’s Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela’s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), or its
affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore
Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, ConocoPhillips initiated international arbitration on November 2,
2007, with the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). On September 3, 2013, an ICSID
arbitration tribunal held that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips’ significant oil investments in June 2007. On
January 17, 2017, the Tribunal reconfirmed the decision that the expropriation was unlawful. A separate arbitration phase is
currently proceeding to determine the damages owed to ConocoPhillips for Venezuela’s actions.
In 2014, ConocoPhillips filed a separate and independent arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC) against PDVSA under the contracts that had established the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects. The ICC Tribunal issued an
award in April 2018, finding that PDVSA owed ConocoPhillips approximately $2 billion under their agreements in connection with
the expropriation of the projects and other pre-expropriation fiscal measures. In August 2018, ConocoPhillips entered into a
settlement with PDVSA to recover the full amount of this ICC award, plus interest through the payment period, including initial
payments totaling approximately $500 million within a period of 90 days from the time of signing of the settlement agreement. The
balance of the settlement is to be paid quarterly over a period of four and a half years. By year-end 2018, we collected from
PDVSA under the settlement and recognized in other income $430 million before-tax consisting of $230 million from the sale of
commodity inventory and $200 million in cash. The remainder of the initial payments will become an adjustment to a future
quarterly installment. Per the settlement, PDVSA recognized the ICC award as a judgment in various jurisdictions, and
ConocoPhillips agreed to suspend its legal enforcement actions, including in the Dutch Caribbean. ConocoPhillips has ensured that
the settlement meets all appropriate U.S. regulatory requirements, including any applicable sanctions imposed by the U.S. against
Venezuela.

In 2016, ConocoPhillips filed a separate and independent arbitration under the rules of the ICC against PDVSA under the contracts
that had established the Corocoro project. This ICC arbitration is currently in progress.
In February 2017, the ICSID tribunal unanimously awarded Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
ConocoPhillips, $380 million for Ecuador’s unlawful expropriation of Burlington’s investment in Blocks 7 and 21, in breach of the
U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. The tribunal also issued a separate decision finding Ecuador to be entitled to $42 million
for environmental and infrastructure counterclaims. In December 2017, Burlington and Ecuador entered into a settlement
agreement by which Ecuador paid Burlington $337 million in two installments. The first installment of $75 million was paid in
December 2017, and the second installment of $262 million was paid in April 2018. The settlement included an offset for the
counterclaims decision, of which Burlington is entitled to a $24 million contribution from Perenco Ecuador Limited, its co-venturer
and consortium operator, pursuant to a joint and several liability provision in the joint operating agreement (JOA). Ecuador’s
environmental and infrastructure counterclaims against Perenco remain pending in a separate ICSID arbitration between Perenco
and Ecuador, and Burlington may owe Perenco contribution under the JOA for damages found by this tribunal.
In December 2016, ConocoPhillips Angola filed a notice of arbitration against Sonangol E.P. under the Block 36 Production
Sharing Contract relating to disputes arising thereunder. In 2018, the parties reached a confidential settlement.
In June 2017, FAR Ltd. initiated arbitration before the ICC against ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V. in connection with the sale of
ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V. to Woodside Energy Holdings (Senegal) Limited in 2016. This arbitration is ongoing.
In late 2017, ConocoPhillips (U.K.) Limited (CPUKL) initiated United Nations Commission on International Trade and Law
(UNCITRAL) arbitration against Vietnam in accordance with the U.K.-Vietnam Bilateral Investment Treaty relating to a tax
dispute arising from the 2012 sale of ConocoPhillips (U.K.) Cuu Long Limited and ConocoPhillips (U.K.) Gama Limited. The
tribunal was constituted in February 2018. The arbitration is ongoing.
In 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, a state government, and a trade association in California, New York, Washington, Rhode Island
and Maryland, as well as the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Association, Inc., have filed lawsuits against oil and gas
companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.
ConocoPhillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuits. The lawsuits brought by the Cities of San Francisco, Oakland and
New York have been dismissed by the district courts and appeals are pending.
Several Louisiana parishes and individual landowners have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips,
seeking compensatory damages in connection with historical oil and gas operations in Louisiana. ConocoPhillips will vigorously
defend against these lawsuits.
Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements
We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically
provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate
amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements are: 2019—$7 million; 2020—$7 million; 2021—$7 million; 2022
—$7 million; 2023—$7 million; and 2024 and after—$61 million. Total payments under the agreements were $39 million in 2018,
$43 million in 2017 and $42 million in 2016.

Note 14—Derivative and Financial Instruments
We use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to meet our customer needs and capture market opportunities. Our
commodity business primarily consists of natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, LNG and natural gas liquids.
Our derivative instruments are held at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Where these balances have the right of setoff,
they are presented on a net basis. Related cash flows are recorded as operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash
flows. On our consolidated income statement, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized either on a gross basis if
directly related to our physical business or a net basis if held for trading. Gains and losses related to contracts that meet and are
designated with the normal purchase normal sale exception are recognized upon settlement. We generally apply this exception to
eligible crude contracts. We do not use hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives.

Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives
We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. Our foreign currency exchange derivative
activity primarily relates to managing our cash-related foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for
capital programs or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates, and
investments in equity securities. We do not elect hedge accounting on our foreign currency exchange derivatives.

Financial Instruments
We invest excess cash in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various currency pools we
manage. The maturities of these investments may from time to time extend beyond 90 days. The types of financial instruments that
we currently invest include:
 
 • Time deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with approved financial institutions.
 • Commercial paper: Unsecured promissory notes issued by a corporation, commercial bank or government agency
purchased at a discount to mature at par.
 • Government or government agency obligations: Short-term securities issued by the U.S. government or U.S. government
agencies.

Credit Risk
Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term
investments, over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments
are placed in high-quality commercial paper, government money market funds, government debt securities and time deposits with
major international banks and financial institutions.
The credit risk from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards, swaps and options, derives from the counterparty to the
transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call
margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts
that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin
requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily
margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base,
which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less,
and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require collateral to
limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments and master netting arrangements to
mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or
owed to others to be offset against amounts due to us.
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a
threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are
contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable
and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all
contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
 
118
Table of Contents
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability
position on December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was $62 million and $55 million, respectively. For these instruments, no
collateral was posted as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. If our credit rating had been downgraded below investment
grade on December 31, 2018, we would be required to post $62 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.
Note 15—Fair Value Measurement
We carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at a reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under
the following hierarchy:
 
 • Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
 • Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.
The classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially
classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential
to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities initially reported as Level 2 are
subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available. Transfers occur at the end of the reporting
period. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, our $1,899 million investment in Cenovus Energy was transferred from Level 2 to
Level 1 due to the lapsing of trading restrictions. There were no other material transfers in or out of Level 1 during 2018 or 2017.
Recurring Fair Value Measurement
Financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include our investment in Cenovus Energy shares
and commodity derivatives. Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are
valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange. Level 1 also includes our investment in common shares of
Cenovus Energy, which is valued using quotes for shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities
primarily represent OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices,
prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data. Level 3 derivative assets and
liabilities consist of OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts where a significant portion of fair value is
calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available. The derived value uses industry standard methodologies that
may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and
other relevant economic measures. The use of these inputs results in management’s best estimate of fair value. Level 3 activity was
not material for all periods presented.

Net PP&E (held for sale)
Net PP&E held for sale was written down to fair value, less costs to sell. The fair value of each asset was determined by its
negotiated selling price (Level 1) or information gathered during marketing efforts (Level 3). For additional information see Note 5
—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions.
Net PP&E (held for use)
Net PP&E held for use is comprised of various producing properties impaired to their individual fair values. The fair values were
determined by internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices from futures exchanges and
pricing service companies, costs, and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.
Equity Method Investments
During 2017, our investment in APLNG was written down to its fair value of $7,656 million, resulting in a before-tax-charge of
$2,384 million. For additional information on APLNG, see Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables.
Reported Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:
 
 • Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates
fair value.
 • Accounts and notes receivable (including long-term and related parties): The carrying amount reported on the balance
sheet approximates fair value. The valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of the current portion
of fixed-rate related party loans is consistent with Loans and advances—related parties.
 • Investment in Cenovus Energy shares: See Note 7—Investment in Cenovus Energy for a discussion of the carrying value
and fair value of our investment in Cenovus Energy shares.

Table of Contents
 • Loans and advances—related parties: The carrying amount of floating-rate loans approximates fair value. The fair value
of fixed-rate loan activity is measured using market observable data and is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy. See Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information.
 • Accounts payable (including related parties) and floating-rate debt: The carrying amount of accounts payable and
floating-rate debt reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
 • Fixed-rate debt: The estimated fair value of fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that
is corroborated by market data; therefore, these liabilities are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 17—Non-Mineral Leases
The company primarily leases drilling equipment and office buildings, as well as ocean transport vessels, tugboats, barges,
corporate aircraft and other facilities and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to
reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased property for the fair market value
at the end of the lease term. There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the leasing agreements with regard to dividends,
asset dispositions or borrowing ability. For additional information on leased assets under capital leases, see Note 11—Debt.

In 2018, we purchased a group annuity contract from Prudential and transferred $730 million of future benefit obligations from the
U.S. qualified pension plan to Prudential. The purchase of the group annuity contract was funded directly by plan assets of the U.S.
qualified pension plan. Effective January 1, 2019, the Cash Balance Account (Title II) of the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan, a
U.S. qualified pension plan, was closed to new entrants. New employees and rehires on or after January 1, 2019, and employees
that elected to opt out of Title II will no longer receive pay credits to their Cash Balance Account and instead will be eligible for a
Company Retirement Contribution (CRC) as described in the Defined Contribution Plans section.
We recognized pension settlement losses of $196 million in 2018, $131 million in 2017, and $202 million in 2016 as lump-sum
benefit payments from certain U.S. pension plans exceeded the sum of service and interest costs for those plans and led to
recognition of settlement losses.
As part of the 2016 restructuring program, we concluded that actions taken during the year resulted in a significant reduction of
future services of active employees primarily in the U.S. qualified pension plan and a U.S. nonqualified supplemental retirement
plan. As a result, we recognized an increase in the benefit obligation and a proportionate share of prior service cost from other
comprehensive income (loss) as a curtailment loss of $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Also, as part of the 2016 restructuring program in the United States and Europe, we recognized expense for special termination
benefits of $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting of $14 million in the United States and $1 million in
Europe.
In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the
average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we
amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.

We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and
subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are
noncontributory. The measurement of the U.S. pre-65 retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a
health care cost trend rate of 7 percent in 2019 that declines to 5 percent by 2024. The measurement of the U.S. post-65 retiree
medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent achieved in
2019. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would be immaterial to ConocoPhillips.
Plan Assets—We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes and individual holdings. As a
result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S.
equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries
may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are
39 percent equity securities, 54 percent debt securities, 6 percent real estate and 1 percent other. Generally, the plan investments are
publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There have been no changes in the
methodologies used at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
 • Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 1 are primarily based on quoted
market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
 • Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities
categorized in Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets and for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no
market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the
security against other securities with actual market prices. When observable quoted market prices are not available, fair
value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as
benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
 • Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value
of the underlying assets.
 • Fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
 • Time deposits are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
 • Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in Level 2
are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates. U.S. cash balances held in the form of short-term
fund units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as Level 2.
 • Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives
classified in Level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-
party sources.
 • Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance
company to the plans’ participants.
 • Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include
reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.
 • A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is
calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by
the contract. The participating interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined
via a combination of quoted market prices, recently executed transactions, and an actuarial present value computation for
contract obligations. At December 31, 2018, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $84 million
and consisted of $228 million in debt securities, less $144 million for the accumulated
 
128
Table of Contents
 benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December 31, 2017, the participating interest in the annuity contract was
valued at $99 million and consisted of $265 million in debt securities, less $166 million for the accumulated benefit
obligation covered by the contract. The net change from 2017 to 2018 is due to a decrease in the fair value of the
underlying investments of $37 million offset by a decrease in the present value of the contract obligation of $22 million.
The participating interest is not available for meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near term. No future
company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

Level 3 activity was not material for all periods.
Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax
regulations. In 2019, we expect to contribute approximately $195 million to our domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and
postretirement benefit plans and $185 million to our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit
plans.

Defined Contribution Plans
Most U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP). Employees can deposit up to
75 percent of their eligible pay, subject to statutory limits, in the CPSP to a choice of approximately 34 investment options.
Employees who participate in the CPSP and contribute 1 percent of their eligible pay receive a 6 percent company cash match with
a potential company discretionary cash contribution of up to 6 percent. Effective January 1, 2019, new employees, rehires, and
employees that elected to opt out of Title II will be eligible to receive a CRC of 6 percent of eligible pay into their CPSP. After
three years of service with the company, the employee is 100 percent vested in any CRC. Company contributions charged to
expense for the CPSP and predecessor plans were $82 million in 2018, $77 million in 2017, and $58 million in 2016.
We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and eligibility depending on
location. Total compensation expense recognized for these international plans was approximately $31 million in 2018, $35 million
in 2017, and $44 million in 2016.
Share-Based Compensation Plans
The 2014 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May
2014. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 79 million shares of our common stock for compensation to our
employees and directors; however, as of the effective date of the Plan, (i) any shares of common stock available for future awards
under the prior plans and (ii) any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the prior plans that are forfeited,
expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock
back to the

Table of Contents
company shall be available for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Of the 79 million
shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40 million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock
options. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is authorized to determine the types,
terms, conditions and limitations of awards granted. Awards may be granted in the form of, but not limited to, stock options,
restricted stock units and performance share units to employees and non-employee directors who contribute to the company’s
continued success and profitability.
Total share-based compensation expense is measured using the grant date fair value for our equity-classified awards and the
settlement date fair value for our liability-classified awards. We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of
the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service
period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum
period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture. Our share-based compensation programs generally provide
accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the
time of their retirement. Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some
of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). We recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service
period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
Compensation Expense—Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income (loss) and the associated tax benefit for
the years ended December 31 were as follows:
 
               Millions of Dollars             
     
   2018   2017   2016 
     
Compensation cost     $ 265    227    272 
Tax benefit    64    76    92 
  
Stock Options—Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and prior plans permit purchase of our common stock at
exercise prices equivalent to the average fair market value of ConocoPhillips common stock on the date the options were granted.
The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming
exercisable on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to certain employees already eligible for
retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting
period. Beginning in 2018, stock option grants were discontinued and replaced with three-year, time-vested restricted stock units
which generally will be cash-settled.
The fair market values of the options granted in 2017 and 2016 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used were as follows:
 
     2017     2016 
       
Assumptions used         
Risk-free interest rate      2.24 %      1.55 
Dividend yield      4.00 %      4.00 
Volatility factor      28.12 %      26.80 
Expected life (years)      6.39       6.37 
  
There were no ranges in the assumptions used to determine the fair market values of our options granted in 2017 and 2016.
 
 
132
Table of Contents
We believe our historical volatility for periods prior to the 2012 separation of our Downstream businesses is no longer relevant in
estimating expected volatility. For 2017 and 2016, expected volatility was based on the weighted-average blend of the company’s
historical stock price volatility from May 1, 2012 (the date of separation of our Downstream businesses) through the stock option
grant date and the average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies for the expected term of the options.
The following summarizes our stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2018:

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of outstanding options, vested options and exercisable options at December 31,
2018, was 5.16 years, 5.09 years and 4.69 years, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock option awards
granted during 2017 and 2016 was $9.18 and $5.39, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $4 million
in 2017 and zero in 2016.
During 2018, we received $178 million in cash and realized a tax benefit of $18 million from the exercise of options. At
December 31, 2018, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $2 million, which will be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.87 years, the longest period being 1.12 years.
Stock Unit Program—Generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the Plan and vest in an
aggregate installment on the third anniversary of the grant date. In addition, restricted stock units granted under the Plan for a
variable long-term incentive program vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant
date. Restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which
these restricted stock units vest vary by award.
Stock-Settled
Upon vesting, these restricted stock units are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded
to retirement eligible employees vest six months from the grant date; however, those units are not issued as common stock until the
earlier of separation from the company or the end of the regularly scheduled vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients
of the restricted stock units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. The grant
date fair market value of these restricted stock units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date.
The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average
ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.

At December 31, 2018, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested stock-settled units was $88 million,
which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.68 years, the longest period being 2.76 years. The weighted-average
grant date fair value of stock unit awards granted during 2017 and 2016 was $48.77 and $32.15, respectively. The total fair value of
stock units issued during 2017 and 2016 was $159 million and $191 million, respectively.
Cash-Settled
Beginning in 2018, cash-settled executive restricted stock units replaced the stock option program. These restricted stock units,
subject to elections to defer, will be settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per
unit on the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Units awarded to retirement eligible employees vest
six months from the grant date; however, those units are not settled until the earlier of separation from the company or the end of
the regularly scheduled vesting period. Compensation expense is initially measured using the average fair market value of
ConocoPhillips common stock and is subsequently adjusted, based on changes in the ConocoPhillips stock price through the end of
each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement date. Recipients receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is
charged to compensation expense. The accrued reinvested dividend is paid at the time of settlement, subject to the terms and
conditions of the award.

Performance Share Program—Under the Plan, we also annually grant restricted performance share units (PSUs) to senior
management. These PSUs are authorized three years prior to their effective grant date (the performance period). Compensation
expense is initially measured using the average fair market value of ConocoPhillips common stock and is subsequently adjusted,
based on changes in the ConocoPhillips stock price through the end of each subsequent reporting period, through the grant date for
stock-settled awards and the settlement date for cash-settled awards.
Stock-Settled
For performance periods beginning before 2009, PSUs do not vest until the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching
age 55 with five years of service, and restrictions do not lapse until the employee separates from the company. With respect to
awards for performance periods beginning in 2009 through 2012, PSUs do not vest until the earlier of the date the employee
becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or five years after the grant date of the award, and
restrictions do not lapse until the earlier of the employee’s separation from the company or five years after the grant date (although
recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation). We recognize compensation expense for these awards
beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are authorized three years
prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense
over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. Until issued as stock, recipients of the PSUs
receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized
for future grants will vest, absent employee election to defer, upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year
performance period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the
conclusion of the performance period. PSUs are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit.

At December 31, 2018, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested stock-settled performance share awards was
zero. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-settled PSUs granted during 2017 and 2016 was $49.76 and $33.13,
respectively. The total fair value of stock-settled PSUs issued during 2017 and 2016 was $57 million and $17 million, respectively.
Cash-Settled
In connection with and immediately following the separation of our Downstream businesses in 2012, grants of new PSUs, subject
to a shortened performance period, were authorized. Once granted, these PSUs vest, absent employee election to defer, on the
earlier of five years after the grant date of the award or the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement. For employees
eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date
of authorization and ending on the date of grant. Otherwise, we recognize compensation expense beginning on the grant date and
ending on
 
135
Table of Contents
the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. These PSUs are settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips
common stock per unit on the settlement date and thus are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Until settlement occurs,
recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense.
Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants will vest upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year
performance period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending at the
conclusion of the performance period. These PSUs will be settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of
ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. For performance
periods beginning before 2018, during the performance period, recipients of the PSUs do not receive a quarterly cash payment of a
dividend equivalent, but after the performance period ends, until settlement in cash occurs, recipients of the PSUs receive a
quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense. For the performance period beginning in
2018, recipients of the PSUs receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense. The
accrued reinvested dividend is paid at the time of settlement, subject to the terms and conditions of the award.
The following summarizes our cash-settled Performance Share Program activity for the year ended December 31, 2018:

At December 31, 2018, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested cash-settled performance share awards was
$1 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.89 years, the longest period being 1.13 years. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of cash-settled PSUs granted during 2017 and 2016 was $49.76 and $33.13, respectively.
The total fair value of cash-settled performance share awards settled during 2017 and 2016 was $24 million and $31 million,
respectively.
From inception of the Performance Share Program through 2013, approved PSU awards were granted after the conclusion of
performance periods. Beginning in February 2014, initial target PSU awards are issued near the beginning of new performance
periods. These initial target PSU awards will terminate at the end of the performance periods and will be settled after the
performance periods have ended. Also in 2014, initial target PSU awards were issued for open performance periods that began in
prior years. For the open performance period beginning in 2012, the initial target PSU awards terminated at the end of the three-
year performance period and were replaced with approved PSU awards. For the open performance period beginning in 2013, the
initial target PSU awards terminated at the end of the three-year performance period and were settled after the performance period
ended. There is no effect on recognition of compensation expense.
Other—In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were
either issued as part of our non-employee director compensation program for current and former members of the company’s Board
of Directors or as part of an executive compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the recipients of the restricted
shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.

Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized.
During 2018, valuation allowances increased a total of $1,786 million. The increase primarily relates to deferred tax assets
recognized during 2018 as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation), as further discussed below, and are related
to U.S. tax basis and foreign tax credits associated with our foreign branch assets that we do not expect to realize. Based on our
historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects deferred tax
assets, net of valuation allowance, will primarily be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities.

At December 31, 2018, unremitted income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign
corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $3,808 million. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this amount, as we
do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. The estimated amount of additional tax, primarily
local withholding tax, that would be payable on this income if distributed is approximately $190 million.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1,081 million, $882 million and $359 million,
respectively, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. The balance of the unrecognized tax benefits increased in
2018 mainly due to the treatment of distributions from certain of foreign subsidiaries. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits
increased in 2017 mainly due to the recognition of a U.S. worthless securities deduction that we do not believe will generate a cash
tax benefit.
At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $45 million, $54 million and
$54 million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in a benefit to earnings of $4 million in 2018,
no impact to earnings in 2017, and a benefit to earnings of $18 million in 2016.
We file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are
generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2015), Canada (2010), United States (2014) and Norway (2017). Issues in dispute
for audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in
which we operate around the world. Consequently, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from
period to period. It is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax
benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2018 was primarily due to the impact of the Clair Field disposition in the U.K. and our
overall income position, partially offset by our mix of income among taxing jurisdictions.
Our effective tax rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary to BP. The subsidiary held a
16.5 percent interest in the BP-operated Clair Field in the United Kingdom. The disposition generated a before-tax gain of
$715 million with no associated tax cost. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions for
additional information on the U.K. disposition.
Tax Legislation was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to
21 percent from 35 percent, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that
were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
SAB 118 measurement period
We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of Tax Legislation in
2017 and throughout 2018. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for all the enactment-date income tax
effects of Tax Legislation under ASC 740, Income Taxes, for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the
one-time transition tax. As of December 31, 2018, we have now completed our accounting for all the enactment-date income tax
effects of Tax Legislation. As further discussed below, during 2018, we recognized adjustments of $10 million to the provisional
amounts recorded at December 31, 2017, and included these adjustments as a component of income tax provision.
Provisional Amounts—Foreign tax effects
The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings, the tax on which we previously deferred from U.S. income
taxes under U.S. law. We estimated at December 31, 2017, that we would not incur a one-time transition tax. Upon further analyses
of Tax Legislation and Notices and regulations issued and proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal
Revenue Service, we finalized our calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018. Based upon this analysis, we did not incur
a one-time transition tax.
 
140
Table of Contents
As a result of the Tax Legislation, we removed the indefinite reinvestment assertion on one of our foreign subsidiaries and recorded
a tax expense of $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities
As of December 31, 2017, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected
to reverse in the future (which was generally 21 percent), by recording a provisional amount of $908 million. Upon further analysis
of certain aspects of Tax Legislation and refinement of our calculations during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, we
adjusted our provisional amount by $10 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense.    
Global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI)
We have elected to account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. At December 31, 2018, the current-year U.S. income tax
impact related to GILTI activities is immaterial.
Our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $1,277 million related to the Canada disposition. This tax
benefit was primarily associated with a deferred tax recovery related to the Canadian capital gains exclusion component of the 2017
Canada disposition and the recognition of previously unrealizable Canadian capital asset tax basis. The Canada disposition, along
with the associated restructuring of our Canadian operations, may generate an additional tax benefit of $822 million. However,
since we believe it is not likely we will receive a corresponding cash tax savings, this $822 million benefit has been offset by a full
tax reserve. See Note 5—Assets Held for Sale, Sold or Acquired and Other Planned Dispositions for additional information on our
Canada disposition.
The impairment of our APLNG investment in the second quarter of 2017 did not generate a tax benefit. See the “APLNG” section
of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for information on the impairment of our APLNG investment.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2016 was primarily due to our mix of income among taxing jurisdictions, reduced net tax
benefit from the tax law changes discussed below, and the absence of a tax benefit associated with electing the fair market value
method of apportioning interest expense for prior years.
In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on September 15, 2016, to decrease the overall U.K. upstream corporation tax rate
from 50 percent to 40 percent effective January 1, 2016. As a result, we recorded a $161 million net tax benefit related to the
remeasurement of our U.K. deferred tax balance in 2016.
Certain operating losses in jurisdictions outside of the United States only yield a tax benefit in the United States as a worthless
security deduction. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, before consideration of unrecorded tax benefits discussed above, the amount of the
tax benefit was $36 million, $962 million and $60 million, respectively.

Note 24—Sales and Other Operating Revenues
Transitional Arrangements
We adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 606 beginning January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach, which we have
applied to contracts within the scope of the standard that had not been completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting
periods beginning after January 1, 2018, are presented under ASC Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and
continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles for the effect on our
consolidated balance sheet and the line items which have been impacted by the adoption of this standard.
The cumulative effect of applying the standard relates solely to certain licensing arrangements where revenue was previously
recognized ($61 million in 2011, $146 million in 2015, and $44 million in 2017) based on contractual milestones. Under ASC
Topic 606, such revenues are recognized when the customer has the ability to utilize and benefit from its right to use the license. As
a result, such historically recognized revenues must be reversed through a cumulative effect adjustment and deferred until such
time when the customer has the ability to utilize and benefit from the license. The cumulative effect adjustment relates to contracts
that were not substantially completed at the date of implementation.
Practical Expedients
Typically, our commodity sales contracts are less than 12 months in duration; however, certain commodity sales contracts may
carry a longer duration, which may extend to the end of field life. We have long-term commodity sales contracts which use
prevailing market prices at the time of delivery, and under these contracts, the market-based variable consideration for each
performance obligation (i.e., delivery of commodity) is allocated to each wholly unsatisfied performance obligation within the
contract. Accordingly, we have applied the practical expedient allowed in ASC Topic 606 and do not disclose the aggregate amount
of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations or when we expect to recognize revenues that are unsatisfied (or
partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period.

Revenues from contracts outside the scope of ASC Topic 606 relate primarily to physical gas contracts at market prices which
qualify as derivatives accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and for which we have not elected normal
purchases and normal sales (NPNS). There is no significant difference in contractual terms or the policy for recognition of revenue
from these contracts and those within the scope of ASC Topic 606. The following disaggregation of revenues is provided in

Receivables and Contract Liabilities
Receivables from Contracts with Customers
At December 31, 2018, the “Accounts and notes receivable” line on our consolidated balance sheet included trade receivables of
$2,889 million compared with $2,675 million at December 31, 2017, and included both contracts with customers within the scope
of ASC Topic 606 and those that are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606. We typically receive payment within 30 days or less
(depending on the terms of the invoice) once delivery is made. Revenues that are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606 relate
primarily to physical gas sales contracts at market prices for which we do not elect NPNS and are therefore accounted for as a
derivative
under ASC Topic 815. There is little distinction in the nature of the customer or credit quality of trade receivables associated with
gas sold under contracts for which NPNS has not been elected compared with trade receivables where NPNS has been elected.

Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
We have entered into contractual arrangements where we license proprietary technology to customers related to the optimization
process for operating LNG plants. The agreements typically provide for negotiated payments to be made at stated milestones. The
payments are not directly related to our performance under the contract and are recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized as
revenue when the customer can utilize and benefit from their right to use the license. Payments are received in installments over the
construction period.

During 2018, we recognized revenue of $148 million in the “Sales and other operating revenues” line on our consolidated income
statement. We expect to recognize the contract liabilities as of December 31, 2018, as revenue between the remainder of 2019 and
2022 as construction is completed.
Prior to the adoption of ASC Topic 606, contractual cash payments received were recognized as “Sales and other operating
revenues” when received.
Note 25—Segment Disclosures and Related Information
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.
We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48,
Canada, Europe and North Africa, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums on
early retirement of debt, corporate overhead and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues. Corporate assets
include all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. Segment accounting
policies are the same as those in Note 1—Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.

Note 26—New Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (ASU No. 2016-02), which establishes comprehensive accounting
and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements. This ASU supersedes the existing requirements in FASB ASC Topic
840, “Leases” (FASB ASC Topic 840), and requires lessees to recognize substantially all lease assets and lease liabilities on the
balance sheet. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 also modify the definition of a lease and outline requirements for recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors. The ASU is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption of the standard is permitted. Entities are required to adopt
the ASU using a modified retrospective approach, subject to certain optional practical expedients, and apply the provisions of ASU
No. 2016-02 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements.
ASU No. 2016-02 was amended in January 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for
Transition to Topic 842” (ASU No. 2018-01), and in July 2018 by the provisions of ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification
Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” (ASU No. 2018-10). In addition, ASU No. 2016-02 was further amended in July 2018 by the
provisions of ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (ASU No. 2018-11), and in December 2018 by the provisions of ASU
No. 2018-20, “Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors” (ASU No. 2018-20).
ASU No. 2018-11 sets forth certain additional practical expedients for lessors and provides entities with an option to apply the
provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the ASU’s effective date of
adoption (the “Optional Transition Method”). Entities that elect to utilize the Optional Transition Method would not apply the
provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, to comparative periods presented in the financial statements.
We plan to adopt ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019, utilizing the Optional Transition Method. Accordingly,
the comparative periods presented in the financial statements prior to January 1, 2019, will be presented pursuant to the existing
requirements of FASB ASC Topic 840 and not be adjusted upon the adoption of the ASU. We also expect to utilize the package of
optional transition-related practical expedients set forth by ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, which permit entities to not reassess
upon the adoption of the ASU

certain historical conclusions regarding lease contract identification and classification, as well as the historical accounting treatment
of initial direct costs (the “Package of Optional Practical Expedients”). For lease arrangements containing both lease and non-lease
components, we will adopt the optional practical expedient to not separate lease components from non-lease components for all
new or modified leases executed on or after the effective date of the ASU, subject to making any elections for leases after the
effective date in new asset classes. Furthermore, we do not expect to record assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet
for new or existing lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less.    
The expected impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, relates primarily to our balance sheet, resulting from the
initial recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for our existing population of operating leases, as well as
enhanced disclosure of our leasing arrangements. We expect to recognize on our consolidated balance sheet approximately
$1 billion of operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended.
We have implemented a third-party lease accounting software solution to facilitate the ongoing accounting and financial reporting
requirements of the ASU and also expect the adoption of the ASU to result in certain changes being made to our existing
accounting policies and systems, business processes, and internal controls.    
While our evaluation of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, and related implementation activities approach completion, we continue to
monitor proposals issued by the FASB to clarify the ASU.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (ASU No. 2016-13),
which sets forth the current expected credit loss model, a new forward-looking impairment model for certain financial instruments
based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2019, and early adoption of the standard is permitted. Entities are required to adopt ASU No. 2016-13 using a
modified retrospective approach, subject to certain limited exceptions. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
this ASU.

Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited)    
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, “Extractive
Activities—Oil and Gas,” and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain
supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.
These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity
affiliates’ oil and gas activities in our operating segments. As a result, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas
Operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.
As required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for
economic reasons is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when
production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the
estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under the
“economic interest” method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable
operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely
to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At
December 31, 2018, approximately 6 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, located in our Asia Pacific/Middle East
geographic reporting area, and 5 percent of our total proved reserves were under a variable-royalty regime, located in our Canada
geographic reporting area.
Our reserves disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (Norway and the United Kingdom), Asia
Pacific/Middle East, and Africa.
Reserves Governance
The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB. Proved
reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to
operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods
are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably
certain it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
Proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can
be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the
required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and
infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped
reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a
relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved
reserves. This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world. As part of our
internal control process, each business unit’s reserves
 
153
Table of Contents
processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company’s Manager of Reserves
Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior
representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business
units’ reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of
documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using
consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible
for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and
is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved
reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.
During 2018, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, were reviewed
by D&M. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls
used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips’ technical
staff presented D&M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves.
The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance
calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria.
Management’s intent in retaining D&M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these
processes and controls. D&M’s opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its
December 31, 2018, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&M’s report
is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the
company’s reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master’s degree in
petroleum engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 25 years of oil and gas industry experience
and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the United States
and several international field locations.
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section
of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the
sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2018, included:
 
 • Revisions: In 2018, downward revisions in Lower 48 were primarily due to changes in development timing for specific
well locations from the unconventional plays and are more than offset by increases in planned well locations in the
unconventional plays in the extensions and discoveries category. Downward revisions in Lower 48 due to development
timing were partially offset by higher prices. Revisions in Alaska, Europe and Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily
due to higher prices. In 2017, revisions in Alaska, Lower 48, Europe and Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to
higher prices. In 2016, revisions in Lower 48 and Alaska were primarily due to lower prices.
 
 • Purchases: In 2018, Alaska purchases were due to the Kuparuk Assets and Western North Slope acquisitions.
 
 • Extensions and discoveries: In 2018, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily due to changes in the
development strategy to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays. Extensions and discoveries in Alaska
were driven by drilling success in Western North Slope. In 2017, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily
due to continued drilling success in the Permian Unconventional, Eagle Ford and Bakken. In 2016, extensions and
discoveries in Alaska were primarily due to drilling success in the Western North Slope, and extensions and discoveries
in Lower 48 were primarily due to continued drilling success in Eagle Ford and Bakken.
 
 • Sales: In 2018, Europe sales were due to the disposition of a subsidiary that held a 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field
in the United Kingdom. In 2017, Canada sales were due to the disposition of a majority of our western Canada assets.

Notable changes in proved natural gas liquids reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2018, included:
 
 • Revisions: In 2018, downward revisions in Lower 48 were primarily due to changes in development timing for specific
well locations from the unconventional plays and are more than offset by increases in planned well locations in the
unconventional plays in the extensions and discoveries category. In 2017, revisions in Lower 48 were primarily due to
higher prices.
 
 • Extensions and discoveries: In 2018, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily due to changes in the
development strategy to add specfic well locations from the unconventional plays. In 2017, extensions and discoveries in
Lower 48 were primarily due to continued drilling success in the Permian Unconventional, Eagle Ford and Bakken.
 
 • Sales: In 2018, Lower 48 sales were primarily due to the disposition of our interests in the Barnett. In 2017, Lower 48
sales were due to the disposition of our interests in the San Juan Basin and Panhandle assets, while Canada sales were
due to the disposition of a majority of our western Canada assets.

Natural gas production in the reserves table may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in our statistics disclosure,
primarily because the quantities above include gas consumed in production operations.
Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2018, included:
 
 • Revisions: In 2018, downward revisions in Lower 48 were primarily due to changes in development timing for specific
well locations from the unconventional plays and are more than offset by increases in planned well locations in the
unconventional plays in the extensions and discoveries category. Downward revisions in Lower 48 due to development
timing were partially offset by higher prices. Revisions in Alaska, Canada, Europe and our equity affiliates in Asia
Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to higher prices. In 2017, revisions in Alaska, Lower 48 and Europe were
primarily due to higher prices. In 2016, revisions in our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due
to lower prices.
 
 • Purchases: In 2018, Alaska purchases were due to the Kuparuk Assets and Western North Slope acquisitions.
 
 • Extensions and discoveries: In 2018, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily due to changes in the
development strategy to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays. Extensions and discoveries in
Canada, Europe and our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily driven by ongoing drilling successes
in Montney, Norway and APLNG, respectively. In 2017, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily due to
continued drilling success in the Delaware, Eagle Ford and Bakken.
 
 • Sales: In 2018, Lower 48 sales were primarily due to the disposition of our interest in Barnett. In 2017, Lower 48 sales
were due to the disposition of our interests in the San Juan Basin and Panhandle assets, while Canada sales were due to
the disposition of a majority of our western Canada assets.

Notable changes in proved bitumen reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2018, included:
 
 • Revisions: In 2018, revisions were primarily due to higher prices at Surmont. In 2017, revisions were primarily due to
higher prices at Surmont. In 2016, for both our consolidated operations and equity affiliates revisions were primarily
related to lower prices which resulted in reserve reductions at Surmont, Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake.
 
 • Extensions and discoveries: In 2017, extensions and discoveries were primarily due to higher prices at Surmont, which
allowed undeveloped reserves previously de-booked due to low prices to be recognized.
 
 • Sales: In 2017, sales were due to the disposition of our 50 percent interest in the FCCL Partnership in Canada.

Natural gas reserves are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas
converts to one BOE.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
We had 1,162 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2018, compared with 1,191 million BOE at year-end 2017.
The following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2018:

Downward revisions were primarily in our Lower 48 segment and were mainly due to changes in development timing for specific
well locations from the unconventional plays. These revisions were partially offset by higher prices in Lower 48 as well as Alaska,
Europe and APME.

Extensions and discoveries were primarily in Lower 48 and were mainly due to changes in the development strategy to add specific
well locations from the unconventional plays.
Purchases were due to the Kuparuk Assets and Western North Slope acquisitions in Alaska. Sales were primarily due to the
disposition of a subsidiary that held a 16.5 percent interest in the Clair Field in the United Kingdom.
At December 31, 2018, our proved undeveloped reserves represented 22 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 24 percent
at December 31, 2017. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2018, relating to the development of proved undeveloped
reserves were $4.6 billion. A portion of our costs incurred each year relates to development projects where the proved undeveloped
reserves will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.
At the end of 2018, approximately 90 percent of total proved undeveloped reserves are currently under development or scheduled
for development within five years of initial disclosure. The remainder are to be developed as parts of major projects ongoing in our
Europe and Asia Pacific/Middle East regions. All major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved
undeveloped reserves convert to proved developed over time. Approximately 77 percent of our total proved undeveloped reserves
at year-end 2018 are in North America, and all these reserve volumes are planned for development within five years of initial
disclosure.
Results of Operations
The company’s results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the following
tables. Non-oil and gas activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, crude oil and gas
marketing activities, and the profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are excluded.
Additional information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:
 
 • Sales include sales to unaffiliated entities attributable primarily to the company’s net working interests and royalty
interests. Sales are net of fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final delivery
point using transportation operations which are not consolidated.
 
 • Transportation costs reflect fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final
delivery point using transportation operations which are consolidated.
 
 • Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of
hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.
 
 • Production costs include costs incurred to operate and maintain wells, related equipment and facilities used in the
production of petroleum liquids and natural gas.
 
 • Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.
 
 • Depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.
 
 • Other related expenses include inventory fluctuations, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other
miscellaneous expenses.

Average sales prices for Alaska crude oil and Asia Pacific/Middle East natural gas above reflect a reduction for transportation costs in which we have an ownership
interest that are incurred subsequent to the terminal point of the production function. Accordingly, the average sales prices differ from those discussed in Item 7 of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Development and Exploration Activities
The following two tables summarize our net interest in productive and dry exploratory and development wells in the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. A “development well” is a well drilled within the proved area of a reservoir to the depth of a
stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. An “exploratory well” is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in
an unknown field or a new reservoir within a proven field. Exploratory wells also include wells drilled in areas near or offsetting
current production, or in areas where well density or production history have not achieved statistical certainty of results. Excluded
from the exploratory well count are stratigraphic-type exploratory wells, primarily relating to oil sands delineation wells located in
Canada and coalbed methane test wells located in Asia Pacific/Middle East.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities
In accordance with SEC and FASB requirements, amounts were computed using 12-month average prices (adjusted only for
existing contractual terms) and end-of-year costs, appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor.
Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each
month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic
conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data
becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations
also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves and the timing and amount of future development
costs, including dismantlement, and future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.
While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair
estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

• The net change in prices and production costs is the beginning-of-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual
change in the per-unit sales price and production cost, discounted at 10 percent.
 
• Purchases and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions, discoveries and improved recovery, are calculated using
production forecasts of the applicable reserve quantities for the year multiplied by the 12-month average sales prices, less future
