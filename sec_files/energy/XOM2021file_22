PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil
operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world. Their principal business involves exploration
for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs
in support of these businesses.
Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso,
Mobil or XTO. For convenience and simplicity, in this report the terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO, as well as terms
like Corporation, Company, our, we and its, are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of
affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question.
The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive, both within the industries and also with other industries in
supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industrial and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms
in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of
competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes.
Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the
following: “Note 18: Disclosures about Segments and Related Information” and “Operating Information”. Information on oil and
gas reserves is contained in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and
Production Activities” portion of the Financial Section of this report.
ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments. ExxonMobil held nearly 9 thousand active
patents worldwide at the end of 2020. For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $130 million in
2020. Although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the profitability of
each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.
ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive and changing global energy business environment where decisions and
risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the Corporation's
philosophy on talent development.
Talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training
designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle. Our career-oriented
approach to talent development results in strong retention and an average length of service of 30 years for our career employees.
Compensation, benefits and workplace programs support the Corporation's talent management approach, and are designed to attract
and retain employees for a career through compensation that is market competitive, long-term oriented, and highly differentiated by
individual performance.
Sixty percent of our global employee workforce is from outside the U.S., and over the past decade 39 percent of our global hires for
management, professional and technical positions were female and 31 percent of our U.S. hires for management, professional and
technical positions were minorities. With over 160 nationalities represented in the Company, we encourage and respect diversity of
thought, ideas and perspective from our workforce. We consider and monitor diversity through all stages of employment, including
recruitment, training and development of our employees. We also work closely with the communities where we operate to identify
and invest in initiatives that help support local needs, including local talent and skill development.
The number of regular employees was 72 thousand, 75 thousand, and 71 thousand at years ended 2020, 2019, and 2018,
respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who
work full time or part time for the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs.
As discussed in item 1A. Risk Factors in this report, compliance with existing and potential future government regulations,
including taxes, environmental regulations, and other government regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the
production and sale of our products, may have material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of
ExxonMobil. With respect to the environment, throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to
prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground, including, but not limited to, compliance with
environmental regulations. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean
fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2020
worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity
company expenditures, were $4.5 billion, of which $3.4 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital
expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $4.9 billion in 2021 and 2022. Capital
expenditures are expected to account for approximately 25 percent of the total.

information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
ExxonMobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical
businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the Company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial
and operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include:
 
Supply and Demand
The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined
products. Oil, gas, petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions
that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material
adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the Upstream segment, financial condition, and proved
reserves. On the other hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the
Company’s operations, especially in the Downstream and Chemical segments.
Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities
and levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a
direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as
changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, trade tariffs, security or public health
issues and responses, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign
debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or
restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the
functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets
and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil. Demand reduction due to the COVID-
19 pandemic as well as accompanying conditions of oversupply have led to a significant decrease in commodity prices and
margins. Future business results, including cash flows and financing needs, will be affected by the extent and duration of these
conditions and the effectiveness of responsive actions that the Corporation and others take, including actions to reduce capital and
operating expenses, and actions taken by governments and others to address the COVID-19 pandemic including the ongoing
development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and the impact of the pandemic on national and global economies and
markets.
Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our
results, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of, or
government policy support for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as technological
advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation; changes in consumer preferences for
our products, including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products; and
broad-based changes in personal income levels.
Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For
example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from
existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in
demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce
margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce
available supplies, such as adherence by countries to OPEC production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns,
government policies that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs, and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions,
natural disasters, disruptions in competitors’ operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels
that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and
gas and to manufacture petrochemicals.
Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest
rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions.
2
Government and Political Factors
ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.
Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, including by restricting leasing or permitting
activities, or may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase
to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies.
Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices, when national
governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain
products based on point of origin.
Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the United States or by other
jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain
countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to
competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions.
Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted, or
may be unable to maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of legal certainty exposes our operations
to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our
contracts. In some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the
adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.
Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal systems where ExxonMobil does business, we
remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law (including changes that result from international treaties and
accords) that could adversely affect our results, such as:
•increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims);
•price controls;
•changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available
business opportunities (including changes in laws affecting offshore drilling operations, water use, methane emissions,
hydraulic fracturing or use of plastics);
•actions by regulators or other political actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and permits or restrict the transportation
of our products;
•adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards, the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;
•adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive
commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries; and
•government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations,
renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
Legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.
We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation, especially in countries such as the United States in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur; by government enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance
with applicable laws or regulations; or by state and local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that
attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas, gain political notoriety, or obtain monetary awards from the
Company.
Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or
terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security
or to shut down operations for a period of time.
Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. Driven by concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have
adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or production and use of oil
and gas. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements,
restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Political and other actors
and their agents also increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the availability
of or increase the cost for, financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in
business strategy for oil and gas companies. Depending on how policies are formulated and applied, they could have the potential
to negatively affect investment returns, make our products more expensive or less competitive, lengthen project implementation
times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as
natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs, such as for
monitoring or sequestering emissions.
3
Alternative energy. Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support transitioning to alternative
energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. Governments and others are also promoting research into
new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research
both in-house and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world, including the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Princeton University, The University of Texas, and Stanford University in the U.S., and in Singapore with Nanyang
Technological Institute and the National University. Our research projects focus on developing advanced biofuels and hydrogen,
carbon capture and storage, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials, and other technologies in
collaboration with our partners including Synthetic Genomics, FuelCell Energy and Global Thermostat. Our future results may
depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business
model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. See “Operational and Other Factors” below.
 
Operational and Other Factors
In addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully
those factors that are at least in part within our control. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance
relative to competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more
co-venturers whom we do not control.
Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of
our exploration and development efforts. Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most
promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and
within budget.
Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses
depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of project management
expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate
successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir
performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the development of effective spot
markets; manage changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling
rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay
project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does
not perform that role. In addition to the effective management of individual projects, ExxonMobil’s success, including our ability to
mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio,
including diversification among types and locations of our projects and strategies to divest assets. We may not be able to divest
assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies. Additionally, we may retain certain liabilities following a
divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated.
The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning
as in any government payment transparency reports.
Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, especially given the commodity-
based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and improve
production yields on an ongoing basis. This requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of
high caliber employees.
Research and development and technological change. To maintain our competitive position, especially in light of the
technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil’s research and
development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including
developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and
capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large
amounts of data to our businesses.
Safety, business controls, and environmental risk management. Our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the
inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential
for human error. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other
adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations
integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. Similarly,
we are implementing cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities. We also maintain a disciplined framework of
internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework. Substantial liabilities
and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended.
4
Cybersecurity. ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors including
state-sponsored actors. ExxonMobil’s defensive preparedness includes multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and
detection of cybersecurity disruptions; non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and
industry groups; internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on
resiliency including business response and recovery. If the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions
prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected, ExxonMobil as well as our customers, employees, or
third parties could be adversely affected. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment;
damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost, or stolen; result in
employee, customer, or third-party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We could incur
significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting
regulatory actions, litigation or reputational harm.
Preparedness. Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events. For
example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas.
Our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety
factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity,
marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and
earthquakes. Our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering
uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these
events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and
response, and business continuity planning.
Insurance limitations. The ability of the Corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this Item 1A is
limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.
Competition. As noted in Item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. We face competition not
only from other private firms, but also from state-owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of
their home countries and as partners with other private firms. In some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue opportunities
in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by
private shareholders, such as ExxonMobil. Technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the
competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of ExxonMobil or reduce the need for resource-
owning countries to partner with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources.
Reputation. Our reputation is an important corporate asset. An operating incident, significant cybersecurity disruption, change in
consumer views concerning our products, or other adverse event such as those described in this Item 1A may have a negative
impact on our reputation, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities, obtain
necessary regulatory approvals, obtain financing, or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products. ExxonMobil’s
reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole.
Projections, estimates, and descriptions of ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 2, 7 and 7A
of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project completion dates, production rates, capital
expenditures, costs, and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors discussed above and
elsewhere in this report.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows:
1. Disclosure of Reserves
A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-End 2020
The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated
subsidiaries and equity companies. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million
barrels. The Corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month
during the last 12-month period. Primarily as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital
expenditures, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas that qualified as
proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Otherwise, no major discovery or other
favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2020, that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved
reserves as of that date.

In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the
Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated
subsidiaries.
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir
performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset
sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that
may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on
rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as
flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received
significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably
certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including
completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and
significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of
low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their
share of joint projects.
During the first and second quarters of 2020, the balance of supply and demand for petroleum and petrochemical products
experienced two significant disruptive effects. On the demand side, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of
the world resulting in substantial reductions in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil,
natural gas, and petroleum products. This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain
key oil-producing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and
petroleum products. Market conditions continued to reflect considerable uncertainty throughout 2020.
As noted above, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not
qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen
at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in the United States. The Corporation's
near-term reduction in capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved reserves of approximately 1.5 billion
oil-equivalent barrels, mainly related to unconventional drilling in the United States. Among the factors that could result in portions
of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost
reductions, operating efficiencies, and increases in planned capital spending.
B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2020
Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2020 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and
appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the
field to yield repeatable and consistent results.
Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and
performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including
high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data
included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially
available data analysis packages.
In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to
increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.

C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves
ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the
operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance
with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the
reporting of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s
proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to
personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the
Global Reserves and Resources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a
degree in Engineering and currently serves on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE).
The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry,
including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who
hold degrees in either Engineering or Geology.
The Global Reserves and Resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates.
Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within
this central database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves
estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and
long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of
any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by
duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves
estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the
operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and
Resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made,
reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.
2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At year-end 2020, approximately 5.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as
proved undeveloped. This represents 33 percent of the 15.2 GOEB reported in proved reserves. This compares to the 7.7 GOEB of
proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2019. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities that
resulted in the transfer of approximately 0.9 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end. The
largest transfers were related to development activities in the United States, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Guyana. During
2020, extensions, primarily in the United States and Canada, resulted in an addition of approximately 0.5 GOEB of proved
undeveloped reserves. Also, as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures, the
Corporation reclassified approximately 2.3 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the SEC definition of
proved reserves, primarily in the United States and Canada.
Overall, investments of $10.7 billion were made by the Corporation during 2020 to progress the development of reported proved
undeveloped reserves, including $10.4 billion for oil and gas producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-
oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments
represented 74 percent of the $14.4 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.
One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments
toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long
lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved
undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped
reserves in Australia, Kazakhstan, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates have remained undeveloped for five years or
more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very
large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount
recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory
approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and
timing of capital investments, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves
that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Australia, proved
undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Kazakhstan, the proved
undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the Tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production
license in the Tengiz - Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will
continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the United Arab Emirates, proved undeveloped
reserves are associated with an approved development plan and continued drilling investment for the producing Upper Zakum field.

Average production prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor.
Average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and
natural gas liquids (NGL) production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3.A. The
volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in
section 3.A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas
Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial
Section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic
feet per one thousand barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas Resources Extracted by Mining Technologies
Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining
methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude
oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent
interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2020, the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about 68 thousand
barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to
extract the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada
Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100
percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in
the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands and
processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our
refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to
facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2020, average net production at Kearl was about 219 thousand barrels per day.
Primarily as a result of very low prices during 2020, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, the entire 3.1 billion barrels of
bitumen at Kearl did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Among the factors that could result in portions of these
amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost
reductions, and/or operating efficiencies.

may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also enters into natural
gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and
the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 31 million barrels of oil and 2,600 billion
cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2021 through 2023. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments
with production from our proved developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled with production from our
proved undeveloped reserves and purchases on the open market as necessary.

ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks, and leases. The
terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production rights to the acreage are property-
specific, contractually defined, and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the
exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish
acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for
extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful
in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is
not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.
D. Summary of Acreage Terms
UNITED STATES
Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners
include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period
ranging from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases. Under certain
circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding
private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.
CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS
Canada
Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These
licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license
and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in
offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a
term of nine years. Offshore production licenses are valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production.
Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.
Argentina
The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in 2014. Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for an onshore
unconventional concession is 35 years, and 25 years for a conventional concession, with unlimited 10-year extensions possible,
once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years,
divided into two exploration periods of four years, with an optional extension of five years for each license. Two onshore
exploration concessions were initially granted prior to the amendment and are governed under Provincial Law with expiration
terms through 2024.
Guyana
The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act authorizes the government of Guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and
production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Petroleum
agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years and a production period of 20 years, with a 10-year extension.
EUROPE
Germany
Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions up to
three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20
to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license.
Netherlands
Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities
for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.
Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and
offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as
explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a
fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40
years.
20
United Kingdom
Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the
end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in
producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case
basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently
issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18
years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a
development plan at the end of the second term.
Terms for exploration acreage in technically challenged areas are governed by frontier production licenses, generally covering a
larger initial area than traditional licenses, with an initial exploration term of six or nine years with a second term extension of six
years, and a final production term of 18 years, with relinquishment of 75 percent of the original area after three years and 50
percent of the remaining acreage after the next three years. Innovate licenses issued replace traditional and frontier licenses and
offer greater flexibility with respect to periods and work program commitments.
AFRICA
Angola
Exploration and production activities are governed by either production sharing agreements or other contracts with initial
exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from
20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.
Chad
Exploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and
conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30
years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.
Equatorial Guinea
Exploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the State
Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. A new PSC was ratified in 2018; the initial exploration period is five years for oil and gas,
with multi-year extensions available at the discretion of the Ministry and limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial
discoveries. The production period for crude oil ranges from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for natural gas ranges from
25 to 50 years.
Mozambique
Exploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the Government of the Republic of
Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. An interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was
acquired in 2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed by the Exploration and Production Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4
Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given
discovery area.
In 2018, an interest was acquired in offshore blocks, A5-B, Z5-C and Z5-D. Terms for the three blocks are governed by their
respective EPCCs, which have an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 with the possibility of two additional exploration
phases expiring in 2024 and 2026. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the
approval of a plan of development.
Nigeria
Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs)
with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil
Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a
10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL.
Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of
the 10-year exploration period, and OMLs have a 20-year production period that may be extended.
Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs
in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years, while in all other areas the licenses are for five years. Demonstrating a
commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.
21
OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were
for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed, effective December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20
years, with a further renewal option of 20 years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a joint venture
agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by
the Petroleum Profits Tax Act.
OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without
distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12-months written notice, for another period of 20 years.
OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first 10 years of their duration.
ASIA
Azerbaijan
The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field was established for an initial
period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by
25 years to 2049.
Other exploration and production activities are governed by PSAs negotiated with the national oil company of Azerbaijan. The
exploration period typically consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one to three-year extension. The production
period, which includes development, is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year extensions.
Indonesia
Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a
production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil
and gas activities. In 2012, Indonesia’s Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to BPMIGAS to be
unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions
and duties previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry of the Government of Indonesia until
the promulgation of a new oil and gas law. By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The
current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years.
PSCs generally require the contractor to relinquish 10 to 20 percent of the contract area after three years and generally allow the
contractor to retain no more than 50 to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending on the acreage and terms.
Iraq
Development and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies
of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil
for the rights to participate in the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March
1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-
barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.
Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs)
negotiated with the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for five years, with extensions available as
provided by the PSCs and at the discretion of the regional government of Kurdistan. Current PSCs remain in effect by agreement of
the regional government to allow additional time for exploration or evaluation of commerciality. The production period is 20 years
with the right to extend for five years.
Kazakhstan
Onshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration license, and joint venture
agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that
commenced in 1993.
Offshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period
for each discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of
two 10-year extensions.
Malaysia
Production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have
production terms of 25 years. Extensions are generally subject to the national oil company’s prior written approval.
22
Qatar
The State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these
projects.
Russia
Terms for ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the current production sharing agreement between the Russian government
and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator.
Thailand
The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under ExxonMobil’s concessions for 30 years with a 10-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time. The term of one of the two concessions expires in 2021.
United Arab Emirates
An interest in the development and production activities of the offshore Upper Zakum field was acquired in 2006. In 2017, the
governing agreements were extended to 2051.
AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA
Australia
Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation.
Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be
granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially viable
within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses
were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field.
Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely. In each case, a production license may be terminated if
no production operations have been carried on for five years.
Papua New Guinea
Exploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial
term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances).
Generally, a 50-percent relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended. Petroleum
development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the Minister’s
discretion. Petroleum retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of
application, but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years. Petroleum retention
licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of
15 years. Extensions of petroleum retention licenses may be for periods of less than one year, renewable annually, if the Minister
considers at the time of extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five years.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS
Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions are
provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.
Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales
Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with
sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of
assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that assets are contributing to the
Corporation’s strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably
more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated
with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business
and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Cash flow from operations and asset sales 15,667 33,408 40,137 
 
Capital Employed
Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it
includes ExxonMobil’s net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and
long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes
ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity
companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.

Return on Average Capital Employed
Return on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments,
ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-
of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with
our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is net income attributable to
ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has
consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in our
capital-intensive, long-term industry. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment decisions.

OVERVIEW
The following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil’s financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and
related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil
Corporation. The Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration
for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products.
ExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-
positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies. The company’s integrated business model, with
significant investments in Upstream, Downstream and Chemical segments, generally reduces the Corporation’s risk from changes
in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis,
ExxonMobil’s investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a
disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting operating and capital objectives in
addition to providing the economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. Volume projections are based on
individual field production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Price ranges for crude oil, natural gas, refined
products, and chemical products are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are utilized for
investment evaluation purposes. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. Once
major investments are made, a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are
incorporated into future projects.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Long-Term Business Outlook
Given the uncertainty around the near-term impacts of COVID-19 on economic growth, energy demand and energy supply, and
lack of precedent, the Company is considering a range of recovery pathways to guide near-term plans. These pathways expect that
energy demand will grow beyond 2019 levels as early as 2022 reflecting the phase out of COVID-19 impacts and re-establishment
of long-term supply/demand fundamentals. The Corporation’s Outlook for Energy combined with the near-term pathways are used
to help inform our long-term business strategies and investment plans.
By 2040, the world’s population is projected at around 9.1 billion people, or about 1.6 billion more than in 2018. Coincident with
this population increase, the Corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average close to 2.5 percent per year, with
economic output growing by around 75 percent by 2040. As economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for
billions of people, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand
is projected to rise by more than 10 percent from 2018 to 2040. This increase in energy demand is expected to be driven by
developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD)).
As expanding prosperity helps drive global energy demand higher, increasing use of energy efficient technologies and practices as
well as lower-emission products will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions per unit of economic
output over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting energy
requirements for power generation, transportation, industrial applications, and residential and commercial needs.
Global electricity demand is expected to increase approximately 50 percent from 2018 to 2040, with developing countries likely to
account for about 85 percent of the increase. Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the largest and
fastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand, supported by a wide variety of energy sources. The share of coal
fired generation is likely to decline substantially and approach 20 percent of the world’s electricity in 2040, versus nearly 40
percent in 2018, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the risks
related to climate change. From 2018 to 2040, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables
is likely to nearly double, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and offsetting the reduction of coal. Electricity
from wind and solar is likely to increase about 400 percent, helping total renewables (including other sources, e.g. hydropower) to
account for about 80 percent of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide through 2040. Total renewables will likely reach
about 50 percent of global electricity supplies by 2040. Natural gas and nuclear are also expected to increase shares over the period
to 2040, reaching more than 25 percent and about 10 percent of global electricity supplies respectively by 2040. Supplies of
electricity by energy type will reflect significant differences across regions reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and
availability of various energy supplies and policy developments.
Energy for transportation – including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes – is expected to increase by about 20 percent from
2018 to 2040. Transportation energy demand is likely to account for over 60 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand
worldwide over this period. Light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak prior to 2025 and then decline to levels
seen in the early-2010s by 2040 as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by China, Europe,
and the United States, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of about 60 percent. By 2040, light-duty vehicles are
expected to account for about 20 percent of global liquid fuels demand. During the same time period, nearly all the world’s
commercial transportation fleets are likely to continue to run on liquid fuels, which are widely available and offer practical
advantages in providing a large quantity of energy in small volumes.
Liquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting broad-based availability, affordability, ease of
transportation, and fitness as a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. By 2040, global demand for liquid fuels is
projected to grow to approximately 110 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of about 9 percent from 2018. The
non-OECD share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to about 65 percent by 2040, as liquid fuels demand in the
OECD is likely to decline by close to 15 percent. Much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production from
traditional conventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to offset
much of the natural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources – including tight oil,
deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels – are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. The world’s resource base
is sufficient to meet projected demand through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic and
lower carbon supply options. However, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable
supplies.
40
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Natural gas is a lower-emission, versatile and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications, and it is expected to grow the most of
any primary energy type from 2018 to 2040, meeting about 50 percent of global energy demand growth. Global natural gas demand
is expected to rise about 25 percent from 2018 to 2040, with about half of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region.
Significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas – the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations – will help
meet these needs. In total, about 55 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. At
the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply, meeting more than two
thirds of worldwide demand in 2040. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade will expand significantly, meeting about 40 percent of the
increase in global demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.
The world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2040. Oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy
with its share remaining close to 30 percent in 2040. Coal is currently the second largest source of energy, but it is likely to lose that
position to natural gas in the next few years. The share of natural gas is expected to reach more than 25 percent by 2040, while the
share of coal falls to about two thirds of the natural gas share. Nuclear power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations are
likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues. Total
renewable energy is likely to exceed 15 percent of global energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal contributing a
combined share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly,
growing over 350 percent from 2018 to 2040, when they will likely be just over 6 percent of the world energy mix.
The Corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also
from increases in previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these increases. The investments to develop and supply
resources to meet global demand through 2040 will be significant – even if demand remains flat. This reflects a fundamental aspect
of the oil and natural gas business as the International Energy Agency (IEA) describes in its World Energy Outlook 2020. According
to the IEA’s Stated Energy Policies Scenario, the investment required to meet oil and natural gas supply requirements worldwide
over the period 2019-2040 will be about $17 trillion (measured in 2019 dollars). In the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario,
which is in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the investment need would still accumulate to $12
trillion.
International accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with
uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has taken into
account policies established to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook for Energy. The climate
accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging.
Our Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related policies,
which often target specific sectors. It estimates potential impacts of these policies on consumer energy demand by using various
assumptions and tools – including, depending on the sector, application of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies
(e.g. automotive fuel economy standards). For purposes of the Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO emissions is assumed
to reach about $80 per tonne in 2040 in OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD
policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to
need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need. The Corporation continues to
monitor the updates to the NDCs that nations are expected to provide in preparation for COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021 as
well as other policy developments in light of net zero ambitions recently formulated by some nations.
The information provided in the Long-Term Business Outlook includes ExxonMobil’s internal estimates and projections based
upon internal data and analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources including the International Energy
Agency.
Positioning for a Lower-Carbon Energy Future
Practical solutions to the world’s energy and climate challenges will benefit from market competition in addition to well-informed,
well-designed, and transparent policy approaches that carefully weigh costs and benefits. Such policies are likely to help manage
the risks of climate change while also enabling societies to pursue other high priority goals around the world – including clean air
and water, access to reliable and affordable energy, and economic progress for all people. ExxonMobil encourages sound policy
solutions that reduce climate-related risks across the economy at the lowest societal cost. All practical and economically-viable
energy sources will need to be pursued to continue meeting global energy demand, recognizing the scale and variety of worldwide
energy needs as well as the importance of expanding access to modern energy to promote better standards of living for billions of
people.
ExxonMobil is committed to advancing sustainable, effective solutions that address both the world’s growing demand for energy
and the risks of climate change. The Company’s plans aim for industry-leading greenhouse gas performance across its businesses
by 2030. These plans include a reduction of the intensity of operated upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 15 to 20 percent in
2025, compared to 2016 levels, which will be supported by a 40 to 50 percent decrease in methane intensity and a 35 to 45 percent
decrease in flaring intensity across the Corporation’s global operations. The 2025 emission reduction plans are expected to result in
a reduction of absolute emissions by approximately 30 percent for the Company’s current Upstream business by 2025 when
compared to 2016 levels. The emission plans cover Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from assets operated by the Corporation.2
41
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Commercially viable technology advances will be needed to achieve the Paris Agreement objectives at the lowest societal cost.
While many potential pathways exist, ExxonMobil cannot predict how these objectives will become achievable given the range of
uncertainties. ExxonMobil is working to develop breakthrough solutions in areas such as carbon capture, biofuels, hydrogen, and
energy-efficiency process technology that can help achieve the Paris Agreement objectives. In early 2021 ExxonMobil announced
the creation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize low-carbon technologies. The business will
initially focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), one of the critical technologies required to achieve the climate objectives
outlined in the Paris Agreement. In addition to CCS, the business will also leverage ExxonMobil’s significant experience in the
production of hydrogen which, when coupled with CCS, is likely to play a critical role in a lower-carbon energy system. Other
technology focus areas will be added in the future as they mature to commercialization.
Upstream
ExxonMobil continues to sustain a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which enables the
Corporation to be selective, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil’s fundamental
strategies guide our global Upstream business, including capturing material and accretive opportunities to continually high-grade
the resource portfolio, selectively developing attractive oil and natural gas resources, developing and applying high-impact
technologies, and pursuing productivity and efficiency gains. These strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational
excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the communities within which we operate.
As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the
geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on current investment plans, the
proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Further, the
proportion of our global production from unconventional and deepwater resources, as well as LNG currently contributes nearly half
of global production, and is generally expected to grow in the next few years.
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir
performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset
sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that
may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility. Market demand and prices experienced sharp
decline in the first half of 2020 largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this decline, prices increased in the second
half of the year as supply and demand began to rebalance. ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven
by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity,
technology advances, consumer preference and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by
political events, the actions of OPEC and other large government resource owners, and other factors. To manage the risks
associated with price, ExxonMobil evaluates annual plans and major investments across a range of price scenarios.
In 2020, the Upstream business produced 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day and matched best-ever reliability performance
with continued focus on delivering best in class operations in all aspects of the business while prioritizing cash flow generation and
return on investment. Government-mandated and economic curtailments negatively impacted 2020 production by approximately
0.2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Significant progress was made on key new developments in Guyana and in the Permian
basin during 2020. In Guyana, exploration success continued with three additional discoveries increasing the estimated recoverable
resource to nearly 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels on the Stabroek block. In the Permian, despite economic curtailments and reduced
capital investment, production volumes averaged 367 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2020, a 35 percent year-on-year
production increase which exceeded expectations, while development and operating costs were significantly reduced. Also in the
Permian, we started up the Delaware basin central processing and stabilization facility which enhances the company’s integration
advantages by collecting and processing oil and natural gas for delivery to Gulf Coast markets. 
Downstream
ExxonMobil’s Downstream is a large, diversified business with global logistics, trading, refining, and marketing. The Corporation
has a well-established presence in the Americas, Europe, and growing Asia Pacific region.
Downstream strategies competitively position the business across a range of market conditions. These strategies focus on providing
quality, differentiated, and valued products and services to customers, targeting best in class operations performance, capitalizing
on integration across all ExxonMobil businesses, maximizing value from advantaged technology, and selectively investing for
resilient, advantaged returns.
ExxonMobil’s operating results, as noted in Item 2. Properties, reflect 21 refineries, located in 14 countries, with distillation
capacity of 4.8 million barrels per day (MBD) and lubricant base stock manufacturing capacity of 129 thousand barrels per day.
ExxonMobil’s fuels and lubes value chains have significant global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse
customer base. Our portfolio of world-renowned brands includes Exxon, Mobil, Esso, Synergy, and Mobil 1.
42
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Fuels demand in 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter downturn, global
demand for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel declined about 23 percent versus 2019. While demand partially recovered in the second
half of the year, fourth quarter total products demand remained 10 percent below 2019 levels. This unprecedented demand impact
adversely affected refining margins resulting in historically low market conditions, with announced refinery closures four times
higher than 10-year historical levels. In the near-term, refining margins will continue to be impacted by COVID-19 demand
recovery. Finished lubricant demand was also impacted by COVID-19, with ExxonMobil’s estimate of industry demand down 5 to
10 percent versus 2019.
Refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery
pays for its raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced. Crude oil and many products are widely traded
with published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange and
Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many
factors, including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import/export
balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather, and political climate.
ExxonMobil’s long-term outlook is that industry refining margins will remain volatile subject to shifting consumer demand as well
as capacity changes from refinery additions and closures. ExxonMobil’s significant integration both within the Downstream value
chains including lubricants, logistics, trading, refining, and marketing, as well as with Upstream and Chemical, improves our ability
to generate shareholder value in different market conditions.
As described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, proposed carbon policy and other climate related regulations in many countries, as well as
the continued growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the Downstream business.
ExxonMobil continually evaluates the Downstream portfolio during all phases of the business cycle, which has resulted in
numerous asset divestments over the past decade to strengthen overall profitability and resiliency. When investing in the
Downstream, ExxonMobil remains focused on select and resilient projects across a broad range of market conditions. In 2020, the
Strathcona Cogeneration project started up to improve refinery energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition,
the main segment of the Wink to Webster pipeline system, operated by ExxonMobil Pipeline Company, started transporting
Permian crude from Midland to Houston. Finally, deferral costs associated with pacing previously announced Downstream projects
will be offset with efficiencies captured during the market downturn.
ExxonMobil continues to grow fuels product sales in new markets near major production assets with continued progress in the
Mexico and Indonesia market entries. The lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging world class brands and integration with
industry leading basestock refining capability. Through the Mobil branded properties, such as Mobil 1, ExxonMobil is the
worldwide leader in synthetic motor oils.
Chemical
ExxonMobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals, including a wide variety of performance products that
sustainably support improved living standards around the globe. ExxonMobil sustains its competitive advantage through continued
operational excellence, investment and cost discipline, a balanced portfolio of products, and unparalleled integration with
Downstream and Upstream operations, all underpinned by proprietary technology.
In 2020, many markets were heavily impacted by COVID-19, however demand for chemical products remained resilient in several
key segments including food packaging, hygiene and medical. Overall Chemical margins improved compared to 2019 due to lower
feedstock costs, continued strong packaging demand, and industry supply disruptions through the second half of 2020. We were
uniquely positioned to capture value from the market volatility in 2020 due to our integration, enabling nimble feed and product
optimization. This, in addition to our outstanding safety and reliability performance and structural cost improvement, delivered
industry leading earnings.
Over the long term, demand for chemical products is forecast to outpace growth in global GDP and energy demand. ExxonMobil
estimates that worldwide demand for chemicals will rise by over 40 percent by 2030, driven by continued global population growth
and an expanding middle class. ExxonMobil’s integration with refining, together with our high-value performance products and
unique project execution capability, enhances our ability to generate industry-leading returns on investments across a range of
market environments. In 2020, construction progressed on our joint venture ethane cracker and associated units near Corpus
Christi, Texas. The project is below budget and expected to start up ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter of 2021. We made the
decision to slow the pace of other U.S. Gulf Coast growth projects, capturing current market efficiencies to offset deferral costs. In
addition, we continued to progress plans for a world-scale steam cracker and performance derivative units in Guangdong Province,
China.
43
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
REVIEW OF 2020 AND 2019 RESULTS
During the first and second quarters of 2020, the balance of supply and demand for petroleum and petrochemical products
experienced two significant disruptive effects. On the demand side, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of
the world resulting in substantial reductions in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil,
natural gas, and petroleum products. This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain
key oil-producing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and
petroleum products.
Market conditions continued to reflect considerable uncertainty throughout 2020 as consumer and business activity exhibited some
degree of recovery, but remained lower when compared to prior periods as a result of the pandemic. Despite actions taken by key
oil-producing countries to reduce oversupply, the unfavorable economic impacts are likely to persist to some extent well into 2021.

Upstream earnings were $14,442 million, up $363 million from 2018.
•Lower realizations reduced earnings by $2.7 billion.
•Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $860 million.
•All other items increased earnings by $2.2 billion, as a $3.7 billion gain from the Norway non-operated divestment was
partly offset by higher expenses of $1.1 billion.
•U.S. Upstream earnings were $536 million and included asset impairments of $146 million.
•Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $13,906 million, including the $3.7 billion gain from the Norway non-operated
divestment.
•On an oil-equivalent basis, production of 4.0 million barrels per day was up 3 percent compared to 2018.
•Liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day increased 120,000 barrels per day reflecting growth and higher
entitlements.
•Natural gas production of 9.4 billion cubic feet per day decreased 11 million cubic feet per day from 2018, with the impact
from divestments and higher downtime offset by growth and higher entitlements.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to
volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon
achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result
of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent
events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes
to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability
can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels
are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or
market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels due to temporary non-operational production
limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.
 
Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in
a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.
 
Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may
affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and
work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline,
and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

Total cash and cash equivalents were $4.4 billion at the end of 2020, up $1.3 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds
in 2020 were the adjustment for the noncash provision of $46.0 billion for depreciation and depletion, a net debt increase of
$20.1 billion, proceeds from asset sales of $1.0 billion, and other investing activities of $2.7 billion. The major uses of funds
included a net loss including noncontrolling interests of $23.3 billion, spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of
$17.3 billion, dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion, and additional investments and advances of $4.9 billion.
Total cash and cash equivalents were $3.1 billion at the end of 2019, up $47 million from the prior year. The major sources of funds
in 2019 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $14.8 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $19.0
billion for depreciation and depletion, a net debt increase of $8.7 billion, and proceeds from asset sales of $3.7 billion. The major
uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $24.4 billion, dividends to shareholders of
$14.7 billion, and additional investments and advances of $3.9 billion.
The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Commercial paper continues to provide
short-term liquidity, and is reflected in “Notes and loans payable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in outstanding
commercial paper between periods included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Corporation took steps to strengthen
its liquidity in 2020, including issuing $23.2 billion of long-term debt and implementing significant capital and operating cost
reductions. The Corporation ended the year with $68 billion in gross debt and intends to reduce debt over time. On December 31,
2020, the Corporation had unused short-term committed lines of credit of $11.3 billion and no unused long-term lines of credit.
To support cash flows in future periods the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and
continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase
production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates
for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but
not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the
Corporation’s key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation’s
net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.
The Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in
quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years
providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual
project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes;
the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; and changes in
the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment. The Corporation’s cash flows
are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more complete discussion
of risks.
The Corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. Capital and exploration expenditures
in 2020 were $21.4 billion, reflecting the Corporation’s continued active investment program. The Corporation is prioritizing
opportunities to hold 2021 capital spending in a range of $16 billion to $19 billion.
48
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. The Corporation has a large
and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical
risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of
opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the
Corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments.
The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.
Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either
gains or losses. In light of the current low commodity price environment, and depending on the extent and pace of recovery, the
Corporation's planned divestment program could be adversely affected by fewer financially suitable buyers. This could result in a
slowing of the pace of divestments, certain assets being sold at a price below current book value, or impairment charges if the
likelihood of divesting certain assets increases. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its
business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for
evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash,
shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.
ExxonMobil closely monitors the potential impacts of Brexit and Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) reforms, including LIBOR, under
a number of scenarios and has taken steps to mitigate their potential impact. Accordingly, ExxonMobil does not believe these
events represent a material risk to the Corporation’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
 
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
 
2020
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $14.7 billion in 2020, $15.0 billion lower than 2019. Net income (loss) including
noncontrolling interests was a loss of $23.3 billion, a decrease of $38.0 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and
depletion was $46.0 billion, up $27.0 billion from the prior year, mainly due to asset impairments. The noncash provision for
deferred income tax benefits was $8.9 billion and also included impacts from asset impairments. The adjustment for the net loss on
asset sales was $4 million, a decrease of $1.7 billion. The adjustment for dividends received less than equity in current earnings of
equity companies was an increase of $1.0 billion, compared to a reduction of $0.9 billion in 2019. Changes in operational working
capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash in 2020 by $1.7 billion.
 
2019

Cash Flow from Financing Activities
 
2020
Cash flow from financing activities was $5.3 billion in 2020, $11.9 billion higher than 2019. Dividend payments on common shares
increased to $3.48 per share from $3.43 per share and totaled $14.9 billion. During 2020, the Corporation issued $23.2 billion of
long-term debt. Total debt increased $20.7 billion to $67.6 billion at year-end.
ExxonMobil share of equity decreased $34.5 billion to $157.2 billion. The reduction to equity for losses was $22.4 billion and the
reduction for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders was $14.9 billion, all in the form of dividends. Foreign exchange translation
effects of $1.8 billion for the weaker U.S. dollar and a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits
reserves increased equity.
During 2020, Exxon Mobil Corporation acquired 8 million shares of its common stock for the treasury. Purchases were made to
offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding
decreased from 4,234 million to 4,233 million at the end of 2020.
 
2019
Cash used in financing activities was $6.6 billion in 2019, $12.8 billion lower than 2018. Dividend payments on common shares
increased to $3.43 per share from $3.23 per share and totaled $14.7 billion. During the third quarter of 2019, the Corporation issued
$7.0 billion of long-term debt. Total debt increased $9.1 billion to $46.9 billion at year-end.
ExxonMobil share of equity decreased $0.1 billion to $191.7 billion. The addition to equity for earnings was $14.3 billion. This was
offset by reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $14.7 billion, all in the form of dividends. Foreign exchange
translation effects of $1.4 billion for the weaker U.S. currency increased equity, while a $1.4 billion change in the funded status of
the postretirement benefits reserves reduced equity.
During 2019, Exxon Mobil Corporation acquired 8 million shares of its common stock for the treasury. Purchases were made to

This table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum price) which are resold
shortly after purchase, either in an active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts with similar
pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to
purchase refinery products at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in assessing liquidity and
cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. The table
also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2020, because the Corporation is unable to make
reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Further details on the
unrecognized tax benefits can be found in “Note 19: Income and Other Taxes”.
Notes:
(1)The amount due in 2021 is included in Notes and loans payable of $20,458 million. The amounts due 2022 and beyond are
included in Long-term debt of $47,182 million.
(2)Asset retirement obligations are primarily upstream asset removal costs at the end of field life.
(3)The amount by which the benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for U.S. and non-U.S. pension and other
postretirement plans at year-end. The payments by period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2021 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years.
(4)Commitments for operating and finance leases cover drilling equipment, tankers and other assets.
(5)Take-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase
obligations are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that
third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services. The obligations
mainly pertain to pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements.
(6)Firm capital commitments represent legally binding payment obligations to third parties where agreements specifying all
significant terms have been executed for the construction and purchase of fixed assets and other permanent investments. In
certain cases where the Corporation executes contracts requiring commitments to a work scope, those commitments have been
included to the extent that the amounts and timing of payments can be reliably estimated. Firm capital commitments, shown on
an undiscounted basis, totaled $12.8 billion, including $5.3 billion in the U.S.
Firm capital commitments for the non-U.S. Upstream of $5.9 billion were primarily associated with projects in Guyana,
Angola, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Brazil and United Arab Emirates. The Corporation expects to fund the
majority of these commitments with internally generated funds, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.
51
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Guarantees
The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2020, for guarantees relating
to notes, loans and performance under contracts (Note 16). Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar
matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These
guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
 
Financial Strength
On December 31, 2020, the Corporation had total unused short-term committed lines of credit of $11.3 billion (Note 6) and no
unused long-term lines of credit (Note 14). The table below shows the Corporation’s consolidated debt to capital ratios.
 
 2020 2019 2018
Debt to capital (percent) 29.2 19.1 16.0
Net debt to capital (percent) 27.8 18.1 14.9
 
Management views the Corporation’s financial strength to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. The Corporation’s
financial position gives it the opportunity to access the world’s capital markets in the full range of market conditions, and enables
the Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.
Industry conditions in 2020 led to lower realized prices for the Corporation’s products which resulted in substantially lower
earnings and operating cash flow in comparison to 2019. The Corporation took steps to strengthen its liquidity in 2020, including
issuing $23 billion of long-term debt and implementing significant capital and operating cost reductions. The Corporation ended the
year with $68 billion in gross debt and intends to reduce debt over time.
 
Litigation and Other Contingencies
As discussed in Note 16, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a
number of pending lawsuits. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the
ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already
included in reported financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating results or financial condition.
Refer to Note 16 for additional information on legal proceedings and other contingencies.
CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES
Capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) represents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment,
and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Consolidated Statement of Income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share
of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares
used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and
equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income,
particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Capex in 2020 was $21.4 billion, as the Corporation continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy. The Corporation is prioritizing opportunities to hold 2021 capital spending in a range
of $16 billion to $19 billion. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
Upstream spending of $14.4 billion in 2020 was down 39 percent from 2019 in response to market conditions. Investments in 2020
included the U.S. Permian Basin and key development projects in Guyana. Development projects typically take several years from
the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex
projects. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 67 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2020, and has been over
60 percent for the last ten years.
Capital investments in the Downstream totaled $4.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $0.2 billion from 2019, reflecting lower global
project spending. Chemical capital expenditures of $2.7 billion, decreased $0.5 billion, representing reduced spend on growth
projects.
TAXES

Income taxes (5,632) 5,282 9,532 
Effective income tax rate 17 % 34 % 37 %
Total other taxes and duties 28,425 33,186 35,230 
Total 22,793 38,468 44,762 
2020
Total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement were $22.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of $15.7 billion from 2019. Income tax
expense, both current and deferred, was a benefit of $5.6 billion compared to $5.3 billion expense in 2019. The relative benefit is
driven by asset impairments recorded in 2020. The effective tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income
taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 17 percent compared to 34 percent in the prior year due
primarily to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates. Total other taxes and duties of $28.4 billion in 2020
decreased $4.8 billion.
 
2019
Total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement were $38.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of $6.3 billion from 2018. Income tax
expense, both current and deferred, was $5.3 billion compared to $9.5 billion in 2018. The effective tax rate, which is calculated
based on consolidated company income taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 34 percent compared
to 37 percent in the prior year due primarily to the impact of the divestment of non-operated upstream assets in Norway. Total other
taxes and duties of $33.2 billion in 2019 decreased $2.0 billion.

Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations
on air, water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean
fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2020
worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity
company expenditures, were $4.5 billion, of which $3.4 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital
expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $4.9 billion in 2021 and 2022. Capital
expenditures are expected to account for approximately 25 percent of the total.
Environmental Liabilities
The Corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued
liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the potentially responsible parties. The involvement of
other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate ExxonMobil’s actual joint and several liability
exposure. At present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to ExxonMobil’s operations or financial condition.
Consolidated company provisions made in 2020 for environmental liabilities were $263 million ($290 million in 2019) and the
balance sheet reflects liabilities of $902 million as of December 31, 2020, and $835 million as of December 31, 2019.
MARKET RISKS, INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES
Worldwide Average Realizations (1) 2020 2019 2018
Crude oil and NGL ($ per barrel) 35.41 56.32 62.79 
Natural gas ($ per thousand cubic feet) 2.01 3.05 3.87 
(1) Consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces. The impacts
of these price fluctuations on earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. In the Upstream, a
$1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $475 million annual after-tax effect
on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic
feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $165 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream
consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit
or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other
government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly,
changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in
any particular period.
In the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than
absolute price levels of products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw
materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances and weather.
54
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the
Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times
associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position. Management views the
Corporation’s financial strength as a competitive advantage.
In general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where
such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated refinery/chemical complexes.
Additionally, intersegment sales are at market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired
in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity, and transportation capabilities. Refer to Note 18 for additional
information on intersegment revenue.
Although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global
economic conditions, political events, decisions by OPEC and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry
economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. Accordingly, the Corporation evaluates the
viability of its major investments over a range of prices.
The Corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels
or considered for divestment. The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure that assets are
contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives.
Risk Management
The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream
and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and
interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk
and for trading purposes. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the
Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial
position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, or results of operations for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018. Credit risk associated
with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the
quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. No material market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial
position, results of operations or liquidity exist as a result of the derivatives described in Note 13. The Corporation maintains a
system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
The Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that
carries floating interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be
material to earnings or cash flow. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt
as required. Commercial paper is used to balance short-term liquidity requirements. Some joint-venture partners are dependent on
the credit markets, and their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.
The Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales,
expenses, financing and investment transactions. Fluctuations in exchange rates are often offsetting and the impacts on
ExxonMobil’s geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied. The Corporation makes limited use of currency
exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and exposures related to the Corporation’s use of these
contracts are not material.
Inflation and Other Uncertainties
The general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained moderate over the past few years, and the
associated impact on non-energy costs has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity
improvements. Prices for services and materials continue to evolve in response to constant changes in commodity markets and
industry activities, impacting operating and capital costs. However, the global COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020 has brought
unprecedented uncertainties to near-term economic outlooks. The Corporation continues to monitor market trends and works to
minimize costs in all commodity price environments through its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project
management practices.
RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
During 2020, ExxonMobil conducted an extensive global review of staffing levels and subsequently commenced targeted
workforce reductions within a number of countries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The programs, which are expected to be
substantially complete by the end of 2021, include both voluntary and involuntary employee separations and reductions in
contractors.
In 2020 the Corporation recorded before-tax charges of $450 million ($349 million after tax), consisting primarily of employee
separation costs, associated with announced workforce reduction programs in Europe, North America, and Australia. These costs
are captured in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Statement of Income and reported in the Corporate and
financing segment. Before-tax cash outflows in 2020 associated with these activities were $47 million. The Corporation estimates
additional charges of up to $200 million in 2021 related to planned workforce reduction programs with cash outflows ranging
between $400 million and $600 million. Before-tax workforce reduction savings, including employees and contractors, are
estimated to range between $1 billion and $2 billion per year after program completion when compared to 2019 levels.
55
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and
production of, crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products,
petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting
policies are summarized in Note 1.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations,
commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines,
development and production costs, among other factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through
long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level
geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group which has significant technical
experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific
quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of
Reserves in Item 2.
Oil and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves.
•Proved oil and natural gas reserves are determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
requirements. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering
data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating
conditions and government regulations. Proved reserves are determined using the average of first-of-month oil and natural
gas prices during the reporting year.
Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves include
amounts which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved
undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves are recognized
only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless
specific circumstances support a longer period of time.
The percentage of proved developed reserves was 67 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2020 (including both
consolidated and equity company reserves), an increase from 66 percent in 2019, and has been over 60 percent for the last
ten years. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount
recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance,
regulatory approvals, government policy, consumer preferences and significant changes in oil and natural gas price levels.
•Unproved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include
probable reserves. Probable reserves are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
Revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of
(1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the
average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also
result from significant changes in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity.
Unit-of-Production Depreciation
Oil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream
assets. Depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved developed reserves applied to
actual production. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to
some variability.
56
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an
upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method may be used in limited situations where the expected life of
the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil
and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset
is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.
To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the
resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated
using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful
quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.
Impairment
The Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Among the events or changes in circumstances which
could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following:
•a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
•a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition including a
significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes;
•a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including an adverse action
or assessment by a regulator;
•an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
•a current-period operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
•a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before
the end of its previously estimated useful life.
Asset valuation analyses, profitability reviews and other periodic control processes assist the Corporation in assessing whether
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable.
In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes
that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices
will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand
fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to
generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment
activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general
economic activities and levels of prosperity. Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are
measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and
development and production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation expects that oil and gas prices will
experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower
earnings, or even losses.
In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the
Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices. While near-term prices are
subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows.
When the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions
may result in changes to the Corporation’s price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment decisions. To the extent
those changes result in a significant reduction to its oil price, natural gas price or margin ranges, the Corporation may consider that
situation, in conjunction with other events or changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of
potential impairment for certain assets.
57
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas
Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. These prices represent
discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation’s price assumptions which are used for impairment
assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash
flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and
therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an
impairment assessment.
The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year.
This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation’s planning and
budgeting cycle. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the
Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts.
In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the
Corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria
management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation’s assumptions of future
capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins,
volumes, development and operating costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility
production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management’s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows
makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for
impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value. Impairments are
measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair value requires the use of Level 3
inputs and assumptions that are based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair
value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based
estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models
include estimates of future production volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry
experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs, and discount rates ranging from 6 percent to 8 percent which are
reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.
Unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired. Significant unproved properties are
assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's
future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the
properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and
average holding period.
In 2020, the Corporation identified a number of situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying
value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Those situations primarily related to the annual review and approval of
the Corporation's business and strategic plan. As part of the planning process, the Corporation assessed its full portfolio to prioritize
assets with the highest future value potential within its broad range of available opportunities in order to optimize resources within
current levels of debt and operating cash flow, as well as identify potential asset divestment candidates. This effort included a re-
assessment of dry gas assets, primarily in North America, which previously had been included in the Corporation’s future
development plans. Under the plan as approved, the Corporation no longer plans to develop a significant portion of its dry gas
portfolio, including a portion of its resources in the Appalachian, Rocky Mountains, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas
regions of the U.S. as well as resources in Western Canada and Argentina. The decision not to develop these assets resulted in non-
cash, after-tax charges of $18.4 billion in Upstream to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. Other after-tax
impairment charges in 2020 include $0.5 billion in Upstream and $0.3 billion in Downstream. As a result of these impairments, the
Corporation expects lower 2021 depreciation and depletion charges in Upstream for most of these asset groups. However, largely
due to the impact of lower 2020 proved reserves resulting from low prices, higher unit-of-production rates on certain assets in 2021
are expected to offset the effect of lower depreciation and depletion charges related to 2020 impairments. For further discussion on
proved reserves, see Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves in the Disclosure of Reserves section in Item 2.
Factors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include reductions in the Corporation’s price outlooks,
changes in the allocation of capital, and operating cost increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural
gas price increases. However, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between
industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment
charges related to the Corporation’s long-lived assets. For discussion of goodwill and equity company impairments, see Note 3 and
Note 7 to the financial statements, respectively.
 
58
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a
discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses
assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical
assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement
obligations are disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements.
Suspended Exploratory Well Costs
The Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. The facts
and circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end are disclosed in Note 10 to the financial
statements.
Consolidations
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the Corporation controls. They also include the
Corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing
the Corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are accounted for
using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in companies that are partially owned by the Corporation are integral to the Corporation’s operations. In some cases
they serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others they provide the only available means of entry into a particular market or area
of interest. The other parties, who also have an equity interest in these companies, are either independent third parties or host
governments that share in the business results according to their ownership. The Corporation does not invest in these companies in
order to remove liabilities from its balance sheet. In fact, the Corporation has long been on record supporting an alternative
accounting method that would require each investor to consolidate its share of all assets and liabilities in these partially-owned
companies rather than only its interest in net equity. This method of accounting for investments in partially-owned companies is not
permitted by U.S. GAAP except where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share of upstream assets and liabilities.
However, for purposes of calculating return on average capital employed, which is not covered by U.S. GAAP standards, the
Corporation includes its share of debt of these partially-owned companies in the determination of average capital employed. 
Pension Benefits
The Corporation and its affiliates sponsor about 80 defined benefit (pension) plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefits footnote (Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.
Some of these plans (primarily non-U.S.) provide pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of
corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage
advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is
expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is
expensed over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for
unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on
fund assets.
For funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance
arrangements. These plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meet or exceed
required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement dates. In
determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those
used for accounting purposes.
The Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations,
regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the
respective sponsoring affiliate.
Pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the
discount rate for the benefit obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases. Pension assumptions are reviewed
annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market
rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2020 was 5.3 percent. The 10-year and 20-
year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the long-
term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking
into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is
then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset
class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by
approximately $210 million before tax.
59
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Differences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the
year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into
pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.
Litigation Contingencies
A variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending
lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for
accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.
The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. These accrued liabilities are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or
claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. The
Corporation revises such accruals in light of new information. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably
possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the
possible loss. For purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other items
which management believes should be disclosed.
Management judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict.
However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect
on operations or financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards
are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.
Tax Contingencies
The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. Significant management judgment is
required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict.
The benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in
the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax
authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest
amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. A reserve is established for the difference between a position taken
or expected to be taken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The Corporation’s
unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in Note 19.
Foreign Currency Translation
The method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars
is prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency of these subsidiaries. The
functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment.
Factors considered by management when determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash
flows related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of
inflation in the country; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor, services
and supplies; sources of financing; and significance of intercompany transactions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Corporation”)
as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in
equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Corporation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Corporation's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the
Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
The Impact of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
As described in Notes 1, 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation’s consolidated upstream property, plant
and equipment (PP&E), net balance was $167.5 billion as of December 31, 2020, and the related depreciation and depletion
expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $41.4 billion. Management uses the successful efforts method to account for its
exploration and production activities. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether unproved or
proved) are capitalized when incurred. As disclosed by management, proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the
basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. The estimation of proved oil and natural gas
reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of
well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, development and production costs, among other factors. As
further disclosed by management, reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level
geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group (together “management’s
specialists”).
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and natural gas
reserves on upstream PP&E, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of
management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes, as the reserve volumes are
based on engineering assumptions and methods, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort
in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its
specialists in developing the estimates of oil and natural gas reserve volumes and the assumptions applied to the data related to
future development costs and production costs, as applicable.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management's estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management's specialists was used in
performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for using
this work, the specialists' qualifications were understood and the Company's relationship with the specialists was assessed. The
procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the
specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists' findings. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness
and accuracy of the data related to future development costs and production costs. Additionally, these procedures included
evaluating whether the assumptions applied to the data related to future development costs and production costs were reasonable
considering the past performance of the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Impairment Assessment of Certain Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
As described in Notes 1, 9, and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation’s consolidated upstream property, plant
and equipment (PP&E), net balance was $167.5 billion as of December 31, 2020, and related impairment expense for the year
ended December 31, 2020 was $25.3 billion. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable, management estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability
of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are
largely independent of cash flows of other groups of assets. These evaluations make use of management’s assumptions of future
capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, volumes, development and operating
costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the
asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Management’s
estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include
risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessment of certain
upstream PP&E, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when
developing the estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in
performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to future crude oil and natural gas commodity
prices, production volumes, and development costs, as applicable.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management’s upstream PP&E, net impairment assessment. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing
management’s process for assessing the recoverability of carrying amounts of upstream PP&E, net; (ii) evaluating the
appropriateness of the undiscounted cash flow models; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the
models; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to future crude oil and
natural gas commodity prices, production volumes, and development costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s
assumptions related to future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices involved comparing the assumption against observable
market data. Evaluating future development costs involved evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions as compared to the
past performance of the Company. The work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the
reasonableness of the proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes as stated in the Critical Audit Matter titled “Impact of Proved Oil
and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment, Net” and the reasonableness of the future production
volumes. As a basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the
specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the
specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility of the
management of Exxon Mobil Corporation.
The Corporation’s principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade,
transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Prior years’ data has been reclassified in certain
cases to conform to the 2020 presentation basis.
1. Summary of Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Accounting for Investments
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the Corporation controls. They also include the
Corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing
the Corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in
“Investments, advances and long-term receivables”. The Corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in
the Consolidated Statement of Income caption “Income from equity affiliates”.
Majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain
factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. These factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive
participating rights. These include the right to approve operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and
management compensation and succession plans.
Evidence of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies accounted for on the equity method is
assessed to determine if such evidence represents a loss in value that is other than temporary. Examples of key indicators include a
history of operating losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the
financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment or geographic region. If evidence of an other than temporary
loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is recognized. In the absence of market prices for the
investment, discounted cash flows are used to assess fair value.
Investments in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investments are measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Corporation uses the modified approach for equity securities that do not have a
readily determinable fair value. This modified approach measures investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions in a similar investment of the same issuer.
The Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income”.
Revenue Recognition
The Corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at
prevailing market prices. In some cases (e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic price
adjustments to reflect market conditions. Revenue is recognized at the amount the Corporation expects to receive when the
customer has taken control, which is typically when title transfers and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of
ownership. The prices of certain sales are based on price indices that are sometimes not available until the next period. In such
cases, estimated realizations are accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is available. Such
adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods are not significant. Payment for revenue
transactions is typically due within 30 days. Future volume delivery obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are
expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchases. These performance obligations are based on market prices at the
time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to market price volatility.
Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and
recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold.
“Sales and other operating revenue” and “Notes and accounts receivable” primarily arise from contracts with customers. Long-term
receivables are primarily from non-customers. Contract assets are mainly from marketing assistance programs and are not
significant. Contract liabilities are mainly customer prepayments and accruals of expected volume discounts and are not significant.
70
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Income and Other Taxes
The Corporation excludes from the Consolidated Statement of Income certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and
concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes,
for which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both
“Sales and other operating revenue” and “Other taxes and duties”).
The Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is
incurred.
Derivative Instruments
The Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices,
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that arise from existing assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted
transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value.
Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met.
Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the
derivative. All gains and losses from derivative instruments for which the Corporation does not apply hedge accounting are
immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value
hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings.
For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive
income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
Fair Value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. Hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
Hierarchy Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy Level 2 inputs are inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy Level
3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Inventories
Crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined
under the last-in, first-out method – LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly
and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and
administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are
valued at cost or less.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Cost Basis. The Corporation uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under
this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property
(whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found
a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where the Corporation is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these
criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed
as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the
unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into
consideration.
Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil
and natural gas reserve volumes. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable
extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and
gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production
method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or
sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. In the event that the unit-of-production method does
not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-
line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the
underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves,
and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.
71
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the
resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated
using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful
quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.
Investments in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-
line basis over a 25-year life. Service station buildings and fixed improvements generally are depreciated over a 20-year life.
Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are
capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.
Impairment Assessment. The Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Among the events or changes in
circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following:
•a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
•a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition including a
significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes;
•a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including an adverse
action or assessment by a regulator;
•an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
•a current-period operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
•a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly
before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
Asset valuation analysis, profitability reviews and other periodic control processes assist the Corporation in assessing whether
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable.
In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes
that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices
will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand
fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to
generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment
activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general
economic activities and levels of prosperity. Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are
measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and
development and production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation expects that oil and gas prices will
experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower
earnings, or even losses.
In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the
Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices. While near-term prices are
subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows.
When the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions
may result in changes to the Corporation’s price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment decisions. To the extent
those changes result in a significant reduction to its oil price, natural gas price or margin ranges, the Corporation may consider that
situation, in conjunction with other events or changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of
potential impairment for certain assets.
In the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas
Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. These prices represent
discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation’s price assumptions which are used for impairment
assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash
flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and
therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an
impairment assessment.
72
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year.
This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation’s planning and
budgeting cycle. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the
Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts.
In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the
Corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria
management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation’s assumptions of future
capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins,
volumes, development and operating costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility
production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management’s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows
makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for
impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value. Impairments are
measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is based on market prices if an active market
exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk.
Unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired. Significant unproved properties are
assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's
future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the
properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and
average holding period.
Other. Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery
of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future performance by the Corporation. Losses on
properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than
the carrying value.
Interest costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the
historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed
engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in
property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.
Environmental Liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures
are not discounted.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary
economic environment in which each subsidiary operates.
Downstream and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history
of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly sells into the U.S. dollar export market.
Upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country, such as Canada, the United
Kingdom and continental Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S.
dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.
For all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in
income.

2. Accounting Changes
Effective January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s update, Financial Instruments –
Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended. The standard requires a valuation allowance for credit losses be recognized for certain
financial assets that reflects the current expected credit loss over the asset’s contractual life. The valuation allowance considers the
risk of loss, even if remote, and considers past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standard
requires this expected loss methodology for trade receivables, certain other financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures.
The cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of this standard reduced ExxonMobil's share of equity by $93 million.
The Corporation is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural
gas, as well as loans to equity companies and joint venture receivables. A counterparty’s ability to pay is assessed through a credit
review process that considers payment terms, the counterparty’s established credit rating or the Corporation’s assessment of the
counterparty’s credit worthiness, contract terms, country of operation, and other risks. The Corporation can require prepayment or
collateral to mitigate certain credit risks.
The Corporation groups financial assets into portfolios that share similar risk characteristics for purposes of determining the
allowance for credit losses and assesses if a significant change in the risk of credit loss has occurred. Among the quantitative and
qualitative factors considered are historical financial data, current conditions, industry and country risk, current credit ratings and
the quality of third-party guarantees secured from the counterparty. Financial assets are written off in whole, or in part, when
practical recovery efforts have been exhausted and no reasonable expectation of recovery exists. Subsequent recoveries of amounts
previously written off are recognized in earnings. The Corporation manages receivable portfolios using past due balances as a key
credit quality indicator.
The Corporation recognizes a credit allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures as a liability on the balance sheet, separate
from the allowance for credit losses related to recognized financial assets. Among these exposures are unfunded loans to equity
companies and financial guarantees that cannot be cancelled unilaterally by the Corporation.

Mainly as a result of declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products in 2020 and a significant decline in its
market capitalization at the end of the first quarter, the Corporation recognized before-tax goodwill impairment charges of $611
million in Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical reporting units. Fair value of the goodwill reporting units primarily reflected
market-based estimates of historical EBITDA multiples at the end of the first quarter. Charges related to goodwill impairments are
included in “Depreciation and depletion” on the Statement of Income.

The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year.
This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation’s planning and
budgeting cycle. In 2020, the Corporation identified a number of situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that
the carrying value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Those situations primarily related to the annual review and
approval of the Corporation's business and strategic plan. As part of the planning process, the Corporation assessed its full portfolio
to prioritize assets with the highest future value potential within its broad range of available opportunities in order to optimize
resources within current levels of debt and operating cash flow, as well as identify potential asset divestment candidates. This effort
included a re-assessment of dry gas assets, primarily in North America, which previously had been included in the Corporation’s
future development plans. Under the plan as approved, the Corporation no longer plans to develop a significant portion of its dry
gas portfolio, including a portion of its resources in the Appalachian, Rocky Mountains, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas
regions of the U.S., as well as resources in Western Canada and Argentina. The decision not to develop these assets resulted in non-
cash, before-tax charges of $24.4 billion in Upstream to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. Other before-tax
impairment charges in 2020 included $0.9 billion in Upstream, $0.5 billion in Downstream, and $0.1 billion in Chemical.
Impairment charges are primarily recognized in the lines “Depreciation and depletion” and “Exploration expenses, including dry
holes” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
The assessment of fair value requires the use of Level 3 inputs and assumptions that are based upon the views of a likely market
participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production
metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows.
Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, commodity prices
which were consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs,
and discount rates ranging from 6 percent to 8 percent which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.
Factors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include reductions in the Corporation’s price outlooks,
changes in the allocation of capital, and operating cost increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural
gas price increases. However, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between
industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment
charges related to the Corporation’s long-lived assets. In 2019 and 2018, the before-tax impairment charges were $0.1 billion and
$0.7 billion, respectively.
Accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $277,769 million at the end of 2020 and $233,684 million at the end of 2019.
Interest capitalized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $665 million, $731 million and $652 million, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a
discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses
assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical
assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement
obligations incurred in the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements. The costs associated with these liabilities are
capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the
change in their present value.
Asset retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are permanently
shut down and dismantled. These obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation. However,
these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal
obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.
The following table summarizes the activity in the liability for asset retirement obligations:

10. Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Well Costs
The Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
The following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended exploratory well costs as well as an aging
summary of those costs.

Capitalized for a period greater than one year - subtotal 4,174 4,081 3,596 
Total 4,382 4,613 4,160 
 
Exploration activity often involves drilling multiple wells, over a number of years, to fully evaluate a project. The table below
provides a breakdown of the number of projects with only exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less and
those that have had exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year.

Total 37 50 58 
 
Of the 34 projects that have exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2020,
13 projects have drilling in the preceding year or exploratory activity planned in the next two years, while the remaining 21 projects
are those with completed exploratory activity progressing toward development.

11. Leases
The Corporation and its consolidated affiliates generally purchase the property, plant and equipment used in operations, but there
are situations where assets are leased, primarily for drilling equipment, tankers, office buildings, railcars, and other moveable
equipment. Right of use assets and lease liabilities are established on the balance sheet for leases with an expected term greater than
one year by discounting the amounts fixed in the lease agreement for the duration of the lease which is reasonably certain,
considering the probability of exercising any early termination and extension options. The portion of the fixed payment related to
service costs for drilling equipment, tankers and finance leases is excluded from the calculation of right of use assets and lease
liabilities. Generally, assets are leased only for a portion of their useful lives, and are accounted for as operating leases. In limited
situations assets are leased for nearly all of their useful lives, and are accounted for as finance leases.
Variable payments under these lease agreements are not significant. Residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants related to
leases, and transactions with related parties are also not significant. In general, leases are capitalized using the incremental
borrowing rate of the leasing affiliate. The Corporation’s activities as a lessor are not significant.

The increase in the estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $23 billion of long-
term debt during 2020.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $504 million and $379 million of collateral under master
netting arrangements not offset against the derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to initial margin
requirements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the
Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices,
currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage
commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated
Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue”. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are
not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of
which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, or results of operations for the years
ended 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative
clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system
of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, was as follows:

14. Long-Term Debt
At December 31, 2020, long-term debt consisted of $41,026 million due in U.S. dollars and $6,156 million representing the U.S.
dollar equivalent at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. These amounts exclude that portion of long-
term debt, totaling $2,930 million, which matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. The increase in the
estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $23 billion of long-term debt during
2020. The amounts of long-term debt, excluding finance lease obligations, maturing in each of the four years after December 31,
2021, in millions of dollars, are: 2022 – $3,340; 2023 – $4,024; 2024 – $3,968; and 2025 – $4,672. At December 31, 2020, the
Corporation had no unused long-term lines of credit.
The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to
foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation
has designated its $5.5 billion of Euro-denominated long-term debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its
European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.

15. Incentive Program
The 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and other
forms of awards. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned.
Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and SARs
may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The
maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited,
expire, or are settled in cash, do not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term.
New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. At the end of 2020,
remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 71 million.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Awards totaling 8,681 thousand, 8,936 thousand, and 8,771 thousand of restricted
(nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is
based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these
awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in
fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or
transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and
units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven years. Awards granted to a small
number of senior executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years for the remaining 50
percent of the award, except that for awards granted prior to 2020 the vesting of the 10-year portion of the award is delayed until
retirement if later than 10 years.
The Corporation has purchased shares in the open market and through negotiated transactions to offset shares or units settled in
shares issued in conjunction with benefit plans and programs. The Corporation suspended its first quarter 2021 anti-dilutive share
repurchase program due to current market uncertainty and intends to resume this program in the future as market conditions
improve.

16. Litigation and Other Contingencies
Litigation. A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of
pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the
need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those
contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be
reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is
accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies
where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the
contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant”
includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not
believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the
Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
Other Contingencies. The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2020,
for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other
similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business
activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or
financial condition.
In accordance with a Venezuelan nationalization decree issued in February 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil
Company (PdVSA) assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. The decree also required conversion of the
Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project.
ExxonMobil refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government expropriated
ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project.
ExxonMobil collected awards of $908 million in an arbitration against PdVSA under the rules of the International Chamber of
Commerce in respect of an indemnity related to the Cerro Negro Project and $260 million in an arbitration for compensation due
for the La Ceiba Project and for export curtailments at the Cerro Negro Project under rules of International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID). An ICSID arbitration award relating to the Cerro Negro Project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) was
annulled based on a determination that a prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why the cap on damages in the indemnity owed
by PdVSA did not affect or limit the amount owed for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project. ExxonMobil filed a new claim
seeking to restore the original award of damages for the Cerro Negro Project with ICSID on September 26, 2018.
The net impact of this matter on the Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the
Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.

An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the
operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding
NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the
Contractors initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a
three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages
to the Contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The Contractors
petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside.
On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial
Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21,
2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against
NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary.
Following dismissal by this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June 2016. In October 2014, the
Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC moved to dismiss the lawsuit. On September 4,
2019, the SDNY dismissed the Contractors’ petition to recognize and enforce the Erha arbitration award. The Contractors filed a
notice of appeal in the Second Circuit on October 2, 2019. At this time, the net impact of this matter on the Corporation's
consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the
Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the Corporation's operations or financial condition.

respectively.
 
For selection of the discount rate for U.S. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest rate market
indicators and the effective discount rate determined by use of a yield curve based on high-quality, noncallable bonds applied to the
estimated cash outflows for benefit payments. For major non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is determined by using a spot yield curve
of high-quality, local-currency-denominated bonds at an average maturity approximating that of the liabilities.
The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5 percent in 2022
and subsequent years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The funding levels of all qualified pension plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or regulation. As shown in
the table below, certain smaller U.S. pension plans and a number of non-U.S. pension plans are not funded because local applicable
tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. All defined benefit pension obligations, regardless of the
funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring
affiliate.

The long-term expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established for each benefit plan by developing a forward-
looking, long-term return assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the
specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.

The Corporation’s investment strategy for benefit plan assets reflects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the risks inherent in
plan assets and liabilities and broad diversification to reduce the risk of the portfolio. The benefit plan assets are primarily invested
in passive global equity and local currency fixed income index funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. The equity funds
hold ExxonMobil stock only to the extent necessary to replicate the relevant equity index. The fixed income funds are largely
invested in investment grade corporate and government debt securities.
Studies are periodically conducted to establish the preferred target asset allocation percentages. The target asset allocation for the
U.S. benefit plans and the major non-U.S. plans is 30 percent equity securities and 70 percent debt securities. The equity for the
U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans include a small allocation to private equity partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage venture
capital of 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
The fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different methods of valuing assets. The terms do not represent
the relative risk or credit quality of an investment.

18. Disclosures about Segments and Related Information
The Upstream, Downstream and Chemical functions best define the operating segments of the business that are reported separately.
The factors used to identify these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are undertaken by each
segment. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. The Chemical segment is organized and operates to
manufacture and sell petrochemicals. These segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical industries.
These functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Corporation because they are the segments (1) that engage in
business activities from which revenues are recognized and expenses are incurred; (2) whose operating results are regularly
reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and
to assess its performance; and (3) for which discrete financial information is available.
Earnings after income tax include transfers at estimated market prices.
In the Corporate and financing segment, interest revenue relates to interest earned on cash deposits and marketable securities.
Interest expense includes non-debt-related interest expense of $148 million in 2020, $105 million in 2019 and $84 million in 2018.

The Corporation’s undistributed earnings from subsidiary companies outside the United States include amounts that have been
retained to fund prior and future capital project expenditures. Deferred income taxes have not been recorded for potential future tax
obligations, such as foreign withholding tax and state tax, as these undistributed earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested
for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.
However, unrecognized deferred taxes on remittance of these funds are not expected to be material.
105
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unrecognized Tax Benefits. The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. Unrecognized
tax benefits reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns and the amounts
recognized in the financial statements. The following table summarizes the movement in unrecognized tax benefits: 
Gross unrecognized tax benefits 2020 2019 2018
 (millions of dollars)
Balance at January 1 8,844 9,174 8,783 
Additions based on current year's tax positions 253 287 375 
Additions for prior years' tax positions 218 120 240 
Reductions for prior years' tax positions (201) (97) (125)
Reductions due to lapse of the statute of limitations (237) (279) (5)
Settlements with tax authorities (113) (538) (68)
Foreign exchange effects/other — 177 (26)
Balance at December 31 8,764 8,844 9,174 
The gross unrecognized tax benefit balances shown above are predominantly related to tax positions that would reduce the
Corporation’s effective tax rate if the positions are favorably resolved. Unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally
would not increase the effective tax rate. The 2020, 2019 and 2018 changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material
effect on the Corporation’s net income.
Resolution of these tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax authorities or through litigation will take many years to
complete. It is difficult to predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such timing is not entirely within the control of the
Corporation. In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The Corporation filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in U.S. federal
district court (District Court) with respect to the positions at issue for those years. These positions are reflected in the unrecognized
tax benefits table above. On February 24, 2020, the Corporation received an adverse ruling on this suit. The IRS has asserted
penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the
Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. On January 13, 2021, the District Court ruled that
no penalties apply to the Corporation's positions in this suit. Proceedings in the District Court are continuing. Unfavorable
resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations or
financial condition.
It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease by 10 percent in the next 12
months.
The following table summarizes the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction:

Papua New Guinea 2008— 2020
Russia 2018— 2020
United Kingdom 2015— 2020
United States 2006— 2020
The Corporation classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense or interest income and classifies tax-related
penalties as operating expense.
For 2020, the Corporation's net interest expense was a credit of $6 million on income tax reserves. The Corporation incurred $0
million and $3 million in interest expense on income tax reserves in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The related interest payable
balances were $61 million and $71 million at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

20. Restructuring Activities
During 2020, ExxonMobil conducted an extensive global review of staffing levels and subsequently commenced targeted
workforce reductions within a number of countries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The programs, which are expected to be
substantially completed by the end of 2021, include both voluntary and involuntary employee separations and reductions in
contractors.
In 2020 the Corporation recorded before-tax charges of $450 million, consisting primarily of employee separation costs, associated
with announced workforce reduction programs in Europe, North America, and Australia. These costs are captured in “Selling,
general and administrative expenses” on the Statement of Income and reported in the Corporate and financing segment. The
Corporation estimates additional charges of up to $200 million in 2021 related to planned workforce reduction programs.
The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to the workforce reduction programs, which are recorded in
“Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.”

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs
The amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated subsidiaries are $13,206 million less at year-end 2020 and $13,082
million less at year-end 2019 than the amounts reported as investments in property, plant and equipment for the Upstream in Note
9. This is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of certain transportation and research assets and assets relating to LNG
operations. Assets related to oil sands and oil shale mining operations are included in the capitalized costs in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board rules.

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs (continued)
The amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs charged to expense during the year. Costs incurred
also include new asset retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or decreases to the asset retirement
obligation resulting from changes in cost estimates or abandonment date. Total consolidated costs incurred in 2020 were $11,254
million, down $7,986 million from 2019, due primarily to lower development costs including lower asset retirement obligation cost
estimates mainly in Angola. In 2019, costs were $19,240 million, up $2,912 million from 2018, due primarily to higher
development costs, partially offset by lower acquisition costs of unproved properties. Total equity company costs incurred in 2020
were $2,012 million, down $904 million from 2019, due primarily to lower development costs.

Oil and Gas Reserves
The following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2018, 2019
and 2020.
The definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.
Proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering
data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs,
and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new
investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules, the Corporation’s year-end reserves volumes as well as
the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the
12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-
production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.
Revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to
the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or
production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation
of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility
capacity.
During the first and second quarters of 2020, the balance of supply and demand for petroleum and petrochemical products
experienced two significant disruptive effects. On the demand side, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of
the world resulting in substantial reductions in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil,
natural gas, and petroleum products. This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain
key oil-producing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and
petroleum products. Market conditions continued to reflect considerable uncertainty throughout 2020.
Primarily as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures, under the SEC definition
of proved reserves, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not
qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen
at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in the United States. The Corporation's
near-term reduction in capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved reserves of approximately 1.5 billion
oil-equivalent barrels, mainly related to unconventional drilling in the United States. Among the factors that could result in portions
of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost
reductions, operating efficiencies, and increases in planned capital spending.
Proved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation in proved reserves and ExxonMobil’s
ownership percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas
reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at
gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.
In the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation
does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.
Reserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined
by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary
inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the
company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of
the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total liquids and natural gas proved
reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2020 that were associated with production sharing contract
arrangements was 15 percent of liquids, 14 percent of natural gas and 15 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted
to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels).
Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net
proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
Crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil’s oil
and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing
function as reported in the Operating Information due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows
As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is
computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices, year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10
percent to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation
obligations. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected
future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil
and gas reserves. The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of-the-
month average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from
year to year as prices change.
