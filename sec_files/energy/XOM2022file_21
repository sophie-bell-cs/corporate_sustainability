PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil
operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world. Our principal business involves exploration
for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including
carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of
these businesses.
Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso,
Mobil or XTO. For convenience and simplicity, in this report the terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO, as well as terms
like Corporation, Company, our, we, and its, are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of
affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question.
The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive, both within the industries and also with other industries in
supplying the energy, fuel, and chemical needs of industrial and individual consumers. Certain industry participants, including
ExxonMobil, are expanding investments in lower-emission energy and emission-reduction services and technologies. The
Corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes.
Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the
following: “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Business Results” and “Note
18: Disclosures about Segments and Related Information”. Information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “Oil and Gas
Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial
Section of this report.
ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments. ExxonMobil held over 8 thousand active patents
worldwide at the end of 2021. For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $66 million in 2021.
Although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the profitability of each
business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise, or concession.
ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive, and changing global energy business environment where decisions and
risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the Corporation's
philosophy on talent development.
Talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training
designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle. Our career-oriented
approach to talent development results in strong retention and an average length of service of 30 years for our career employees.
Compensation, benefits, and workplace programs support the Corporation's talent management approach, and are designed to
attract and retain employees for a career through compensation that is market competitive, long-term oriented, and highly
differentiated by individual performance.
Over 60 percent of our global employee workforce is from outside the U.S., and over the past decade 39 percent of our global hires
for management, professional and technical positions were female and 35 percent of our U.S. hires for management, professional
and technical positions were minorities. With over 160 nationalities represented in the company, we encourage and respect diversity
of thought, ideas, and perspective from our workforce. We consider and monitor diversity through all stages of employment,
including recruitment, training, and development of our employees. We also work closely with the communities where we operate
to identify and invest in initiatives that help support local needs, including local talent and skill development.
The number of regular employees was 63 thousand, 72 thousand, and 75 thousand at years ended 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical, and wage employees who
work full time or part time for the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs.
1
As discussed in item 1A. Risk Factors in this report, compliance with existing and potential future government regulations,
including taxes, environmental regulations, and other government regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the
production and sale of our products, may have material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of
ExxonMobil. With respect to the environment, throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to
prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water, and ground, including, but not limited to, compliance with
environmental regulations. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean
fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2021
worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity
company expenditures, were $4.6 billion, of which $3.4 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital
expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $5.3 billion in 2022, with capital
expenditures expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total. Costs for 2023 are anticipated to be higher as the Low
Carbon Solutions business matures and the Corporation progresses its emission-reduction plans.
Information concerning the source and availability of raw materials used in the Corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in
the business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of governments, and risks attendant
to foreign operations may be found in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 2. Properties” in this report.
ExxonMobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 are made available through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file or furnish the reports
to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also available on the Corporation’s website are the company’s Corporate
Governance Guidelines, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, and additional policies as well as the charters of the audit,
compensation, and other committees of the Board of Directors. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report.
The SEC maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other
information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
ExxonMobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical
businesses, and the pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities. Many of these risk factors are not within the company’s
control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors
include:
Supply and Demand
The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined
products. Oil, gas, petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions
that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a
material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations, especially in the Upstream segment, financial condition, and proved
reserves. On the other hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the
company’s operations, especially in the Downstream and Chemical segments.
Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities
and levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a
direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as
changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government regulation or austerity programs, trade tariffs or broader
breakdowns in global trade, security or public health issues and responses, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact
the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or
legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union,
and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil,
including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to
ExxonMobil.
COVID-19. The initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic caused conditions of demand reduction and oversupply to develop
rapidly and resulted in significant decreases in commodity prices and margins. ExxonMobil’s future business results, including cash
flows and financing needs, will be affected by the scope and severity of current and future COVID outbreaks; actions taken by
governments and others to address the pandemic and the effects of those actions on national and global economies and markets;
changes in consumer behavior that affect demand for our products; and the effectiveness of the Corporation’s own responsive
actions to protect the safety and well-being of our people.
2
Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our
results, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of, or
government policy support for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as technological
advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation; changes in consumer preferences for
our products, including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products; and
broad-based changes in personal income levels. See also “Climate Change and the Energy Transition” below.
Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For
example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from
existing sources tends to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in
demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce
margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce
available supplies, such as the level of and adherence by participating countries to production quotas established by OPEC or
"OPEC+" and other agreements among sovereigns, government policies, including actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs, and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural
disasters, disruptions in competitors’ operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may
disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and
to manufacture petrochemicals.
Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest
rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. Market factors may also result in losses
from commodity derivatives and other instruments we use to hedge price exposures or for trading purposes.
Government and Political Factors
ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.
Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, including by restricting leasing or permitting
activities, or may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase
to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies.
Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices, when national
governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain
products based on point of origin.
Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the United States or by other
jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain
countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to
competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions.
Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted, or
may be unable to maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of legal certainty exposes our operations
to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our
contracts. In some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the
adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.
Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal systems where ExxonMobil does business, we
remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law (including changes that result from international treaties and
accords) and changes in policy that could adversely affect our results, such as:
•increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims);
•price controls;
•changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available
business opportunities (including changes in laws affecting offshore drilling operations, water use, methane emissions,
hydraulic fracturing, or use of new or recycled plastics);
•actions by policy-makers, regulators, or other actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and permits, restrict the
availability of oil and gas leases or the transportation of our products, or otherwise require changes in the company's
business or strategy that could result in reduced returns;
•adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards, the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;
•adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive
commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries; and
•government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations,
renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
Legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.
3
We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation, especially in countries such as the United States in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur; by government enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance
with applicable laws or regulations; or by state and local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that
attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas (including seeking to reduce the production and sale of
hydrocarbon products though litigation targeting the company or other industry participants), gain political notoriety, or obtain
monetary awards from the company.
Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or
terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, the application of national security laws or policies that result in restricting our ability to do
business in a particular jurisdiction, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for
security or to shut down operations for a period of time.
Climate Change and the Energy Transition
Net-zero scenarios. Driven by concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the
adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from the production and use of oil and
gas and their products. These actions are being taken both independently by national and regional governments and within the
framework of United Nations Conference of the Parties summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed
objectives to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2 over the coming decades, with an ambition ultimately to achieve “net-
zero.” Net-zero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such
gases from the atmosphere. Expectations for transition of the world’s energy system to lower emission sources and ultimately net-
zero derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the future and reflect substantial uncertainties. The
company’s objective to lead in the energy transition, including the company’s announced ambition ultimately to achieve net-zero
with respect to emissions from operations where ExxonMobil is the operator, carries risks that the transition, including underlying
technologies, policies, and markets as discussed in more detail below, will not develop at the pace or in the manner expected by
current net-zero scenarios. The success of our strategy for the energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key
signposts of change in the global energy system on a timely basis, and our corresponding ability to direct investment to the
technologies and businesses, at the appropriate stage of development, to best capitalize on our competitive strengths.
Greenhouse gas restrictions. Government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include adoption of cap and trade
regimes, carbon taxes, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased mileage and other
efficiency standards, mandates for sales of electric vehicles, mandates for use of specific fuels or technologies, and other incentives
or mandates designed to support transitioning to lower-emission energy sources. Political and other actors and their agents also
increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the availability or increase the cost
of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and
gas companies. Depending on how policies are formulated and applied, such policies could negatively affect our investment
returns, make our hydrocarbon-based products more expensive or less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and
reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon alternatives. Current and
pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering
emissions.
Technology and low carbon solutions. Achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve
net-zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources, as well as
technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS technologies, focused initially on capturing and sequestering CO2
emissions from high-intensity industrial activities, can assist in meeting society’s objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas
levels while also helping ensure the availability of the reliable and affordable energy the world requires. ExxonMobil has
established a Low Carbon Solutions (LCS) business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and
projects, including CCS, hydrogen and advanced biofuels, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving
materials, and other technologies. The company’s efforts include both in-house research and development and collaborative efforts
with leading universities as well as commercial partners involved in advanced lower-emission energy technologies. Our future
results and ability to grow our LCS business and succeed through the energy transition will depend in part on the success of these
research and collaboration efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the
energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner.
Policy and market development. The scale of the world’s energy system means that, in addition to developments in technology as
discussed above, a successful energy transition will require appropriate support from governments and private participants
throughout the global economy. Our ability to develop and deploy CCS and other lower emission energy technologies at
commercial scale, and the growth and future returns of LCS and other emerging businesses in which we invest, will depend in part
on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets. Failure or delay of these policies or markets to
materialize or be maintained could adversely impact these investments. Policy and other actions that result in restricting the
availability of hydrocarbon products without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects, including
increased commodity price volatility; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting inflationary pressures; and
local or regional energy shortages. Such effects in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy
by different actors, with resulting adverse effects on our businesses.

Item 1A.
Operational and Other Factors
In addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully
those factors that are at least in part within our control. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance
relative to competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more
co-venturers whom we do not control.
Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of
our exploration and development efforts. Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most
promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and
within budget.
Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses, as
well as the future success of LCS and other emerging lower-emission investments, depends on complex, long-term, capital
intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific
factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners,
governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs,
whether through long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage changes in operating conditions and
costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible, and
respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start-up or cause unscheduled project downtime; and
influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not perform that role. In addition to the effective
management of individual projects, ExxonMobil’s success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to
shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including diversification among types and
locations of our projects, products produced, and strategies to divest assets. We may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the
timeline we contemplate in our strategies. Additionally, we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held
liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated.
The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning
as in any government payment transparency reports.
Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, especially given the commodity-
based nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and improve
production yields on an ongoing basis. This requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of
high caliber employees.
Research and development and technological change. To maintain our competitive position, especially in light of the
technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil’s technology, research,
and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including
developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and
capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large
amounts of data to our businesses.
Safety, business controls, and environmental risk management. Our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the
inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential
for human error. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other
adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations
integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. Similarly,
we are implementing cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities. We employ a comprehensive enterprise risk
management system to identify and manage risk across our businesses. We also maintain a disciplined framework of internal
controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework. Substantial liabilities and other
adverse impacts could result if we do not timely identify and mitigate applicable risks, or if our management systems and controls
do not function as intended.
5
Cybersecurity. ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of sources including state-
sponsored actors. ExxonMobil’s defensive preparedness includes multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and
detection of cybersecurity disruptions; non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and
industry groups; internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on
resiliency including business response and recovery. If the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions
prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected, ExxonMobil as well as our customers, employees, or
third parties could be adversely affected. We are also exposed to potential harm from cybersecurity events that may affect the
operations of third-parties, including our partners, suppliers, service providers (including providers of cloud-hosting services for
our data or applications), and customers. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment;
damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost, or stolen; result in
employee, customer, or third-party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We could incur
significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting
regulatory actions, litigation, or reputational harm.
Preparedness. Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events. For
example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas.
Our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety
factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity,
marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and
earthquakes. Our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering
uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these
events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and
response, and business continuity planning.
Insurance limitations. The ability of the Corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this Item 1A is
limited by the availability and cost of coverage, which may not be economic, as well as the capacity of the applicable insurance
markets, which may not be sufficient.
Competition. As noted in Item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. We face competition not
only from other private firms, but also from state-owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of
their home countries and as partners with other private firms. In some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue opportunities
in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by
private shareholders, such as ExxonMobil. Technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the
competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of ExxonMobil or reduce the need for resource-
owning countries to partner with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources. As described in more
detail above, our hydrocarbon-based energy products are also subject to growing and, in many cases, government-supported
competition from alternative energy sources.
Reputation. Our reputation is an important corporate asset. Factors that could have a negative impact on our reputation include an
operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption; changes in consumer views concerning our products; a perception by
investors or others that the Corporation is making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to lead in the energy transition,
or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments with reduced returns; and other adverse events
such as those described in this Item 1A. Negative impacts on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for us to compete
successfully for new opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, obtain financing, attract talent, or could reduce consumer
demand for our branded products. ExxonMobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our

1. Disclosure of Reserves
A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-End 2021
The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated
subsidiaries and equity companies. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million
barrels. The Corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month
during the last 12-month period. As a result of higher average prices in 2021, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen, and natural
gas that did not qualify as proved reserves in the prior year qualified as proved reserves at year-end 2021. Otherwise, no major
discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2021 that would cause a significant change in the
estimated proved reserves as of that date.

In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the
Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated
subsidiaries.
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir
performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset
sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that
may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on
rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as
flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received
significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably
certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including
completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and
significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of
low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their
share of joint projects.
B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021
Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and
appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the
field to yield repeatable and consistent results.
Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and
performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including
high-quality 3‑D and 4‑D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data
included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.
In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to
increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.

C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves
ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the
operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance
with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the
reporting of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s
proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to
personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the
Global Reserves and Resources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a
degree in Engineering and served on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The group
is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including
expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold
degrees in either Engineering or Geology.
The Global Reserves and Resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates.
Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within
this central database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves
estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and
long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of
any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by
duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves
estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the
operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and
Resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made,
reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.
2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves
At year-end 2021, approximately 6.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as
proved undeveloped. This represents 34 percent of the 18.5 GOEB reported in proved reserves. This compares to 5.0 GOEB of
proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2020. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities that
resulted in the transfer of approximately 0.5 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end. The
largest transfers were related to development activities in the United States. During 2021, extensions and discoveries, primarily in
the United States, Brazil, and Guyana, resulted in an addition of approximately 1.3 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves, along
with an increase of approximately 0.6 GOEB due to revisions primarily in Asia and Canada.
Overall, investments of $8.0 billion were made by the Corporation during 2021 to progress the development of reported proved
undeveloped reserves, including $7.8 billion for oil and gas producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-
oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments
represented 65 percent of the $12.3 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.
One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments
toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long
lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved
undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped
reserves in Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates have remained undeveloped for five
years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development
for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and
amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance,
regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the
amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved
undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries.
In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Canada,
proved undeveloped reserves are related to Cold Lake operations. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the
remainder of the Tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz - Korolev field complex.
The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as
approved development phases progress. In the United Arab Emirates, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with an approved
development plan and continued drilling investment for the producing Upper Zakum field.

Average production prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor.
Average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and
natural gas liquids (NGL) production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3.A. The
volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in
section 3.A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas
Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial
Section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic
feet per one thousand barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas Resources Extracted by Mining Technologies
Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining
methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude
oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent
interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2021, the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about 62 thousand
barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to
extract the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada
Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100
percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in
the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands and
processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our
refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to
facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2021, average net production at Kearl was about 251 thousand barrels per day.
During 2021, approximately 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl were added to proved reserves primarily as a result of an
improved SEC price basis versus 2020.

ExxonMobil sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations, some of which
may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also enters into natural
gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and
the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 28 million barrels of oil and 2,500 billion
cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2022 through 2024. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments
with production from our proved developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled with production from our
proved undeveloped reserves and purchases on the open market as necessary.

20
ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks, and leases. The
terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production rights to the acreage are property-
specific, contractually defined, and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the
exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish
acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for
extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful
in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is
not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.
D. Summary of Acreage Terms
UNITED STATES
Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners
include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period
ranging from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases. Under certain
circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding
private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.
CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS
Canada
Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These
licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license
and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in
offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a
term of nine years. Offshore production licenses are valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production.
Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.
Argentina
The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in 2014. Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for an onshore
unconventional concession is 35 years, and 25 years for a conventional concession, with unlimited 10-year extensions possible,
once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years,
divided into two exploration periods of four years, with an optional extension of five years for each license. Two onshore
exploration concessions were initially granted prior to the amendment and are governed under Provincial Law with expiration
terms through 2024.
Brazil
The exploration and production of oil and gas are governed by concession contracts and production sharing contracts. Concession
contracts provide for an exploration period of up to 8 years and a production period of 27 years. Production sharing contracts
provide for an exploration period of up to 7 years and a production period of up to 28 years.
Guyana
The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act authorizes the government of Guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and
production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Petroleum
agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years and a production period of 20 years, with a 10-year extension.
EUROPE
Germany
Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions up to
three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20
to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license.
Netherlands
Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities
for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.
21
Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and
offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as
explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a
fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40
years.
United Kingdom
Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the
end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in
producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case
basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently
issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18
years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a
development plan at the end of the second term.
AFRICA
Angola
Exploration and production activities are governed by either production sharing agreements or other contracts with initial
exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from
20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.
Chad
Exploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and
conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30
years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.
Equatorial Guinea
Exploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry
of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.
Mozambique
Exploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the Government of the Republic of
Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. An interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was
acquired in 2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed by the Exploration and Production Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4
Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given
discovery area.
In 2018, an interest was acquired in offshore blocks, A5-B, Z5-C and Z5-D. Terms for the three blocks are governed by their
respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial
exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production
period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.
Nigeria
Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs)
with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil
Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a
10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL.
Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of
the 10-year exploration period, and OMLs have a 20-year production period that may be extended, subject to the partial
relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.
Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs
in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years, while in all other areas the licenses are for five years. Demonstrating a
commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.
22
OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were
for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed, effective December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20
years, with a further renewal option of 20 years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a joint venture
agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by
the Petroleum Profits Tax Act.
OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without
distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12-months written notice, for another period of 20 years.
OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first 10 years of their duration.
ASIA
Azerbaijan
The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field was established for an initial
period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by
25 years to 2049.
Indonesia
Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a
production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil
and gas activities. In 2012, Indonesia’s Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to BPMIGAS to be
unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions
and duties previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry of the Government of Indonesia until
the promulgation of a new oil and gas law. By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The
current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended once for a period of four years with a total contract
period of 30 years including an exploitation period. PSC terms can be extended for a maximum of 20 years for each extension with
the approval of the government.
Iraq
Development and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies
of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil
for the rights to participate in the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March
1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-
barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.
Kazakhstan
Onshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration license, and joint venture
agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that
commenced in 1993.
Offshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period
for each discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of
two 10-year extensions.
Malaysia
Production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have
production terms of 25 years. Extensions are generally subject to the national oil company’s prior written approval.
Qatar
The State of Qatar grants gas production development project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these
projects. The initial terms for these rights generally extend for 25 years. Extensions and terms are subject to State of Qatar
approval.
Russia
Terms for ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the current production sharing agreement between the Russian government
and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator.
23
Thailand
The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under ExxonMobil’s concessions for 30 years with a 10-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time. In 2021, one concession was extended to 2031.
United Arab Emirates
An interest in the development and production activities of the offshore Upper Zakum field was acquired in 2006. In 2017, the
governing agreements were extended to 2051.
AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA
Australia
Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation.
Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be
granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially viable
within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses
were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field.
Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely. In each case, a production license may be terminated if
no production operations have been carried on for five years.
Papua New Guinea
Exploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial
term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances).
Generally, a 50-percent relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six-year term, if extended. Petroleum
development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension for further consecutive period(s) of up to 20 years may
be granted at the Minister’s discretion. Petroleum retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially
viable at the time of application, but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years.
Petroleum retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice for the
maximum retention time of 15 years. Extensions of petroleum retention licenses may be for periods of less than one year,
renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less
than five years, provided that the total period of all extensions granted does not exceed 10 years.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS
Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions are
provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.
Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales
Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with
sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash both from operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of
assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that assets are contributing to the
Corporation’s strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably
more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated
with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business
and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Capital Employed
Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it
includes ExxonMobil’s net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and
long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes
ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity
companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.

Return on Average Capital Employed
Return on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments,
ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-
of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with
our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is net income attributable to
ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has
consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as one of the best measures of historical capital productivity
in our capital-intensive, long-term industry. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment
decisions.

Structural Cost Savings
Structural cost savings describe decreases in the below expenses as a result of operational efficiencies, workforce reductions and
other cost saving measures that are expected to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative
annual structural cost savings totaled $4.9 billion, of which $1.9 billion was achieved in 2021. The total change between periods in
expenses below will reflect both structural cost savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as energy costs,
inflation, and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations. Structural
cost savings are stewarded internally to support management’s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors
to understand the Corporation’s efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.

Earnings (Loss) excluding Identified Items
Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items, are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with an
absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item
for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several segments or several
periods. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating
and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors
increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes
of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income
(loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Risk Factors.
Energy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring
simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil
views any particular scenario as likely to occur. In addition, energy demand scenarios require assumptions on a variety of
parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty.
For example, the IEA describes its NZE scenario as extremely challenging, requiring unprecedented innovation, unprecedented
international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report
reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an
endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis
of ExxonMobil’s separate planning process, but may be secondarily tested for robustness or resiliency against different
assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not
constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.
OVERVIEW
The following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil’s financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and
related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil
Corporation. The Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration
for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including
carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical.
Where applicable ExxonMobil voluntarily discloses additional U.S., Non-U.S. and regional splits to help investors better
understand the company's operations.
In January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the
Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses – Upstream, Product Solutions, and
Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty
Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses
will be supported by a combined technology organization, and other centralized service-delivery groups, building on the
establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.
42
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
ExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-
positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies. The company’s integrated business model, with
significant investments in Upstream, Downstream and Chemical segments and Low Carbon Solutions business, generally reduces
the Corporation’s risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be
volatile on a short-term basis, ExxonMobil’s investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term
business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities. The
corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting operating and capital objectives in addition
to providing the economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the
corporate plan is the Energy Outlook and corporate plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles,
which are also updated at least annually. Price ranges for crude oil, natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical
margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange
rates are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are utilized for investment evaluation
purposes. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. Once major investments are
made, a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into future
projects.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Long-Term Business Outlook
ExxonMobil’s business planning is underpinned by a deep understanding of long-term energy fundamentals. These fundamentals
include energy supply and demand trends, the scale and variety of energy needs worldwide; capability, practicality and affordability
of energy alternatives including low-carbon solutions; greenhouse gas emission-reduction technologies; and supportive government
policies. The company’s Energy Outlook (Outlook) considers these fundamentals to form the basis for the company’s long-term
business planning, investment decisions, and research programs. The Outlook reflects the company’s view of global energy demand
and supply through 2050. It is a projection based on current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences,
geopolitics, and economic development. In addition, ExxonMobil considers a range of scenarios - including remote scenarios - to
help inform perspective of the future and enhance strategic thinking over time. Included in the range of these scenarios are the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Lower 2°C and the International Energy Agency's Net Zero Emissions (IEA NZE) by
2050 scenario. To effectively evaluate the pace of change, ExxonMobil uses many scenarios to help identify signposts that provide
leading indicators of future developments and allow for timely adjustments to the Outlook. The IEA describes the IEA NZE as
extremely challenging, requiring all stakeholders – governments, businesses, investors and citizens – to take action this year and
every year after so that the goal does not slip out of reach. The scenario assumes unprecedented and sustained energy efficiency
gains, innovation and technology transfer, lower-emission investments, and globally coordinated greenhouse gas reduction policy.
The IEA acknowledges that society is not on the IEA NZE pathway.
By 2050, the world’s population is projected at around 9.7 billion people, or about 2 billion more than in 2019. Coincident with this
population increase, the Corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average close to 2.5 percent per year, with economic
output growing by around 125 percent by 2050 compared to 2019. As economies and populations grow, and as living standards
improve for billions of people, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global
energy demand is projected to rise by almost 15 percent from 2019 to 2050. This increase in energy demand is expected to be
driven by developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD)).
As expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing use of energy-efficient technologies and practices as well
as lower-emission products will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions per unit of economic
output over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2050, affecting energy
requirements for power generation, transportation, industrial applications, and residential and commercial needs.
Under our Outlook, global electricity demand is expected to increase almost 75 percent from 2019 to 2050, with developing
countries likely to account for about 80 percent of the increase. Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to
remain the largest and fastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand, supported by a wide variety of energy
sources. The share of coal-fired generation is expected to decline substantially and approach 15 percent of the world’s electricity in
2050, versus nearly 35 percent in 2019, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas
emissions to address risks related to climate change. From 2019 to 2050, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas,
nuclear power, and renewables is expected to more than double, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and
offsetting the reduction of coal. Electricity from wind and solar is expected to increase more than 600 percent, helping total
renewables (including other sources, e.g. hydropower) to account for about 80 percent of the increase in electricity supplies
worldwide through 2050. Total renewables are expected to reach about 50 percent of global electricity supplies by 2050. Natural
gas and nuclear are also expected to increase shares over the period to 2050, reaching more than 25 percent and about 10 percent of
global electricity supplies, respectively, by 2050. Supplies of electricity by energy type will reflect significant differences across
regions reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and availability of various energy supplies and policy developments.
43
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Under our Outlook, energy for transportation - including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes - is expected to increase by almost
25 percent from 2019 to 2050. Transportation energy demand is expected to account for over 40 percent of the growth in liquid
fuels demand worldwide over this period. Light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak by around 2025 and then
decline to levels seen in the early-2000s by 2050 as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by
China, Europe, and the United States, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of about 75 percent. By 2050, light-duty
vehicles are expected to account for around 15 percent of global liquid fuels demand. During the same time period, nearly all the
world’s commercial transportation fleets are expected to continue to run on liquid fuels, including biofuels, which are widely
available and offer practical advantages in providing a large quantity of energy in small volumes.
Liquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting broad-based availability, affordability, ease of
transportation, and fitness as a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. By 2050, global demand for liquid fuels is
projected to grow to approximately 114 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of about 14 percent from 2019. The
non-OECD share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to nearly 70 percent by 2050, as liquid fuels demand in the
OECD is expected to decline by more than 20 percent. Much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production
from traditional conventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to
offset much of the natural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources - including tight oil,
deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels - are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. The world’s resource base
is sufficient to meet projected demand through 2050 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic and
lower-carbon supply options. However, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable
supplies.
Natural gas is a lower-emission, versatile and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications, and it is expected to grow the most of
any primary energy type from 2019 to 2050, meeting about 55 percent of global energy demand growth. Global natural gas demand
is expected to rise nearly 35 percent from 2019 to 2050, with more than half of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region.
Significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas - the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations - will help
meet these needs. In total, about 50 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. At
the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply, meeting more than two-
thirds of worldwide demand in 2050. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade will expand significantly, meeting about 40 percent of the
increase in global demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.
The world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2050. Oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy
with its share remaining close to 30 percent in 2050. Coal is currently the second largest source of energy, but it is expected to lose
that position to natural gas in the next few years. The share of natural gas is expected to reach more than 25 percent by 2050, while
the share of coal falls to about half that of natural gas. Nuclear power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations are likely
to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues. Total renewable
energy is expected to exceed 20 percent of global energy by 2050, with biomass, hydro and geothermal contributing a combined
share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing over
420 percent from 2019 to 2050, when they are projected to be about 10 percent of the world energy mix.
To meet this projected demand under our Outlook, the Corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base
will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from increases in previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these
increases. The investments to develop and supply resources to meet global demand through 2050 will be significant. This reflects a
fundamental aspect of the oil and natural gas business as the International Energy Agency (IEA) describes in its World Energy
Outlook 2021.
International accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with
uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has taken into
account policies established to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Energy Outlook. The climate
accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging.
Our Energy Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the global
aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as available at the end of 2020, which were submitted by signatories
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Energy Outlook seeks to
identify potential impacts of climate-related policies, which often target specific sectors. It estimates potential impacts of these
policies on consumer energy demand by using various assumptions and tools - including, depending on the sector, and, as
applicable, use of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies (e.g. automotive fuel economy standards). For purposes
of the Energy Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO2 emissions is assumed to reach about $100 per metric ton in 2050 in
OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people
and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need practical solutions that do not
jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need. The Corporation continues to monitor the updates to the NDCs
that nations provided around COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021 as well as other policy developments in light of net-zero
ambitions recently formulated by some nations.
44
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The information provided in the Outlook includes ExxonMobil’s internal estimates and projections based upon internal data and
analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources including the International Energy Agency.
Leading the Drive to Net Zero
The company plans to play a leading role in the energy transition by leveraging its core capabilities to meet society’s needs for
products essential for modern life, while addressing the challenge of climate change.
The Corporation announced its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions from its operated assets by 2050 (Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse
gas emissions) and is taking a comprehensive approach centered on developing detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for major
operated assets. The company’s roadmap approach identifies greenhouse gas emission-reduction opportunities and the investment
and future policy needs required to achieve net-zero. The roadmaps are tailored to account for facility configuration and
maintenance schedules, and they will be updated as technologies and policies evolve. Net-zero roadmaps for major assets, covering
about 90% of the company’s greenhouse gas emissions, are scheduled to be completed by year-end 2022, and the remainder in
2023.
Our strategy uses our advantages in scale, integration, technology and people to build globally competitive businesses that lead
industry in earnings and cash flow growth across a broad range of scenarios. The company’s plans to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions through 2030 compared to 2016 levels support its net-zero ambition. The plans are expected to result in a 20-30%
reduction in corporate-wide greenhouse gas intensity, including reductions of 40-50% in upstream intensity, 70-80% in methane
intensity and 60-70% in flaring intensity. These plans include actions that are expected to reduce absolute corporate-wide
greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 20%, including an estimated 70% reduction in methane emissions, 60% reduction in
flaring emissions and 30% reduction in upstream emissions.
ExxonMobil established its Low Carbon Solutions business in early 2021, leveraging its unique combination of capabilities such as
geophysics expertise and complex project management, to establish a new business in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and
biofuels to accelerate emission reductions for customers and in its existing businesses.
The Corporation plans to invest in initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions. A significant focus is on scaling up carbon capture
and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. Stronger policy further accelerates development and deployment of lower-emission
technologies, and would provide ExxonMobil additional investment opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The
company's robust research and development process, continued evaluation of emerging technologies, and global collaborations will
be key to identifying and growing lower-emission opportunities. During the start-up phase, the Low Carbon Solutions business will
be reflected in Corporate and Financing.
Recent Business Environment
In early 2020, the balance of supply and demand for petroleum and petrochemical products experienced two significant disruptive
effects. On the demand side, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of the world resulting in substantial
reductions in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.
This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain key oil-producing countries which led
to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.
Demand for petroleum and petrochemical products has continued to recover through 2021, with the Corporation's financial results
benefiting from stronger prices and margins, notably prices for crude oil and natural gas as well as Chemical product margins. The
rate and pace of recovery, however, has varied across geographies and business lines, with Downstream margins only reaching the
lower end of the 10-year range late in 2021 and jet demand continuing to lag. The Corporation continues to closely monitor
industry and economic conditions amid this uneven global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic which has brought
unprecedented uncertainties to near-term economic outlooks.
The general rate of inflation across major countries of operation experienced a brief decline in the initial stage of the COVID-19
pandemic. However inflation rates increased in 2021 across major economies, with some regions experiencing multi-decade highs,
largely reflecting overall imbalances between supply and demand recoveries from the pandemic. The underlying factors include,
but are not limited to, global supply chain disruptions, shipping bottlenecks, labor market constraints, and side effects from
monetary and fiscal expansions. The global economic recovery remains uneven, with uncertainties remaining. Prices for services
and materials continue to evolve in response to fast-changing commodity markets, industry activities, as well as government
policies, impacting operating and capital costs. The Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate cost impacts
in all price environments through its economies of scale in global procurement, efficient project management practices, and general
productivity improvements.
Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to realize nearly $5 billion of structural
cost savings versus 2019, leveraging increased operational efficiencies and reduced overhead costs. Included in these savings is the
completion of the workforce reduction programs, announced in late 2020 and early 2021, which are estimated to generate savings
of approximately $2 billion per year compared to 2019 from lower employee and contractor costs. The company continues to take
actions to streamline its business structure to improve effectiveness and reduce costs. The changes more fully leverage global
functional capabilities, improve line of sight to markets, and enhance resource allocation to the highest corporate priorities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
BUSINESS RESULTS
Upstream
ExxonMobil continues to sustain a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which enables the
Corporation to be selective, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil’s fundamental
strategies guide our global Upstream business, including capturing material and accretive opportunities to continually high-grade
the resource portfolio, selectively developing attractive oil and natural gas resources, developing and applying high-impact
technologies, and pursuing productivity and efficiency gains as well as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. These strategies
are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the communities
within which we operate.
As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the
geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on current investment plans, the
proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. About half
of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater and LNG resources. This proportion is generally
expected to grow over the next few years.
The Upstream capital program continues to prioritize low cost-of-supply opportunities. In addition to continued development of
Guyana, Brazil, and the Permian Basin, ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects. Most notable are our LNG
developments in Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the Golden Pass LNG facility.
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir
performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset
sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that
may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side
largely being a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, levels of prosperity, technology advances,
consumer preference and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the
actions of OPEC and other large government resource owners, and other factors. To manage the risks associated with price,
ExxonMobil tests the resiliency of its annual plans and major investments across a range of price scenarios.
Key Recent Events
Significant progress was made on key new developments in Guyana, Brazil, the Permian Basin, and Mozambique during 2021.
Guyana: Exploration success continued with additional discoveries increasing the estimated recoverable resource on the Stabroek
block. The Liza Unity floating production, storage and offloading vessel arrived in Guyanese waters in late 2021 and started
production in February 2022. In Payara, the third project, development drilling activities started in late 2021 and it remains on
schedule for 2024 start-up. Yellowtail is the fourth and largest world-class development project and is expected to achieve first oil
in 2025, following issuance of the production license.
Permian: Production volumes averaged about 460 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2021, nearly 100 koebd year-
on-year production increase which exceeded expectations. The Corporation was successful in increasing drilling performance and
continuing to improve capital efficiency. In December, ExxonMobil announced plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions
(Scope 1 and 2) by 2030 from our unconventional operations in the Permian Basin.
Brazil: ExxonMobil announced its Final Investment Decision for the Bacalhau Phase 1 development in June 2021 with start-up
planned for 2024.
Mozambique: The Area 4 Coral South Floating LNG (FLNG) development continues as planned, targeting start-up in 2022,
making Mozambique an LNG exporter. The Coral Sul FLNG vessel began tow to field in November 2021.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to
volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon
achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result
of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent
events, such as lower crude oil prices. 
Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes
to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability
can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels
are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or
market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements. 
Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels due to temporary non-operational production
limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.
Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in
a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. 
Demand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions
that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from
project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural
field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Downstream
ExxonMobil’s Downstream continues to be one of the largest, most integrated businesses among international oil companies (IOC),
with significant positions across the full value chain including logistics, trading, refining, and marketing. The Corporation has a
well-established presence in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
Downstream strategies competitively position the business across a range of market conditions. These strategies focus on providing
high-value and lower-emission products that customers need to power global mobility; leveraging strong operations performance;
capitalizing on integration across all ExxonMobil businesses; maximizing value from advantaged technology and a robust pipeline
of lower-emission opportunities; and improving portfolio competitiveness and resilience with advantaged investments and
divestments.
With its large manufacturing footprint, ExxonMobil’s Downstream earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins. Refining
margins improved steadily throughout 2021, recovering from historic lows in 2020 driven by COVID-19 pandemic demand
impacts. By the end of 2021, refining margins had recovered to the bottom of the 10-year historical band from 2010 to 2019.
Demand for gasoline and diesel had essentially recovered to normal levels by the end of 2021, while jet fuel demand remained
below historical levels reflecting continued COVID-19 restrictions. Refining margins are anticipated to further improve in the near
term as the recovery in international travel increases demand for jet fuel, and strong chemical demand persists for products essential
to modern life. With improving market conditions, we restarted projects in Beaumont, Texas and Singapore to further strengthen the
portfolio by increasing production of high-value fuels and lubricants.
Refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery
pays for its raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced. Crude oil and many products are widely traded
with published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g. New York Mercantile Exchange and
Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many
factors, including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import/export
balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather, and political climate. ExxonMobil’s outlook is that industry refining
margins will remain volatile subject to shifting consumer demand as well as capacity changes from refinery additions and closures.
ExxonMobil’s significant integration both within the Downstream value chains including lubricants, logistics, trading, refining, and
marketing, as well as with Upstream and Chemical, improves our ability to generate shareholder value in a variety of market
conditions.
ExxonMobil continues to grow fuels product sales in new markets near major production assets with continued progress in the
Mexico and Indonesia markets. Similarly, the lubricants business continues to grow, especially in Asia Pacific and the industrial
sector, leveraging world class brands and integration with basestocks refining capability. Through the Mobil brands, such as Mobil
1, ExxonMobil is the worldwide leader in synthetic motor oils.
The Downstream business is characterized by periods of margin volatility resulting from short-term and long-term supply and
demand fluctuations. Proposed carbon policy and other climate-related regulations in many countries have the potential to increase
industry volatility, both favorably and unfavorably. ExxonMobil continually evaluates the Downstream portfolio during all phases
of the business cycle, which has resulted in numerous asset divestments and terminal conversions over the past decade to strengthen
overall profitability and resiliency. When investing in the Downstream, ExxonMobil remains focused on projects resilient across a
broad range of market conditions to support capturing value when opportunities emerge.
Key Recent Events
Lower-emission fuels: ExxonMobil announced plans for more than 40 thousand barrels per day of lower-emission fuels by 2025,
including a new renewable diesel unit at the Strathcona refinery, and purchase agreements with Global Clean Energy in the U.S.
and Biojet AS in Norway.
Terminal conversions: ExxonMobil converted the Slagen, Norway and Altona, Australia refineries into product import terminals
capable of serving existing markets. Additionally, Refining New Zealand announced conversion of its refinery (in which
ExxonMobil owns a 17% minority share) to a product import terminal in 2022.

Chemical
ExxonMobil is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals that support modern living. ExxonMobil helps meet
society’s evolving needs by providing a wide range of innovative, valuable product solutions in an efficient and responsible
manner. This is enabled by ExxonMobil’s proprietary technology combined with industry-leading scale and integration. These
competitive advantages are underpinned by operational excellence, advantaged investments, and cost discipline.
In 2021, while many markets continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, demand for chemical products remained resilient
in several key segments including food packaging, hygiene and medical. Overall chemical industry margins improved compared to
2020 due to continued strong packaging demand and industry supply disruptions. We were uniquely positioned to capture value
from the market in 2021 due to our integration, enabling nimble feed and product optimization, and our advantaged global supply
and logistics. These, along with our outstanding reliability performance and continued structural cost savings, delivered record
annual earnings.
Worldwide demand for chemicals is expected to grow faster than the economy as a whole, driven by global population growth, an
expanding middle class, and improving living standards. ExxonMobil’s integration with refining, together with our high-value
performance products and unique project execution capability, enhances our ability to generate returns on investments across a
range of market environments. In 2021, ExxonMobil completed construction of our joint venture ethane cracker and associated
derivative units near Corpus Christi, Texas. The project started up in late 2021 below budget and ahead of schedule. With
improving market conditions, we also restarted other U.S. Gulf Coast growth projects, including projects in Baytown, Texas and
Baton Rouge, Louisiana that will support the growing demand for high-value chemicals products.
Key Recent Events
China investment: ExxonMobil reached final investment decision to proceed with a multi-billion dollar chemical complex in the
Dayawan Petrochemical Industrial Park in Huizhou, Guangdong Province in China. The facility will help meet expected demand
growth for performance chemical products in China.
Advanced recycling: The Corporation is progressing construction of one of North America’s largest plastic waste advanced
recycling facilities in Baytown, Texas, which is expected to start operations in 2022. In addition, plans are underway for up to
500,000 metric tons annually of advanced recycling capacity to be added across multiple sites by 2026. These investments enabled
commercial volumes of certified circular polymers to be made available to the market in 2021.
Materia acquisition: ExxonMobil acquired Materia, Inc., a technology company that has pioneered the development of a Nobel
prize-winning technology for manufacturing a new class of materials. The innovative materials can be used in a number of
applications, including wind turbine blades, electric vehicle parts, sustainable construction, and anticorrosive coatings.
Santoprene divestment: ExxonMobil Chemical Company sold its global Santoprene business to Celanese. The sale included two
manufacturing sites, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom.

Total cash and cash equivalents were $6.8 billion at the end of 2021, up $2.4 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds
in 2021 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $23.6 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6
billion for depreciation and depletion, contributions from operational working capital of $4.2 billion, proceeds from asset sales of
$3.2 billion, and other investing activities of $1.5 billion. The major uses of funds included a debt reduction of $19.7 billion,
spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $12.1 billion, dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion, and additional
investments and advances of $2.8 billion.
Total cash and cash equivalents were $4.4 billion at the end of 2020, up $1.3 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds
in 2020 were the adjustment for the noncash provision of $46.0 billion, a net debt increase of $20.1 billion, proceeds from asset
sales of $1.0 billion, and other investing activities of $2.7 billion. The major uses of funds included a net loss including
noncontrolling interests of $23.3 billion, spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $17.3 billion, dividends to
shareholders of $14.9 billion, and additional investments and advances of $4.9 billion.
The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. In addition to cash balances, commercial
paper continues to provide short-term liquidity, and is reflected in “Notes and loans payable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
with changes in outstanding commercial paper between periods included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The
Corporation took steps to strengthen its balance sheet in 2021, reducing debt by nearly $20 billion and ending the year with $47.7
billion in total debt. On December 31, 2021, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $10.7 billion and
undrawn long-term lines of credit of $0.6 billion.
To support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and
continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase
production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates
for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but
not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the
Corporation’s key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation’s
net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.
The Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in
quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years
providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual
project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes;
the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; and changes in
the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment. The Corporation’s cash flows
are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more complete discussion
of risks.
The Corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. Capital and exploration expenditures
in 2021 were $16.6 billion, reflecting the Corporation’s continued active investment program. The Corporation plans to invest in
the range of $21 billion to $24 billion in 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. The Corporation has a large
and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical
risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of
opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the
Corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments.
The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.
Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either
gains or losses. In light of commodity price volatility, and depending on the pace of demand recovery, the Corporation's planned
divestment program could be adversely affected by fewer financially suitable buyers. This could result in a slowing of the pace of
divestments, certain assets being sold at a price below current book value, or impairment charges if the likelihood of divesting
certain assets increases. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through
acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions
include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
Corporation’s common stock, or both.
ExxonMobil closely monitors the potential impact of Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) reform, including LIBOR, under a number of
scenarios and has taken steps to mitigate the potential impact. Accordingly, ExxonMobil does not believe this event represents a
material risk to the Corporation’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
 
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
 
2021
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $48.1 billion in 2021, $33.5 billion higher than 2020. The major source of funds was
net income including noncontrolling interests of $23.6 billion, an increase of $46.8 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation
and depletion was $20.6 billion, down $25.4 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for the net gain on asset sales was $1.2
billion, an increase of $1.2 billion. The adjustment for dividends received less than equity in current earnings of equity companies
was a reduction of $0.7 billion, compared to an increase of $1.0 billion in 2020. Changes in operational working capital, excluding
cash and debt, increased cash in 2021 by $4.2 billion.
 
2020
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $14.7 billion in 2020, $15.0 billion lower than 2019. Net income (loss) including
noncontrolling interests was a loss of $23.3 billion, a decrease of $38.0 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and
depletion was $46.0 billion, up $27.0 billion from the prior year, mainly due to asset impairments. The noncash provision for
deferred income tax benefits was $8.9 billion and also included impacts from asset impairments. The adjustment for the net loss on
asset sales was $4 million, a decrease of $1.7 billion. The adjustment for dividends received less than equity in current earnings of
equity companies was an increase of $1.0 billion, compared to a reduction of $0.9 billion in 2019. Changes in operational working
capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash in 2020 by $1.7 billion.
 
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
 
2021
Cash used in investing activities netted to $10.2 billion in 2021, $8.2 billion lower than 2020. Spending for property, plant and
equipment of $12.1 billion decreased $5.2 billion from 2020. Proceeds from asset sales and returns of investments of $3.2 billion
compared to $1.0 billion in 2020. Additional investments and advances were $2.0 billion lower in 2021, while proceeds from other
investing activities including collection of advances decreased by $1.2 billion.
 
2020
Cash used in investing activities netted to $18.5 billion in 2020, $4.6 billion lower than 2019. Spending for property, plant and
equipment of $17.3 billion decreased $7.1 billion from 2019. Proceeds from asset sales and returns of investments of $1.0 billion
compared to $3.7 billion in 2019. Additional investments and advances were $1.0 billion higher in 2020, while proceeds from other
investing activities including collection of advances increased by $1.2 billion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
 
2021
Cash used in financing activities was $35.4 billion in 2021, $40.7 billion higher than 2020. Dividend payments on common shares
increased to $3.49 per share from $3.48 per share and totaled $14.9 billion. During 2021, the Corporation utilized cash to reduce
debt by $19.7 billion.
ExxonMobil share of equity increased $11.4 billion to $168.6 billion. The addition to equity for earnings was $23.0 billion. This
was offset by reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $14.9 billion, all in the form of dividends. Foreign
exchange translation effects of $0.9 billion for the stronger U.S. dollar reduced equity and a $3.8 billion change in the funded status
of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity.
During 2021, Exxon Mobil Corporation suspended its share repurchase program used to offset shares or units settled in shares
issued in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. In 2022, the Corporation initiated a share repurchase
program of up to $10 billion over 12 to 24 months.
 
2020
Cash flow from financing activities was $5.3 billion in 2020, $11.9 billion higher than 2019. Dividend payments on common shares
increased to $3.48 per share from $3.43 per share and totaled $14.9 billion. During 2020, the Corporation issued $23.2 billion of
long-term debt. Total debt increased $20.7 billion to $67.6 billion at year-end.
ExxonMobil share of equity decreased $34.5 billion to $157.2 billion. The reduction to equity for losses was $22.4 billion and the
reduction for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $14.9 billion, all in the form of dividends. Foreign exchange translation
effects of $1.8 billion for the weaker U.S. dollar and a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits
reserves increased equity.
During 2020, Exxon Mobil Corporation acquired 8 million shares of its common stock for the treasury. Purchases were made to
offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding
decreased from 4,234 million to 4,233 million at the end of 2020.
Contractual Obligations
The Corporation has contractual obligations involving commitments to third parties that impact its liquidity and capital resource
needs. These contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt, asset retirement obligations, pension and other postretirement
benefits, take-or-pay and unconditional purchase obligations, and firm capital commitments. See Notes 9, 11, 14 and 17 for
information related to asset retirement obligations, leases, long-term debt and pensions, respectively.
In addition, the Corporation also enters into commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum
price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales
contracts with similar pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and
commitments to purchase refinery products at market prices. These commitments are not meaningful in assessing liquidity and cash
flow, because the purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions.
Take-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase obligations are
those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to
secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services. These obligations mainly pertain to pipeline,
manufacturing supply and terminal agreements. The total obligation at year-end 2021 for take-or-pay and unconditional purchase
obligations was $30,031 million. Cash payments expected in 2022 and 2023 are $4,004 million and $3,560 million, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Guarantees
The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2021 for guarantees relating
to notes, loans and performance under contracts (Note 16). Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar
matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These
guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
 
Financial Strength
On December 31, 2021, the Corporation had total unused short-term committed lines of credit of $10.7 billion (Note 6) and total
unused long-term committed lines of credit of $0.6 billion (Note 14). The table below shows the Corporation’s consolidated debt to
capital ratios.
 
 2021 2020 2019
Debt to capital (percent) 21.4 29.2 19.1
Net debt to capital (percent) 18.9 27.8 18.1
 
Management views the Corporation’s financial strength to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. The Corporation’s
financial position gives it the opportunity to access the world’s capital markets across a range of market conditions, and enables the
Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.
Industry conditions in 2020 led to lower realized prices for the Corporation’s products which resulted in substantially lower
earnings and operating cash flow in comparison to 2019. The Corporation took steps to strengthen its liquidity in 2020, including
issuing $23.2 billion of long-term debt and implementing significant capital and operating cost reductions. The Corporation ended
2020 with $67.6 billion in total debt.
Stronger prices and margins improved the Corporation's financial results in 2021. The Corporation reduced debt by $19.9 billion
and ended the year with $47.7 billion in total debt.
 
Litigation and Other Contingencies
As discussed in Note 16, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a
number of pending lawsuits. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the
ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already
included in reported financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating results or financial condition.
Refer to Note 16 for additional information on legal proceedings and other contingencies.
CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES
Capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) represents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment,
and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Consolidated Statement of Income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share
of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares
used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and
equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income,
particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Capex in 2021 was $16.6 billion, as the Corporation continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy. The Corporation plans to invest in the range of $21 billion to $24 billion in 2022.
Included in the 2022 capital spend range is $8.3 billion of firm capital commitments. An additional $10.7 billion of firm capital
commitments have been made for years 2023 and beyond. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual
projects and property acquisitions.
Upstream spending of $12.3 billion in 2021 was down 15 percent from 2020, primarily in the U.S. Permian Basin. Investments in
2021 included the U.S. Permian Basin and key development projects in Guyana and Brazil. Development projects typically take
several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large
and complex projects. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 66 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2021, and
has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.
Capital investments in the Downstream totaled $2.1 billion in 2021, a decrease of $2.1 billion from 2020, reflecting lower global
project spending. Chemical capital expenditures of $2.2 billion, decreased $0.5 billion, representing reduced spend on growth
projects.

Total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement were $40.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $17.8 billion from 2020. Income tax
expense, both current and deferred, was $7.6 billion compared to a $5.6 billion benefit in 2020. The effective tax rate, which is
calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 31 percent
compared to 17 percent in the prior year due primarily to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates. Total
other taxes and duties of $33.0 billion in 2021 increased $4.5 billion.
 
2020
Total taxes on the Corporation’s income statement were $22.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of $15.7 billion from 2019. Income tax
expense, both current and deferred, was a benefit of $5.6 billion compared to $5.3 billion expense in 2019. The relative benefit was
driven by asset impairments recorded in 2020. The effective tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income
taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 17 percent compared to 34 percent in the prior year due
primarily to a change in mix of results in jurisdictions with varying tax rates. Total other taxes and duties of $28.4 billion in 2020
decreased $4.8 billion.

 (millions of dollars)
Capital expenditures 1,202 1,087 
Other expenditures 3,361 3,389 
Total 4,563 4,476 
 
Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations
on air, water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean
fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2021
worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity
company expenditures, were $4.6 billion, of which $3.4 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital
expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $5.3 billion in 2022, with capital
expenditures expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total. Costs for 2023 are anticipated to be higher as the Low
Carbon Solutions business matures and the Corporation progresses its emission-reduction plans.
Environmental Liabilities
The Corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued
liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the potentially responsible parties. The involvement of
other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate ExxonMobil’s actual joint and several liability
exposure. At present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to ExxonMobil’s operations or financial condition.
Consolidated company provisions made in 2021 for environmental liabilities were $146 million ($263 million in 2020) and the
balance sheet reflects liabilities of $807 million as of December 31, 2021, and $902 million as of December 31, 2020.
MARKET RISKS
Worldwide Average Realizations (1) 2021 2020 2019
Crude oil and NGL ($ per barrel) 61.89 35.41 56.32 
Natural gas ($ per thousand cubic feet) 4.33 2.01 3.05 
(1) Consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces. The impacts
of these price fluctuations on earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. For the year 2022, a
$1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $500 million annual after-tax effect
on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic
feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $155 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream
consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit
or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other
government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly,
changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in
any particular period.
In the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than
absolute price levels of products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw
materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances and weather.
The global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the
Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times
associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position. Management views the
Corporation’s financial strength as a competitive advantage.
61
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where
such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated refinery and chemical complexes.
Additionally, intersegment sales are at market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired
in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity, and transportation capabilities. Refer to Note 18 for additional
information on intersegment revenue.
Although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global
economic conditions, political events, decisions by OPEC and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry
economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. Accordingly, the Corporation evaluates the
viability of its major investments over a range of prices.
The Corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels
or considered for divestment. The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure that assets are
contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives.
Risk Management
The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream
and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and
interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk
and to generate returns from trading. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At
times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s
financial position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, or results of operations for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019. Credit risk
associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing
exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. No material market or credit risks to the
Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity exist as a result of the derivatives described in Note 13. The
Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
The Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that
carries floating interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be
material to earnings or cash flow. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt
as required. Commercial paper is used to balance short-term liquidity requirements. Some joint-venture partners are dependent on
the credit markets, and their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.
The Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales,
expenses, financing and investment transactions. Fluctuations in exchange rates are often offsetting and the impacts on
ExxonMobil’s geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied. The Corporation makes limited use of currency
exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and exposures related to the Corporation’s use of these
contracts are not material.
62
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and
production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products,
petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon
capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting policies are
summarized in Note 1.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations,
commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines,
development and production costs, and other factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through
long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level
geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group which has significant technical
experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific
quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of
Reserves in Item 2.
Oil and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves.
•Proved oil and natural gas reserves are determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
requirements. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering
data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating
conditions and government regulations. Proved reserves are determined using the average of first-of-month oil and natural
gas prices during the reporting year.
Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves include
amounts which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved
undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves are recognized
only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless
specific circumstances support a longer period of time.
The Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced. However, the timing and amount recovered can
be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory
approvals, government policy, consumer preferences and significant changes in oil and natural gas price levels.
•Unproved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include
probable reserves. Probable reserves are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
Revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of
(1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the
average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result
from significant changes in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity.
Unit-of-Production Depreciation
Oil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream
assets. Depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved developed reserves applied to
actual production. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to
some variability.
In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an
upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the
asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil
and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset
is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.
To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the
resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated
using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful
quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.
63
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Impairment
The Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for
indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC
360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle.
Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these
assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, and development and
production costs. Significant reductions in the Corporation’s view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges,
especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce, or
eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances,
including indicators outlined in ASC 360, can be indicators of potential impairment as well.
In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes
that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices
will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand
fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to
generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology, and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment
activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general
economic activities, alternative energy sources and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation
expects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will
experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating
losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.
Energy Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the
mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for
the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the Energy Outlook, which contains the Corporation’s demand and supply
projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and
economic development. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not project the degree of
required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net-zero by 2050. As
future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Energy Outlook, and the Corporation’s
business plans will be updated accordingly.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates
the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Cash flows used in
recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the
Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations
make use of the Corporation’s assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price
differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices,
and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales.
Management’s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and
may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. The greenhouse gas emission prices reflect existing or anticipated policy
actions that countries or localities may take in support of Paris Accord pledges. While third-party scenarios, such as the
International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions by 2050, may be used to test the resiliency of the Corporation's businesses or
strategies, they are not used as a basis for developing future cash flows for impairment assessments.
Fair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group’s
carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair
value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates
of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash
flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future
production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party
industry experts and government agencies, refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs and
discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Other Impairment Estimates. Unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired.
Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are
recorded based on the Corporation's future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time
that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and
amortized based on development risk and average holding period.
Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its
fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and
adjusted to the lower value. Judgment is required to determine if assets are held for sale and to determine the fair value less cost to
sell.
Investments in equity companies are assessed for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses, negative
earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects
for the investee’s business segment or geographic region. If the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary, the
carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. In the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash
flows are used to assess fair value, which requires significant judgment.
Recent Impairments. In 2021, the Corporation identified situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that the
carrying value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable and performed impairment assessments. After-tax impairment
charges of $1.0 billion, including impairments of suspended wells, were recognized during the year largely as a result of changes to
Upstream development plans.
In 2020, as part of the Corporation's annual review and approval of its business and strategic plan, a decision was made to no longer
develop a significant portion of the dry gas portfolio in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. The impairment of these assets resulted in
after-tax charges of $18.4 billion in Upstream. Other after-tax impairment charges of $1.1 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.2 billion were
recognized in Upstream, Downstream and Chemical, respectively. These charges include impairments of property, plant and
equipment, goodwill and equity method investments.
In 2019, after-tax impairment charges were $0.2 billion.
Factors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include reductions in the Corporation’s price or margin
outlooks, changes in the allocation of capital or development plans, reduced long-term demand for the Corporation's products, and
operating cost increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural gas price or margin increases. However,
due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices or margins, and the relationship between industry prices and
costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges related to the
Corporation’s long-lived assets.
For further information regarding impairments in goodwill, equity method investments, property, plant and equipment and
suspended wells, refer to Notes 3, 7, 9 and 10, respectively.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Corporation is subject to retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities
on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses
assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical
assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement
obligations are disclosed in Note 9.
Suspended Exploratory Well Costs
The Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when it has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify
completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Assessing whether the
Corporation is making sufficient progress on a project requires careful consideration of the facts and circumstances. The facts and
circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end are disclosed in Note 10.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Pension Benefits
The Corporation and its affiliates sponsor about 80 defined benefit (pension) plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefits footnote (Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.
Some of these plans (primarily non-U.S.) provide pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of
corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage
advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is
expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is
expensed over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for
unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on
fund assets.
For funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance
arrangements. These plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meet or exceed
required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement dates. In
determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those
used for accounting purposes.
The Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations,
regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the
respective sponsoring affiliate.
Pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the
discount rate for the benefit obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases. Pension assumptions are reviewed
annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market
rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2021 was 5.3 percent. The 10-year and 20-
year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the long-
term expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking
into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is
then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset
class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by
approximately $190 million before tax.
Differences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the
year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into
pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.
Litigation and Tax Contingencies
A variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending
lawsuits. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss.
Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.
Management judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict.
However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect
on operations or financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards
are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.
The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. The benefits of uncertain tax positions that
the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management
concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be
sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely
of being realized. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes
because the outcomes are often difficult to predict. The Corporation’s unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years
are summarized in Note 19.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Corporation”)
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in
equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Corporation's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the
Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
The Impact of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
As described in Notes 1, 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation’s consolidated upstream property, plant
and equipment (PP&E), net balance was $157.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, and the related depreciation and depletion
expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $16.7 billion. Management uses the successful efforts method to account for its
exploration and production activities. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether unproved or
proved) are capitalized when incurred. As disclosed by management, proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the
basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. The estimation of proved oil and natural gas
reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of
well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, development and production costs, among other factors. As
further disclosed by management, reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level
geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group (together “management’s
specialists”).
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and natural gas
reserves on upstream PP&E, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of
management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes, as the reserve volumes are
based on engineering assumptions and methods, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort
in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its
specialists in developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes and the assumptions applied to the data related
to future development costs and production costs, as applicable.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management's estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management's specialists was used in
performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for using
this work, the specialists' qualifications were understood and the Corporation's relationship with the specialists was assessed. The
procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the
specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists' findings. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness
and accuracy of the data related to future development costs and production costs. Additionally, these procedures included
evaluating whether the assumptions applied to the data related to future development costs and production costs were reasonable
considering the past performance of the Corporation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility of the
management of Exxon Mobil Corporation.
The Corporation’s principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade,
transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit
of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Prior years’ data have been reclassified in certain
cases to conform to the 2021 presentation basis.
1. Summary of Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Accounting for Investments
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the Corporation controls. They also include the
Corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing
the Corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in
“Investments, advances and long-term receivables”. The Corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in
the Consolidated Statement of Income caption “Income from equity affiliates”.
Majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain
factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. These factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive
participating rights. These include the right to approve operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and
management compensation and succession plans.
Investments in equity companies are assessed for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses, negative
earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects
for the investee’s business segment or geographic region. If the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary, the
carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. In the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash
flows are used to assess fair value.
Investments in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investments are measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Corporation uses the modified approach for equity securities that do not have a
readily determinable fair value. This modified approach measures investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions in a similar investment of the same issuer.
The Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income”.
Revenue Recognition
The Corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at
prevailing market prices. In some cases (e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic price
adjustments to reflect market conditions. Revenue is recognized at the amount the Corporation expects to receive when the
customer has taken control, which is typically when title transfers and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of
ownership. The prices of certain sales are based on price indices that are sometimes not available until the next period. In such
cases, estimated realizations are accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is available. Such
adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods are not significant. Payment for revenue
transactions is typically due within 30 days. Future volume delivery obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are
expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchases. These performance obligations are based on market prices at the
time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to market price volatility.
Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and
recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold.
“Sales and other operating revenue” and “Notes and accounts receivable” primarily arise from contracts with customers. Long-term
receivables are primarily from non-customers. Contract assets are mainly from marketing assistance programs and are not
significant. Contract liabilities are mainly customer prepayments and accruals of expected volume discounts and are not significant.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Income and Other Taxes
The Corporation excludes from the Consolidated Statement of Income certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and
concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes,
for which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both
“Sales and other operating revenue” and “Other taxes and duties”).
The Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is
incurred.
Derivative Instruments
The Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices,
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that arise from existing assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted
transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value.
Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met.
Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the
derivative. All gains and losses from derivative instruments for which the Corporation does not apply hedge accounting are
immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value
hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings.
For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive
income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
Fair Value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs
other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3
inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Inventories
Crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined
under the last-in, first-out method – LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly
and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and
administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are
valued at cost or less.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Cost Basis. The Corporation uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under
this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property
(whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found
a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where the Corporation is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these
criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed
as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the
unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into
consideration.
Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil
and natural gas reserve volumes. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable
extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and
gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production
method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or
sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.
In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an
upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the
asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil
and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset
is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.
76
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the
resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated
using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful
quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.
Investments in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-
line basis over a 25-year life. Service station buildings and fixed improvements are generally depreciated over a 20-year life.
Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are
capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.
Impairment Assessment. The Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Among the events or changes in
circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following:
•a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
•a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition including a
significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes;
•a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including an adverse
action or assessment by a regulator;
•an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
•a current-period operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
•a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly
before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year.
This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation’s planning and
budgeting cycle. Asset valuation analysis, profitability reviews and other periodic control processes assist the Corporation in
assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable.
Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these
assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices, industry margins, and development and
production costs. Significant reductions in the Corporation’s view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges,
especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce, or
eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances, can be
indicators of potential impairment as well.
In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes
that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices
will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand
fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to
generate production from new discoveries, field developments and technology, and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment
activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general
economic activities, alternative energy sources and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation
expects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will
experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating
losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.
In the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas
Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These
prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation’s price assumptions which are used for
impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected
future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas
reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for
an impairment assessment.
77
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Energy Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the
mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for
the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the Energy Outlook, which contains the Corporation’s demand and supply
projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and
economic development. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not project the degree of
required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net-zero by 2050. As
future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Energy Outlook, and the Corporation’s
business plans will be updated accordingly.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates
the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this
assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the
cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on assumptions which are developed
in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management
uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation’s assumptions of future capital
allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes,
development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are
based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management’s estimate of upstream production
volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve
quantities. The greenhouse gas emission prices reflect existing or anticipated policy actions that countries or localities may take in
support of Paris Accord pledges. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
Fair value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's
carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair
value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates
of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash
flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future
production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party
industry experts and government agencies, refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs and
discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.
Other Impairments Related to Property, Plant and Equipment. Unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine
whether they have been impaired. Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation
allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's future development plans, the estimated economic
chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually
significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.
Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its
fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and
adjusted to the lower value. Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty
about the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future performance by the
Corporation.
Interest costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the
historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed
engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in
property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.
Environmental Liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures
are not discounted.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary
economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Downstream and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency.
However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and Singapore, which
predominantly sells into the U.S. dollar export market. Upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and integrated
within a particular country, such as in Canada and Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and
Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.
For all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in
income.

2. Restructuring Activities
During 2020, ExxonMobil conducted an extensive global review of staffing levels and subsequently commenced targeted
workforce reductions within a number of countries to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The programs were completed by the
end of 2021 and included both voluntary and involuntary employee separations as well as reductions in contractors.
In 2021, the Corporation recorded before-tax charges of $58 million, consisting primarily of employee separation costs, associated
with announced workforce reduction programs in Singapore and Europe. These costs are captured in “Selling, general and
administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income and reported within Corporate and Financing. The Corporation
does not expect any further charges related to the previously disclosed workforce reduction programs.
The following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to the workforce reduction programs announced in late 2020 and
early 2021. These are recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and do not include
charges related to employee reductions associated with any portfolio changes or other projects.

Research and development expenses totaled $843 million in 2021, $1,016 million in 2020, and $1,214 million in 2019.
Net income included before-tax aggregate foreign exchange transaction losses of $18 million, $24 million and $104 million in
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In 2021, 2020, and 2019, net income included gains of $54 million, $41 million, and $523 million, respectively, attributable to the
combined effects of LIFO inventory accumulations and drawdowns. The aggregate replacement cost of inventories was estimated
to exceed their LIFO carrying values by $14.0 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Crude oil, products and merchandise as of year-end 2021 and 2020 consist of the following:

Mainly as a result of declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products and a significant decline in its market
capitalization at the end of the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation recognized before-tax goodwill impairment charges of
$611 million in Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical reporting units. Fair value of the goodwill reporting units primarily reflected
market-based estimates of historical EBITDA multiples at the end of the first quarter. Charges related to goodwill impairments in
2020 are included in “Depreciation and depletion” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

5. Cash Flow Information
The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides information about changes in cash and cash equivalents. Highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents.
For 2021, the “Net (gain)/loss on asset sales” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes before-tax amounts from the
sale of non-operated upstream assets in the United Kingdom Central and Northern North Sea and the sale of ExxonMobil's global
Santoprene business. The United Kingdom Central and Northern North Sea assets were sold to Neo Energy, resulting in a before-
tax gain of $0.4 billion and cash proceeds of $0.7 billion in 2021. The Santoprene business, including two chemical manufacturing
sites in Pensacola, Florida and Newport, Wales, was sold to Celanese, resulting in a before-tax gain of $0.8 billion and cash
proceeds of $1.1 billion in 2021. For 2019, the “Net (gain)/loss on asset sales” line includes before-tax amounts from the sale of
non-operated upstream assets in Norway and upstream asset transactions in the U.S. The Norway assets were sold for $4.5 billion,
resulting in a gain of $3.7 billion and cash proceeds of $3.1 billion in 2019.
For 2020, the “Depreciation and depletion” and “Deferred income tax charges/(credits)” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash

7. Equity Company Information
The summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain less-than-majority-owned companies and
majority-owned subsidiaries where minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant management decisions (see
Note 1). These companies are primarily engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, and natural gas marketing in North
America; natural gas exploration, production and distribution in Europe; liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations and transportation
of crude oil in Africa; and exploration, production, LNG operations, and the manufacture and sale of petroleum and petrochemical
products in Asia and the Middle East. Also included are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing and marketing ventures.
The share of total equity company revenues from sales to ExxonMobil consolidated companies was 10 percent, 11 percent and
13 percent in the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Corporation’s ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint ventures as well as interests in
partnerships. Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets
of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the factors
giving rise to the difference. The amortization of this difference, as appropriate, is included in “Income from equity affiliates” on
the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Impairments related to upstream equity investments of $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in
“Income from equity affiliates” or “Other income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

In 2021, the Corporation identified situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of certain
long-lived assets may not be recoverable and performed impairment assessments. Before-tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion,
including impairments of suspended wells, were recognized during the year largely as a result of changes to Upstream development
plans.
In 2020, as part of the Corporation's annual review and approval of its business and strategic plan, a decision was made to no longer
develop a significant portion of the dry gas portfolio in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. The impairment of these assets resulted in
before-tax charges of $24.4 billion in Upstream. Other before-tax impairment charges in 2020 included $0.9 billion in Upstream,
$0.5 billion in Downstream, and $0.1 billion in Chemical. In 2019, before-tax impairment charges were $0.1 billion.
Impairment charges are primarily recognized in the lines “Depreciation and depletion” and “Exploration expenses, including dry
holes” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $278,510 million at the end of
2021 and $277,769 million at the end of 2020.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a
discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses
assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation, technical
assessments of the assets, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount rates, and inflation rates. Asset retirement
obligations incurred in the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements. The costs associated with these liabilities are
capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the
change in their present value.
Asset retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are permanently
shut down and dismantled. These obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation. However,
these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal
obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.
The following table summarizes the activity in the liability for asset retirement obligations:

2022 and 2023 are $645 million and $648 million, respectively.

10. Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Well Costs
The Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
The following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended exploratory well costs as well as an aging
summary of those costs.

11. Leases
The Corporation and its consolidated affiliates generally purchase the property, plant and equipment used in operations, but there
are situations where assets are leased, primarily for drilling equipment, tankers, office buildings, railcars, and other moveable
equipment. Right of use assets and lease liabilities are established on the balance sheet for leases with an expected term greater than
one year by discounting the amounts fixed in the lease agreement for the duration of the lease which is reasonably certain,
considering the probability of exercising any early termination and extension options. The portion of the fixed payment related to
service costs for drilling equipment, tankers and finance leases is excluded from the calculation of right of use assets and lease
liabilities. Generally, assets are leased only for a portion of their useful lives, and are accounted for as operating leases. In limited
situations assets are leased for nearly all of their useful lives, and are accounted for as finance leases.
Variable payments under these lease agreements are not significant. Residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants related to
leases, and transactions with related parties are also not significant. In general, leases are capitalized using the incremental
borrowing rate of the leasing affiliate. The Corporation’s activities as a lessor are not significant.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the
Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices,
currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage
commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated
Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue”. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are
not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of
which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, or results of operations for 2021,
2020 and 2019.
Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative
clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system
of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
The net notional long/(short) position of derivative instruments at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, was as follows:

14. Long-Term Debt
At December 31, 2021, long-term debt consisted of $37,611 million due in U.S. dollars and $5,817 million representing the U.S.
dollar equivalent at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. These amounts exclude that portion of long-
term debt, totaling $2,392 million, which matures within one year and is included in current liabilities.
On December 17, 2021, the Corporation irrevocably deposited sufficient cash with the Trustee to fund the redemption of its
2.397% notes due 2022. After the deposit of the funds, the Corporation was released from its obligation and the debt was
extinguished.
The amounts of long-term debt, excluding finance lease obligations, maturing in each of the four years after December 31, 2022, in
millions of dollars, are: 2023 – $4,039; 2024 – $3,836; 2025 – $4,597; and 2026 – $3,575. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation's
unused long-term lines of credit were $0.6 billion.
The Corporation may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as hedges of its net
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Under this method, the change in the carrying value of the financial instruments due to
foreign exchange fluctuations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation
has designated its $5.1 billion of Euro-denominated long-term debt and related accrued interest as a net investment hedge of its
European business. The net investment hedge is deemed to be perfectly effective.

15. Incentive Program
The 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and other
forms of awards. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned.
Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and SARs
may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The
maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited,
expire, or are settled in cash, do not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term.
New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. At the end of 2021,
remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 66 million.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Awards totaling 8,133 thousand, 8,681 thousand, and 8,936 thousand of restricted
(nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is
based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these
awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in
fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or
transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and
units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven years. Awards granted to a small
number of senior executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years for the remaining 50
percent of the award, except that for awards granted prior to 2020 the vesting of the 10-year portion of the award is delayed until
retirement if later than 10 years.
The following tables summarize information about restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2021, there was $1,268 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested restricted awards.
This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.4 years. The compensation cost charged against income
for the restricted stock and restricted stock units was $612 million, $672 million, and $741 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019,
respectively. The income tax benefit recognized in income related to this compensation expense was $49 million, $51 million, and
$51 million for the same periods, respectively. The fair value of shares and units vested in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $562 million,
$367 million, and $647 million, respectively. Cash payments of $48 million, $34 million, and $56 million for vested restricted stock
units settled in cash were made in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

16. Litigation and Other Contingencies
Litigation. A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of
pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the
need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those
contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be
reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is
accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies
where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the
contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant”
includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not
believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the
Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
Other Contingencies. The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2021,
for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other
similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business
activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or
financial condition.
The Corporation has previously provided disclosure regarding (i) claims being pursued by the Corporation against the Venezuelan
National Oil Company in connection with a 2007 Venezuelan nationalization decree, and (ii) claims being pursued by the
Corporation against the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in connection with a dispute involving crude oil lifting
entitlements which was originally subject to arbitration in 2011. Both matters remain ongoing but, as previously disclosed, the
Corporation does not expect the ultimate resolution of either matter to have a material effect upon the Corporation’s operations or
financial condition. In the interest of disclosure simplification, the Corporation will no longer include specific disclosure of these
matters in its annual or quarterly reports unless future developments alter the foregoing conclusions.

(3)For 2021 and 2020, other postretirement benefits paid are net of $9 million and $16 million of Medicare subsidy receipts,
respectively.
 
For selection of the discount rate for U.S. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest rate market
indicators and the effective discount rate determined by use of a yield curve based on high-quality, noncallable bonds applied to the
estimated cash outflows for benefit payments. For major non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is determined by using a spot yield curve
of high-quality, local-currency-denominated bonds at an average maturity approximating that of the liabilities.
The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.0 percent in 2023
and subsequent years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The funding levels of all qualified pension plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or regulation. As shown in
the table below, certain smaller U.S. pension plans and a number of non-U.S. pension plans are not funded because local applicable
tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. All defined benefit pension obligations, regardless of the
funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring
affiliate.

The long-term expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established for each benefit plan by developing a forward-
looking, long-term return assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the
specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.

The Corporation’s investment strategy for benefit plan assets reflects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the risks inherent in
plan assets and liabilities and broad diversification to reduce the risk of the portfolio. The benefit plan assets are primarily invested
in passive global equity and local currency fixed income index funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. The equity funds
hold ExxonMobil stock only to the extent necessary to replicate the relevant equity index. The fixed income funds are largely
invested in investment grade corporate and government debt securities with interest rate sensitivity designed to approximate the
interest rate sensitivity of plan liabilities.
Target asset allocations for benefit plans are reviewed periodically and set based on considerations such as risk, diversification,
liquidity and funding level. The target asset allocations for the major benefit plans range from 10 to 30 percent in equity securities
and the remainder in fixed income securities. The equity for the U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans include allocations to private
equity partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage venture capital of less than 5 percent.
The fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different methods of valuing assets. The terms do not represent
the relative risk or credit quality of an investment.

18. Disclosures about Segments and Related Information
The Upstream, Downstream and Chemical functions best define the operating segments of the business that are reported separately.
The factors used to identify these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are undertaken by each
segment. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. The Chemical segment is organized and operates to
manufacture and sell petrochemicals. These segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical industries.
These functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Corporation because they are the segments (1) that engage in
business activities from which revenues are recognized and expenses are incurred; (2) whose operating results are regularly
reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and
to assess its performance; and (3) for which discrete financial information is available.
Earnings after income tax include transfers at estimated market prices.
In Corporate and Financing, interest revenue relates to interest earned on cash deposits and marketable securities. Interest expense
includes non-debt-related interest expense of $103 million in 2021, $148 million in 2020 and $105 million in 2019.

The Corporation’s undistributed earnings from subsidiary companies outside the United States include amounts that have been
retained to fund prior and future capital project expenditures. Deferred income taxes have not been recorded for potential future tax
obligations, such as foreign withholding tax and state tax, as these undistributed earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested
for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2021, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability.
However, unrecognized deferred taxes on remittance of these funds are not expected to be material.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits. The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. The benefits of
uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial
statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a
position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is
greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the difference between positions taken or
expected to be taken on income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The following table summarizes
the movement in unrecognized tax benefits: 
Gross unrecognized tax benefits 2021 2020 2019

Balance at December 31 9,130 8,764 8,844 
108
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The gross unrecognized tax benefit balances are predominantly related to tax positions that would reduce the Corporation’s
effective tax rate if the positions are favorably resolved. Unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally would not increase
the effective tax rate. The 2021, 2020 and 2019 changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the
Corporation’s net income.
Resolution of these tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax authorities or through litigation will take many years to
complete. It is difficult to predict the timing of resolution for these tax positions since the timing is not entirely within the control of
the Corporation. In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The Corporation filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in U.S.
federal district court (District Court) with respect to the positions at issue for those years. These positions are reflected in the
unrecognized tax benefits table. On February 24, 2020, the Corporation received an adverse ruling on this suit. The IRS has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense
because the Corporation does not expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. On January 13, 2021, the District Court
ruled that no penalties apply to the Corporation's positions in this suit. The Corporation and the government have appealed the
District Court's rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit). Proceedings in the Fifth Circuit are
continuing. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a material adverse effect on the
Corporation’s operations or financial condition.
It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase by up to 10 percent or decrease by up to
70 percent in the next 12 months. Such a decrease would result primarily from final resolution of the U.S. federal income tax
litigation within this timeframe.
The following table summarizes the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction:

The Corporation classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense or interest income and classifies tax-related
penalties as operating expense.
For 2021 and 2019 the Corporation's net interest expense was $0 million on income tax reserves. For 2020, the Corporation's net
interest expense was a credit of $6 million. The related interest payable balances were $61 million at both December 31, 2021 and
2020.

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs
The amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated subsidiaries are $12,005 million less at year-end 2021 and $13,206
million less at year-end 2020 than the amounts reported as investments in property, plant and equipment for the Upstream in Note
9. This is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of certain transportation and research assets and assets relating to LNG
operations. Assets related to oil sands and oil shale mining operations are included in the capitalized costs in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board rules.

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs (continued)
The amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs charged to expense during the year. Costs incurred
also include new asset retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or decreases to the asset retirement
obligation resulting from changes in cost estimates or abandonment date. Total consolidated costs incurred in 2021 were
$9,877 million, down $1,377 million from 2020, due primarily to lower development costs, partially offset by higher acquisition
costs of unproved properties. In 2020, costs were $11,254 million, down $7,986 million from 2019, due primarily to lower
development costs including lower asset retirement obligation cost estimates mainly in Angola. Total equity company costs
incurred in 2021 were $1,451 million, down $561 million from 2020, due primarily to lower development costs.

Oil and Gas Reserves
The following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020
and 2021.
The definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.
Proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering
data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs,
and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new
investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules, the Corporation’s year-end reserves volumes as well as
the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the
12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-
production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.
Revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to
the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or
production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation
of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility
capacity.
Proved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation in proved reserves and ExxonMobil’s
ownership percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas
reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at
gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.
In the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation
does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.
Reserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined
by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary
inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the
company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of
the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated
subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12
percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million
barrels).
Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net
proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
Crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil’s oil
and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing
function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.
The changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion
barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition,
extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9
GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.
The downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6
billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation’s near-term reduction in
capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved reserves of approximately 1.5 GOEB, mainly related to
unconventional drilling in the United States.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows
As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is
computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices, year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10
percent to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation
obligations. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected
future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil
and gas reserves. The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of-the-
month average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from
year to year as prices change.
